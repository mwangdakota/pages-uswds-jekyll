## AIM Photonics Capabilities
 
The American Institute of Manufacturing of Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics) ([https://www.aimphotonics.com](https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.aimphotonics.com/)) is a public-private-partnership that focuses the nation's premiere capabilities and expertise to capture and mature critical manufacturing domestic capability for integrated photonics. The Institute's mission is to seek to advance integrated photonic circuit manufacturing technology development while simultaneously providing access to state-of-the-art fabrication, packaging, and testing capabilities for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), academia and the government.
 
Research projects utilizing the AIM Photonics fabrication process technologies via multi-project wafer (MPW) runs should have an objective to bring a specific innovation to integrated photonics circuits and components or to demonstrate a new approach that uses integrated photonics as its differentiator. For proposals submitted to NSF and recommended for funding following merit review, the grantee's cost of the chip may be discounted by 50% of the stated cost by AIM, based on available space on the MPW shuttle run. Test, assembly and packaging services may be discounted by 15% of the stated cost. Note that MPW shuttle runs at discounted rates are offered on a space-available basis only. It is recommended that the grantee check with AIM Photonics for run scheduling well in advance of the design due date.
