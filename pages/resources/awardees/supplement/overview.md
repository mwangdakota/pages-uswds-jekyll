# Supplemental funding overview


__Only applicable for SBIR and STTR Phase II awardees.__


America's Seed Fund powered by NSF is committed to assisting Phase II awardees to successfully commercialize their innovation research, grow their company, and to create jobs by attracting new investments and partnerships. To reinforce these commitments, the program supports a broad number of supplements and other opportunities.

**Please notify your Program Director of your intention to submit a supplemental funding request before preparing and submitting a proposal.** Supplemental funding is only available for active Phase II awardees. Please note: A no-cost extension does not extend the eligibility period for supplements. You will not be eligible to apply for or receive supplemental funding after your original award period has ended unless you have received a Technology Enhancement for Commercial Partnerships (TECP) award and the award includes an extension of your Phase II award period.
