# Revised budget

Phase I SBIR/STTR awardees must request permission from their program director to revise the budget. Please email your program director for permission.
 
If your program director approves revising a budget, you can submit a revised budget in <a href="https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page">Research.gov</a>. 
 
Please note: A revised budget is not submitted to the NSF until both the companyâ€™s Principal Investigator (PI) and someone with Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) privileges have also signed off in Research.gov.  This may require two separate logins and approvals in different locations in Research.gov.
 
Once you have submitted your revised budget, please email your program director a copy of the budget and budget justification in a combined PDF document (no larger than 5 MB.) 
 
If you have any questions or issues with Research.gov, please contact the Research.gov Help Desk at <a href="mailto:rgov@nsf.gov">rgov@nsf.gov</a> or 1-800-381-1532.
