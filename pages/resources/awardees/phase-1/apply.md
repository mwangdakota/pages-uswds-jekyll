## Eligibility and the basics

- Only recent NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I awardees may apply for Phase II funding. See your Phase I award letter for details about when you are eligible to submit a Phase II proposal. 
- The purpose of Phase II is to provide funding to continue the research and development you began in Phase I.
- You are permitted to submit only one Phase II proposal per Phase I award.
- If your Phase II application is declined, you won't be able to resubmit it.

## Award amount 

- As of summer 2020, Phase II awards are funded up to $1 million for up to 24 months.

## Technical narrative 

You must submit a Phase I technical narrative as a component of your Phase II proposal. This is a report describing progress during your Phase I project.  

- If you choose to submit your Phase II proposal after the Phase I project ends, the Phase I [final report]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/awardees/phase-1/final-report/) will fulfill this requirement.  

- If you submit your Phase II proposal before the Phase I project ends, an interim Phase I progress report, based on the format discussed above and covering all relevant progress made to date, should be included in your Phase II proposal. 

- To make the Phase II application process as smooth as possible, the Phase I final or interim report should be prepared offline and uploaded as a stand-alone PDF file.

## Submission info

- A company may generally submit a Phase II proposal anytime between six (6) months and two years (24 months) after the start date of the relevant Phase I award. Details can be found in the Phase II solicitation. 
- You must submit your Phase II SBIR or STTR proposal through [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-web/).
- If you’re an STTR Phase I awardee, you can now submit a SBIR Phase II proposal (or vice-versa). [More information on switching from STTR to SBIR](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14103).

## Administrative and financial capability reviews

- If your Phase II proposal is considered potentially meritorious for funding, you will be required to undergo an [administrative and financial capability review](http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/caar/sbirrev.jsp) in the latter stages of the Phase II review process.
- [These videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhBP1C7iCOmI1p5UtqYCXzmUL9SzSApv) also explain the review processes and how to prepare for them.
