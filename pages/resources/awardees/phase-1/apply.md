## Eligibility and the basics

- Only recent NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I awardees may apply for Phase II funding.
- The purpose of Phase II is to provide funding to continue the research and development you began in Phase I.
- You are permitted to submit only one Phase II proposal per Phase I award.
- If your Phase II application is declined, you won't be able to resubmit it.

## Award amount 

- As of summer 2020, Phase II awards are funded up to $1 million for up to 24 months.
- This amount includes up to $50,000 to be used by the Phase II awardee for commercial assistance under the SBIR [Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) legislation]({{ site.data.solicitations['PHASE_II'].url }}) for details.

## Technical narrative 

You must submit a technical narrative as a component of your Phase II proposal.  

- If you choose to submit your Phase II proposal after the Phase I project ends, the [final report]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/awardees/phase-1/final-report/) will fulfill this requirement.  

- If you submit your Phase II proposal before the Phase I project ends, an interim report, based on the format discussed above and covering all relevant progress made to date, should be included.  

- To make the Phase II application process as smooth as possible, the final report or interim report should be prepared offline and uploaded as a stand-alone PDF file.  

## Submission info
