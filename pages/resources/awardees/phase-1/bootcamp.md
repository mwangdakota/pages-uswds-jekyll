# Boot Camp

The NSF SBIR “Beat-the-Odds Boot Camp” provides Phase I awardees with entrepreneurial training designed for early-stage companies that draws on the methods and customer discovery curriculum used in the [NSF I-Corps™](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/) Program. 

Taught by National I-Corps instructors, the Boot Camp provides an immersive experience that pushes companies to develop stronger business models, market strategies, and successful products. The main goal is to provide early-stage companies with an introduction, or refresher, in customer discovery and business model validation. 

The Boot Camp is held in a virtual format four times per year and lasts about two months, requiring about 10-20 hours per week from the participating team. At the end of the program, companies will understand how to verify product market fit and other business model elements.
