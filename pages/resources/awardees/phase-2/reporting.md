# Phase II reporting

  
  
If your **Phase II proposal was submitted in the year 2020 or later**, please download and follow the instructions in [Phase II Interim Report PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/awardees/NSF_Interim_Report_Fillable.pdf). 

If your **Phase II proposal was submitted in the year 2019 or earlier**, please follow the instructions below.

All reporting is administered through Research.gov. Please see [Research.gov reporting information](http://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_page_n_about_por) for technical guidance and tips on the submission process. Contact the Research.gov help desk by email at [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) or call 1-800-381-1532. The requirements expected for the SBIR/STTR program are detailed below.


Phase II awardees must submit Interim Progress Reports, and a Phase II Final Report. Interim reports must be submitted within 30 days after each six-month period. Research.gov indicates that the Interim Progress Reports are optional. However, **please disregard this statement as Interim Project Reports are a requirement of all Phase II awards**. The Phase II Final Report is required to be submitted 90 days following the expiration of the award. Final payments will not be made and pending future proposals will not be processed until any overdue final reports are submitted and approved.   

Note: No-cost extensions do not change the requirement for six-month interim reports. For award guidance please reference the appropriate link: [Phase I](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=sbiri212) or [Phase II](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=sbirii212).  

Note: The Interim Report (IPR) reporting period is autopopulated to include only the date that the report was created (e.g., 05/01/2013 - 05/01/2013). This is a problem with the system that you cannot correct; please proceed with the report as normal.  

If the instructions on this website conflict with instructions provided to you by NSF via email or another NSF web page, the instructions on this page supersede all other instructions!

## Interim Report

(Interim Progress Reports are used for reporting progress typically at the 6, 12, and 18-month performance periods). Note: If you receive a Phase IIB supplement, you are required to provide progress reports, typically at six-month intervals until the award ends. Phase II progress reports must be submitted through Research.gov.

### Cover page

Each progress report must contain updated Project Milestone Information. A template is provided in .XLSX format but MUST be converted to PDF upon completion in order to be uploaded into Research.gov. This chart should follow the format used in the Phase II proposal document and reflect the cumulative effort and expenditures. The following are required:

4. Status of commercialization activities and a discussion of any commercialization challenges faced during the interim reporting period. Also provide insight into planned commercialization activities for the next reporting period.

### Final report

The report must be submitted via [research.gov](http://www.research.gov/) no later than 15 days after the end of your award. We encourage you to include not only the data you obtained during the project, but also discuss the results and how they may inform your future technical and commercialization plans. [Follow the guide]( {{site.baseurl}}/resources/awardees/phase-1/reporting/) to submit your final report.

The final report must show your results and actual data for each research objective and task funded by NSF. You should also discuss progress made by your company during Phase I in other, non-NSF-funded aspects, such as business development, customer and partner engagements, fundraising, and building your team.

### Project outcomes report

At the conclusion of the Phase I award, you are also required to submit a brief (maximum-800-word) project outcomes report (via [research.gov](http://research.gov/)) which will be made available to the public on the outcomes of your NSF-funded work. The report is public and should not contain confidential or proprietary information. This report is not reviewed or approved by NSF. For more information, view [NSF Report Your Progress and Outcomes page](https://new.nsf.gov/awards/report-your-outcomes#:~:text=Final%20annual%20project%20reports%20must%20be%20submitted%20in%20Research.gov.&text=This%20report%20serves%20as%20a,date%20of%20your%20NSF%20award).

Progress reports provide information which justifies progress payments. Inadequate content, format, or time expenditure details will delay approval of interim progress payments. Under the standard payment schedule for Phase II awards (typically 24-months), one report is required within one month after the end of each respective progress period.
