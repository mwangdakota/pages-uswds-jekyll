# PI change request

 
In the event that your Principal Investigator changes during your award term, you’ll need to log into Research.gov and access the Account Management system. The system includes pages for Administrators to manage user and organization information and pages for users to self-manage their roles and profile information. Access these pages and the updated functionality by signing in to [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-web/) and clicking on the “**My Profile**” link in the top right. 

Visit the [Research.gov Account Management About page](https://www.research.gov/research-web/content/aboutaccountmanagement) to download instructions and for navigating the system.
