# Revising a budget

To successfully submit a revised budget request to NSF, both a projectâ€™s PI and sponsored research officer must send in the revision in [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page).  All revised budget requests must include a **Revised Budget Justification**. View the [Research.gov instructions for revising a budget](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/How to Submit PFUs and Budget Revisions_Final_508.pdf).

Once you have submitted your revised budget, please email your program director a copy of the budget and budget justification in a combined PDF document (no larger than 5 MB.) 

If you have any questions or issues with Research.gov, please contact the Research.gov Help Desk at [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) or 1-800-381-1532.
