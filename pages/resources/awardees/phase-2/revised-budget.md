# Revising a budget

To successfully submit a revised budget request to NSF, both a project’s PI and sponsored research officer must send in the revision in [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page).  All revised budget requests must include a **Revised Budget Justification**. View the [Research.gov instructions for revising a budget](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/How to Submit PFUs and Budget Revisions_Final_508.pdf).

Once you have submitted your revised budget, please email your program director a copy of the budget and budget justification in a combined PDF document (no larger than 5 MB.) 

If you have any questions or issues with Research.gov, please contact the Research.gov Help Desk at [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) or 1-800-381-1532.

## How to prepare a revised budget

1. On the [FastLane website](http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov), click the `Proposals, Awards, & Status` link (left-hand side of the page).
2. Enter your login information into the `PI/Co-PI Login` field and log in.
3. Click the `Proposal Functions` link.
4. Click the `Revised Submitted Proposal Budget` link.
5. Highlight your proposal and click the `View` button.
6. You'll be taken to the `Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) Proposal Revised Budget` page. Click the radio button next to `Edit the Budget` and then click OK.
7. `Year One` will appear under the Year column next to the organization name. To edit the budget for year one, click `Funds`.
8. The year one budget will display onscreen, and you'll be able to make any changes you need to. Once you've made your changes, click `Calculate and Save`.
9. Repeat steps seven and eight to revise additional years' budgets, if needed.
10. Now you need to upload your new or revised Budget Justification. From the main `Project Budget` page, upload your entire revised budget justification (including supporting documentation) using the `Budget Impact Statement` module.  


At this point, you still haven't submitted your budget to NSF. Please read the instructions on "How to submit a revised budget” to learn how to complete the process.
