## Submit a Project Pitch for feedback 

Are you hoping for feedback? We encourage you to submit a Project Pitch. It’s the first step in our process and the best way to learn more about whether your work would be a good fit for the National Science Foundation. Plus, it provides our staff with the information they need to guide you in the process.
