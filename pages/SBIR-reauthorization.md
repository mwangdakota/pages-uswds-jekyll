## Important Information Relating to the Status of SBIR/STTR Authorization
  
Congressional authorization for the SBIR and STTR programs ends September 30, 2022. Long-term stability and program improvement rely on SBIR/STTR reauthorization and a lapse in authorization would have impacts on NSF and the community of small businesses that we support.
  
For current SBIR/STTR awardees, your awards will not be impacted by an authorization lapse.
  
NSF intends to continue to support new startups and small businesses with research and development funding. The underlying research authorities that allow NSF to award grants and cooperative agreements to startups and small businesses for research and development will continue to be in effect. During a period of lapse in the SBIR and STTR authorization, NSF may not be subject to the mandates of the statute; however, the Foundation is not precluded from continuing to set aside funds for awards to small businesses for research and development.
