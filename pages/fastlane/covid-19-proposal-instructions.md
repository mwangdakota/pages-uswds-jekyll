# COVID-19 Proposal Instructions

NSF archived the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) on the “Request for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals Addressing COVID-19” (NSF 20-065). 

The NSF Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program continues to encourage small businesses to submit a Project Pitch for research and development related to COVID-19. Please choose from the existing NSF technology topic areas and include a description about how the proposed technology will make an impact on the current crisis. NSF remains open to small business inquiries concerning COVID-19 research.

Companies that received an invitation to submit a proposal (based on an invited COVID-19 Project Pitch) should submit their NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposals through Fastlane. All small businesses with **an invited COVID-19-related Project Pitch** are still welcome to submit a full proposal related to COVID-19 within a year of their official invitation. However, now that the COVID-19 DCL has been archived, the full proposal should be prepared under the  guidance for a Phase I SBIR/STTR proposal in [NSF 20-527](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20527/nsf20527.htm) or [NSF 20-528](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20528/nsf20528.htm).  Phase I proposals are reviewed within 4-6 months of receipt.

Follow the NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I solicitation guidelines with the following additional guidance:

* The term “COVID-19” must be in the proposal title.
* You cannot choose the DCL number in FastLane. Instead, please pick the Phase I SBIR (NSF 20-527) or STTR (NSF 20-528) solicitation from the dropdown in the FastLane submission system. 

As is the case for all NSF proposers, the proposing organization is required to have an active [registration]({{site.baseurl}}/fastlane/registrations/) with the System for Award Management (at SAM.gov) to register in Research.gov and prepare a full proposal. SAM.gov registration is not needed to submit a Project Pitch but can take days or weeks to obtain. Interested small business should plan accordingly.

Small businesses that are interested in submitting NSF SBIR or STTR Phase I proposals in response to the COVID-19 crisis must follow the guidelines outlined in the NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I solicitations ([see here for submission details]({{ site.baseurl }}/fastlane/), including the submission of a required Project Pitch. Companies that already have an active NSF SBIR/STTR award with NSF must also submit a Project Pitch first.

When submitting a Project Pitch:
* Select the most relevant SBIR/STTR topic area on the Project Pitch form
* Reference the word “COVID-19” and in the “Describe the Technology/Innovation” field.
* All questions about COVID-19-related research should be addressed directly to a cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Director for the NSF program with which the research would be most closely aligned.
