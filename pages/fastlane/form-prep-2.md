**IMPORTANT: To avoid budget reductions, NSF strongly advises you to visit the Department of Labor/Bureau of Labor Statistics website to determine the allowed pay scale for each budgeted position. In general, unless your company has other significant internal revenue sources, as well as recent payroll records showing a precedent for the requested salary, the NSF will not allow budgeted salaries in excess of the median salary for the same job title in the same geographical area. Click here to search for your city/state data. If your city is not listed, click here and use your state data. Remember that direct salaries and wages requested in an NSF SBIR/STTR budget are permitted only for work on R&D tasks.**

In most cases, every employee listed in line A or B of the budget should fall under one of the following four occupational groups:
- [Management Occupations (11-0000)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#11-0000) Please note that NSF does not recognize C-level positions on an SBIR/STTR budget.
- [Computer and Mathematical Occupations (15-0000)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#15-0000)
- [Architecture and Engineering Occupations (17-0000)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#17-0000)
- [Life, Physical, and Social Science Occupations (19-0000)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#19-0000)

- **The small business concern should NOT budget any personnel or funds for "Post-Doctoral Scholars", "Graduate Students" or "Undergraduate Students".**
- In the Budget Justification, please include the actual annual salary information that justifies the calculation of the amounts requested (which should match the line item in the Budget) for all personnel in the project.

**C. Fringe Benefits section:** Provide the estimated amount of fringe benefits for Senior Personnel and Other Personnel; then click "Calculate".

It is recommended that proposers allot funds for fringe benefits here ONLY if the proposer's usual (established) accounting practices provide that fringe benefits be treated as direct costs. Otherwise, fringe benefits should be included in Line I, Indirect costs. (Line I+ Line C) should not be more than 150% of (Line A + Line B).

![Fringe Benefits section with input box labeled Funds Requested By Proposer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fastlane/11-FringeBenefits.jpg)

  G.2. Publication Costs/Documentation/distrib (generally not allowed in SBIR/STTR Phase I)  
  G.3. Consultant Services  
  G.4. Computer (ADPE) Services  
  G.5. Subcontracts - a separate budget is REQUIRED for each subcontractor; the total amount of all these subcontracts should be entered here. (In the small business concern's Budget Justification, please include a few sentences describing the scope and objective of the subaward.)  
  G.6.Other  
  First, the applicant may budget up to $10,000 as a direct charge on line G.6 to this Phase I award for the following specific purposes related to financials and accounting:
  * Hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare audited, compiled, or reviewed financial statements
  * Hiring a CPA to perform an initial financial viability assessment based on standard financial ratios so the awardee organization would have time to improve their financial position prior to submitting the Phase II proposal
  * Hiring a CPA to review the adequacy of the awardee's project cost accounting system
  * Purchasing a project cost accounting system

If the applicant elects to budget funds for one of the above purposes, the budget justification should include a brief description of the desired use of funds, and the use of funds must be approved by the cognizant Program Director, prior to award.

Second, the applicant may budget up to $20,000 to cover costs related to NSF's "Beat-The-Odds Boot Camp" which is offered to all Phase I awardees.

This program is based on the NSF's Innovation Corps program, and more information can be found [here](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/resources/awardees/phase-1/bootcamp/). All Phase I awardees are strongly encouraged to participate in this activity. Costs that are allowable are limited to travel costs related to customer discovery (this could include costs associated with registration/attendance at events for the purpose of customer discovery) and salary/wages for team members who participated in the Boot Camp. All costs related to the Boot Camp must be in line with approved salary rates and other relevant Federal guidelines. International travel cannot be reimbursed, nor can any salary/wages for work done while outside of the United States. NSF recommends that, for the purposes of the proposal budget, applicants that plan to participate in this activity budget $10,000 and simply list this as "Boot Camp" costs in the budget justification.

### Samples

#### PLEASE REVIEW THE SAMPLE BUDGETS AND BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS BELOW

**These sample budgets provide you with the level of detail NSF requires for all SBIR/STTR proposals. Too much information is always better than not enough. If you have questions regarding the budget preparation call the cognizant Program Director for guidance and clarification.**

##### Sample budget populated as PDF:

![PDF of example proposal budget filled out]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fastlane/29-BudgetEx1.jpg)  
![Proposal budget example continued]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fastlane/29-BudgetEx2.jpg)

#### Sample Budget Justification:

**A.1 Senior Personnel**  
Dr. Jane Smith, Chief Technical Officer, will work two person-months on the project (line A.1) at an hourly rate of $48/hr. 2 months * 173.33hrs/month * $48/hr = $16,640.

**B. Other Personnel**  
Three other personnel will work on the project (line B.2).

An electrical engineer, Mr. Michael Jones, will spend four months of effort building the prototype amplifier circuitry, at a rate of $24/hour. 4 months * 173.33hrs/month * $24/hr =  $16,640.

Two technicians will spend a total of three months each doing electrical and mechanical characterization, respectively, at a rate of $18/hour. 6 months * 173.33hrs/month * $18/hr  = $18,720.

**C. Fringe Benefits**  
Fringe benefits are requested to cover medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees. The fringe benefits rate, based on company records, is 20% of direct labor costs.  Therefore, requested fringe benefits are 0.20 * $52,000 (total direct labor) = $10,400.

**E. Travel**  
Dr. Smith and Mr. Jones will travel to the Grantees Workshop, at an estimated cost of $2,000 per person. Total cost for this trip is $4,000. Dr. Smith will also make one two-day  trip to visit collaborators at Brown University. This trip will include round-trip airfare ($400), two nights at a hotel ($300), meals ($80), and a rental car ($150). Total cost for this trip  is $930. Total budgeted travel is $4,930.

**G.1. Materials and Supplies**  
The following is a list of materials and supplies to purchase, with quantity, unit cost, and total cost. Items with a total line item cost over $5,000 have quotes or pricing  documentation included as separate pages in this budget justification.

Chemical precursors: $150/unit, 20 units, $3,000.  
Specialized alloys: $600/kg, 10 kg, $6,000.  
Temperature sensors: $250/unit, 8 units, $2,000.   
Total budgeted materials and supplies is $11,000.  

**G.3. Consultant Services**  
Dr. I. D. Snow will be our consultant. She will work for a total of ten days (80 hours/8 hours per day) at the maximum consultant rate of $600/day. Total requested costs are  $6,000. A copy of the signed commitment letter from Dr. Snow is included with this budget justification.

**G.5. Subawards**  
One subaward has been reached with Brown University. A signed letter of commitment from the subaward lead, Dr. Fred Johnson, is included in the proposal package. A full  subaward budget and budget justification is also included with the proposal (see below). The total subaward amount is $35,000.

**G.6 Other**  
ABC Machining will manufacture two sample holders, requiring an estimated 20 hours of effort. The rate for this service is $75/hour. Total cost is 20 * $75 = $1,500. We will also  pay for use of electron microscopes at Purdue University, with a total of 10 hours budgeted. The cost for outside industrial users (see attached price list) is $200/hour, for a total  cost of $2,000. Total "other" costs are $3,500.

**I. Indirect Costs**  
The indirect rate for this project is 40% of total salaries and wages, for a total of $52,000 * 40% = $20,800.

**K. Fee**  
The fee is calculated as 4.43% of the total direct plus indirect costs (line J), or $6,370. Taking the maximum allowed fee of 7% would lead to a project budget over the $275,000  limit for Phase I.
