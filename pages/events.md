## Upcoming

We regularly host virtual office hours for startups and small businesses to learn about the application process and what we look for when we review proposals. Canâ€™t make it to office hours? Watch a [recorded webinar](https://youtu.be/oVhWWydWWc4) about the Project Pitch Pilot or a [recorded webinar](https://youtu.be/jsWEvht0s6Y) about How to Apply. For reasonable accommodations, please email [iip@nsf.gov](mailto:iip@nsf.gov) 14 days prior to the event.
