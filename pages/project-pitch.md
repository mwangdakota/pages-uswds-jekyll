<h1>Project Pitch</h1>

<p>The required Project Pitch allows startups and small businesses to get quick feedback at the start of their application for Phase I funding from America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF. </p>

<p>Startups or entrepreneurs who submit a Project Pitch* will find out if they meet the program’s objectives to support innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk. They will also get additional guidance and feedback from NSF staff. </p>

<p>If your Project Pitch is a good fit for the program, you will receive an official invitation from NSF to submit a full proposal. If you’re not invited to submit, you’ll be told why your project is not appropriate for the program. </p>

<p>Along with your company information, you’ll have to outline four key elements in your Project Pitch:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>1. The Technology Innovation. (Up to 500 words)</strong></p>

<p>Describe the technical innovation that would be the focus of a Phase I project, including a brief discussion of the origins of the innovation as well as explanation as to why it meets the program’s mandate to focus on supporting <a href="../research-and-development">research and development (R&D)</a> of unproven, high-impact innovations.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>2. The Technical Objectives and Challenges. (Up to 500 words)</strong></p>

<p>Describe the R&D or technical work to be done in a Phase I project, including a discussion of how and why the proposed work will help prove that the product or service is technically feasible and/or significantly reduce technical risk. Discuss how, ultimately, this work could contribute to making the new product, service, or process commercially viable and impactful. This section should also convey that the proposed work meets the definition of R&D, rather than straightforward engineering or incremental product development tasks.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>3. The Market Opportunity. (Up to 250 words)</strong></p>

<p>Describe the customer profile and pain point(s) that will be the near-term commercial focus related to this technical project.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>4. The Company and Team. (Up to 250 words)</strong></p>

<p>Describe the background and current status of the applicant small business, including key team members who will lead the technical and/or commercial efforts discussed in this Project Pitch.</p>
<br>

<p>Create an account to <a href="https://nsfiip.force.com/sbir" target="_blank">submit your Project Pitch</a>. More details about the NSF’s new process and eligibility requirements are on our Apply page. </p>

<p><em>*Each small business can only submit one Project Pitch at a time. Any small business with a pending Project Pitch must wait for a response before submitting another Project Pitch. Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new or revised Project Pitch.</em></p>
