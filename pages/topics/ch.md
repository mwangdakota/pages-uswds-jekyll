The Cloud and High-Performance Computing topic focuses on innovations that result in substantial improvements to cloud computing or high-performance computing platforms. These improvements may be in terms of computing power and efficiency, energy management, data storage, latency, data integrity and availability, cost, or any other factor of importance in such platforms, and may result from software- or hardware-based innovations. These subtopic areas are meant to serve as examples; all proposals with technical innovation and significant commercial potential are welcome, regardless of the specific area of focus of the project.

By the time we raised our series A from Sequoia capital, we had a handful of well-known brands as customers with annual bookings of more than $250k, i.e. real revenue. Thanks to NSF, we were on our way to commercializing our technology.” -Mohit Lad, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of ThousandEyes, a network intelligence platform for businesses, was founded by Lad and Ricardo Oliviera in 2010. In 2018, they have 220 employees and have raised nearly $110 million. </p>
