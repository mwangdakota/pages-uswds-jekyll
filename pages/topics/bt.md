The Biological Technologies topic covers a wide range of technology areas to advance engineering and science innovation across the biological spectrum. Biological technologies have disrupted decades-old chemical, agricultural and medical products and services, producing a new bioeconomy. Potential breakthroughs in this space are on course to make major socioeconomic contributions by boosting productivity in industrial and agricultural processes, improving human health, and making advances toward environmental sustainability. <br><br>
Proposed projects should be focused on using or modifying living organisms, systems or biological processes to develop new technologies to produce biochemicals and medical and agricultural products. They may involve bioengineering to improve function in molecules, cells and tissues in humans, plants, animals and microbes. NSF also encourages proposals for enabling new technologies, such as new tools for genomics, proteomics and drug discovery; instruments for biological applications; computational and bioinformatic tools; and new manufacturing technologies for cells, tissues, organs and biologics (with the exception of clinical trials and schedule I substances).<br><br>
**Subtopics are not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes.** Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, such as proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies. **Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed noncompliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and returned without review.**

      <h3>Sustainable ink from algae</h3>
      <p>Living Ink Technologies, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), is developing ink from algae cells. The Colorado-based biomaterials company is “changing the way pigments are made” to use algae as a colorant. Its sustainable algae products could replace ink made from petroleum.</p>

      <h3>Technology helps create bio-engineered organs for human transplant</h3>
      <p>More than 120,000 people are on the national organ transplant waiting list, and the list continues to grow. To meet this need, Miromatrix Medical, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), is developing a technology to create bio-engineered organs for human transplant.</p>
