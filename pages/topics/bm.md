The Biomedical Technologies topic aims to support the early-stage development of novel products, processes or services that will enable the delivery of high-quality, economically efficient healthcare.<br><br>
**Subtopics are not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes.** Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, such as proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies. **Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed noncompliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and returned without review.**
