The Augmented and Virtual Reality topic aims to support the early-stage development of technological innovations in the hardware, software, photonics, displays, communication processes and other enabling technologies. Additionally, innovations that bring evidence-based academic discoveries to the public sphere via augmented and virtual reality technologies are also appropriate. Since augmented and virtual reality technology is applicable to multiple industries, proposals to this topic should clearly identify target markets, potential paths to commercialization success as well as competitive analysis demonstrating the need for the proposed solution in advancing the entire field.
