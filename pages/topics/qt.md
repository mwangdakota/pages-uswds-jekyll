This topic focuses on innovations in information and communications technologies that rely fundamentally on quantum mechanical properties and interactions. Typically, such innovations will involve the generation, detection, or manipulation of quantum states to provide faster, more efficient or more secure information processing and communications. Proposals may include innovations at the component, sub-system, or system level that result in substantial and usable improvements in the generation, transmission, detection, storage, or processing of information, or the security and privacy of information. Proposed innovations must offer the potential for robustness, reliability, scalability, and operation at temperatures that are practical within the constraints of the intended application. Innovations at the component and sub-system level should aim for compactness and energy efficiency, consistent with the requirements of the application.

Examples of technology innovations in the quantum computing subtopic could include qubit generation and detection; development of computational models (quantum circuits, etc.); error correction; algorithms; software; hardware sub-systems and systems; and Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Examples of technology innovations in the quantum communications subtopic could include components such as sources, memories, repeaters, detectors; hardware sub-systems and systems; networks; cryptography; and key distribution.
