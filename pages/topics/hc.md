The Human Computer Interaction (HC) topic aims to support the early-stage development and prototyping of unproven technologies to increase usability of high-intensity human-computer interactive tasks. Intradisciplinary approaches to sustainable products in this topic are encouraged as HCI is an intersection of multiple disciplines, including computer science, behavioral sciences, human-centered design, media studies, and several other fields of study. Subtopics include but are not limited to: 

### HC1. Analytics 

### HC2. Conversational Interfaces 

### HC3. Dynamic and Smart Spaces 

### HC4. Embodied and Wearable Computing 

### HC5. Optometry and Human Vision 

### HC6. Tactile Technologies 

### HC7. Technology Aids for Disabilities 

### HC8. Other Human-Computer Interaction Technologies
