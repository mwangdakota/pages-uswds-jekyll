The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly evolving field that involves the interconnection and interaction of smart objects (objects or devices with embedded sensors, onboard data processing capability, and a means of communication) to provide automated services that would otherwise not be possible. IoT is not a single technology, but rather involves the convergence of sensor, actuator, information, and communication technologies. Emerging IoT implementations will use smaller and more energy-efficient embedded sensor technologies, more sophisticated actuators, enhanced communications, and advanced data analytics to collect and aggregate information and enable intelligent systems that understand context, track and manage complex interactions, and anticipate requirements. Market verticals that are potentially impacted by innovations in this area include connected cities and homes, smart transportation, smart agriculture, industrial IoT, and retail IoT.

      <h3>Small, wearable device to reduce workplace injuries</h3>
      <p>Kinetic created a small, wearable device to reduce common workplace injuries. Loaded with sensors that detect motion, twisting, bending and lifting, the device is attached to the belt or waistband of construction, factory or delivery workers. If the device detects improper biomechanics – bad posture or lifting stance – it will “buzz” to alert the worker to correct his or her stance and avert common back injuries.</p>
