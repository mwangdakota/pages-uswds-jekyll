{% capture tt_description %}
The Nanotechnology topic addresses the creation and manipulation of functional materials, devices and systems with novel properties that are achieved through the control of matter at a submicroscopic scale (from a fraction of nanometer to about 100 nanometers). This includes, but is not limited to, innovative hierarchical nanostructures, nanolayered structures, nanowires, nanotubes, quantum dots, nanoparticles, nanofibers and other nanomaterials and biomaterials and their composite structures.
