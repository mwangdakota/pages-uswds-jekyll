{% capture tt_description %}
For projects that do not seem to fit into one of the other technology topic areas, but still meet the NSF SBIR/STTR goals of supporting research and development of deep technology, with commercial viability and the potential to benefit society, please pick Other Topics and subtopic OT1. The program does not reject pitches/proposals based on a non-ideal choice of topic areas. The program routinely moves proposals/pitches internally among topic areas that seem to best describe the underlying technical innovation and to ensure the right program officer and reviewer panel sees the project.
