{% capture tt_description %}
For projects that do not seem to fit into one of the other technology topic areas, but still meet the NSF SBIR/STTR goals of supporting research and development of deep technology with commercial viability and the potential to benefit society, please pick Other Topics and subtopic OT1. Project pitches and proposals submitted to Other Topics are typically transferred and reviewed in the topic area that best matches the underlying technical innovation. The program does not reject Project Pitches or proposals based on a non-ideal choice of topic areas. The program routinely moves Project Pitches or proposals internally among topic areas that seem to best describe the underlying technical innovation and to ensure the right program officer and reviewer panel sees the project.
