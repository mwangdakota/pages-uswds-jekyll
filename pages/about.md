  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>We focus on high-risk, high-impact technologies — those that show promise but whose success hasn’t yet been validated — and each year, we award $200 million in funding to entrepreneurs across the country.</p>
  <p>Our goals are to foster innovation and help create businesses and jobs in the United States, and companies seed funded by our program have since gone on to tremendous success. We are a congressionally mandated program — Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR).</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Through the merit review process, NSF funds the most innovative ideas in science and technology. Notable NSF-supported advances include Doppler radar, the Internet, web browsers, bar codes, magnetic resonance imaging, inkjet printers, computer-aided design systems, tissue engineering, and other technology-based innovations that spur economic activity and improve the quality of life for all Americans.</p>
            <p>In selected cases, we support innovations to existing products and services, but these innovations must dramatically change the products’ commercial prospects. We don’t fund work that simply improves existing products. Check out our portfolio to get a sense of our founders’ work.</p>

## Funding for R&D with founder-friendly terms
</div>

<div class="usa-width-two-thirds about__funding">
  <ul>

<li>
                <h3>Up to $2M / 24+ months</h3>
                Receive up to $256,000 in seed capital to conduct product Research and Development (R&D) over six to 12 months. During this period, your company will be immersed in the NSF network and you’ll receive training and mentorship from seasoned entrepreneurs and innovators. After you complete your Phase I award, you’re welcome to apply for a second-round investment of $1,000,000 over 24 months. During the course of that award, you can apply for supplements that may add up to another $500,000.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Feedback from experts</h3>
                Every proposal is evaluated by a group of technical and commercial experts, who provide detailed feedback to all reviewed applications; even companies that don’t receive awards get valuable, actionable feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>NSF’s Merit Review Process</h3>
                An NSF award is more than just funding. Being selected by experts out of thousands of applicants signals that your technology and expertise have strong technical and commercial merit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>0% equity</h3>
                You retain full ownership over your company and intellectual property. And because our awards aren’t loans, there’s nothing to pay back.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Major societal impact</h3>
                We don’t have the same financial incentives as most investors, so we can make impact investments that may take longer to provide a financial return. Our goal is to invest in a better future for our shareholders: the American public.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Minimal standard reporting</h3>
                We provide templates for reporting monthly progress and financials. No need to waste time crafting decks and building spreadsheets — we help you focus on building your product or service instead.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Virtual coaching from program staff</h3>
                Our program directors, who have deep technical expertise and entrepreneurial experience, have been in your shoes And we support startups in all locations. You don’t need to relocate to gain access to our funding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Freedom to operate</h3>
                We’re not interested in driving the direction of your company; in fact, our goal is to align your vision with our funding. You can use your funding on employees’ salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and other R&D costs (though intellectual property, marketing and business development costs aren’t covered).
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Options for venture captial companies</h3>
                If your company is majority owned by venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private-equity firms, you’re not eligible to apply for funding, although joint ventures and partnerships are eligible. Read more about proposal eligibility in our <a href="#">Eligibility Guide</a>.
