  <h2>After you submit your proposal</h2>
  <p>What to expect after you’ve submitted your proposal:</p>
  <p><b>1-3 months after the window closes</b>
    <br>Proposals are reviewed by a panel of at least three technical and commercial experts. The managing Program Director also reads and conducts his/her own review.
  </p>
  <p><b>3-5 months after the window closes</b>
    <br>In some cases, a follow-on due diligence process will be conducted, in which the Principal Investigator will be asked by the Program Director to provide additional information or to answer questions.
  </p>
    <p><b>5-7 months after the window closes</b>
    <br>We'll notify you whether your proposal is accepted or declined.  Official communications about the status of your proposal will be via email to the address listed for the project’s Principal Investigator (PI).  If your proposal is awarded, you'll receive funding of up to $256,000.  Access to most of the award funds will happen at the time of the award notification.
