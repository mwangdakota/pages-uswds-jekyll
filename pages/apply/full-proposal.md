  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <p>We recommend treating the submission window like a deadline, but you can submit anytime within a year of receiving an official invitation from NSF. (NSF uses quarterly submission windows to help gather and review proposals, but sometimes proposals are reviewed as they are received).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>{{ site.solicitation_window_1 }}</li>
    <li>{{ site.solicitation_window_2 }}</li>
    <li>{{ site.solicitation_window_3 }}</li>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>Ready to get started? You'll need to read the official policy document (the solicitation) which outlines the official requirements, key elements and supplemental information you'll need to draft your proposal. We also recommend that you start the registration process right away.</p>
  <p><b>Read the call for proposals (solicitation)</b>
    <br>NSF has two Phase I solicitations: the Small Business Innovation Research (<a href="{{ site.data.solicitations['SBIR'].url }}" target="_blank">SBIR
      solicitation</a>) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (<a href="{{ site.data.solicitations['STTR'].url }}" target="_blank">STTR solicitation</a>). They are almost identical, but an SBIR proposal does not require that the startup partner with an eligible research institution. In an STTR proposal, the startup must perform a minimum of 40% of the research, as measured by the budget, and a minimum of 30% of the research must be performed by the partner research institution. </p>
  <p><b>Register your company (FREE and required)</b>
    <br>If your company hasn’t worked with the government before, you’ll need to register with these systems. You MUST
    have completed your SAM registration BEFORE you can begin entering your proposal in FastLane. Start as soon as
    possible!

            <p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to five business days</p>
            <p>A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company.
              You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for
              government funding, processing time should take about five business days.</p>

                Award Management (SAM)</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to three weeks</p>
            <p>You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through System for Award Management (SAM).
              When you register, you’ll have to share bank account information of the account where the NSF funds
              would be deposited. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can
              take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane
              account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year.</p>

            <p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to 48 hours</p>
            <p>Before applying, you need to register your company with NSF in Research.gov. Only after registering
              with Research.gov can you login to <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">FastLane</a>
              and begin preparing your proposal. (SBIR and STTR proposals are not accepted in Research.gov). We
              recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.</p>

                Registry</a></h3>
            <p>Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business
              Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll
              need to include in your FastLane application.</p>
