    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Educate the user that the following are all things that need to be done. We can include verbiage about timing and
      requirements here (they can only submit once, they have a full year to send in their app after their PP is
      accepted, etc.)</p>
    <p><b>Read the call for proposals (solicitation)</b>
      <br>After a brief pause, new Phase I SBIR and STTR solicitations are expected in the weeks following the Dec. 3
      closing date. You can check out our last <a href="{{ site.data.solicitations['SBIR'].url }}" target="_blank">SBIR
        solicitation</a> or <a href="{{ site.data.solicitations['STTR'].url }}" target="_blank">STTR solicitation</a> to
      get a sense of NSF’s objectives.
    </p>
    <p><b>Register your company (FREE and required)</b>
      <br>If your company hasn’t worked with the government before, you’ll need to register with these systems. You MUST
      have completed your SAM registration BEFORE you can begin entering your proposal in FastLane. Start as soon as
      possible!

              <p>A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company.
                You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for
                government funding, processing time should take about five business days.</p>

              <p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to three weeks</p>
              <p>You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through System for Award Management (SAM).
                When you register, you’ll have to share bank account information of the account where the NSF funds
                would be deposited. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can
                take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane
                account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year.</p>

              <p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to 48 hours</p>
              <p>Before applying, you need to register your company with NSF in Research.gov. Only after registering
                with Research.gov can you login to <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">FastLane</a>
                and begin preparing your proposal. (SBIR and STTR proposals are not accepted in Research.gov). We
                recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.</p>

              <p>Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business
                Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll
                need to include in your FastLane application.</p>
