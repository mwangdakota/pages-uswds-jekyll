# Required Registrations

## Register your company (FREE and required)
If your company hasn’t worked with the government before, you’ll need to register with these. Every step in the process, including all of these registrations, is free. 

You **must** have completed your SAM registration **before** you can begin entering your proposal in Research.gov. We recommend completing the steps in this order and starting as soon as possible!
**1. [Register in SAM.gov for a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/how-to-submit/unique-identity-id/)**
**2. [Register in Research.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/how-to-submit/research/)** 
**3. [Complete the SBIR Company Registry]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/how-to-submit/sba-company-registry/)**
