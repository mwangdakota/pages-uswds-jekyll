# Required Registrations

 [NSF Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page) 
  
  Organizations new to NSF must register via the account management system in <a href="https://www.research.gov" target="_blank">Research.gov</a>.

  For additional information and step-by-step instructions, please see the ["Register a New Organization" guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf#page=13) and [Account Management Guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf) section. 

  The [Account Management Guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf), [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_FAQs.pdf), and multiple video tutorials are available on the Research.gov [About Account Management](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_node_display&_nodePath=/researchGov/Service/Desktop/InstitutionAndUserManagement.html) page.

  NSF recommends that the Principal Investigator (PI) also register as an “Authorized Organizational Representative – AOR” for the organization. The PI creates and uploads all proposal components to Research.gov, and the AOR formally submits the proposal to NSF. <span style="color:red;">Only PIs with AOR privileges can submit the proposal.</span> The AOR role is NEVER assigned to any person by default. 

  You can request the AOR role via the "Add a New Role" page in [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov). Here's how: 
  * Sign in to [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov) and select the "My Profile" link located at the top right of the screen.
  * To add the AOR role, select the "Add Organizational Role" button and choose the AOR role. Complete the role request wizard four-step process. Please see the [Account Management Guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf) "Add a New Role" section for additional information and step-by-step instructions with associated screenshots.
