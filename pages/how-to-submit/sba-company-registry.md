# SBA Company Registry

## Register your company (FREE and required)

You need to register with the [SBIR Company Registry](https://www.sbir.gov/registration) (operated by the Small Business Administration).

Company registration is meant for small businesses to register and gain access to the SBIR.gov system. Completed registrations will receive a unique SBC Control ID to be used for submissions at any of the other federal agencies with SBIR or STTR programs.
