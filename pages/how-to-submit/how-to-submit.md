# Overview

Use this guide to help you submit a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I or Phase II proposal in Research.gov. 

New in November 2022, NSF will only accept full proposals from startups and small businesses via Research.gov, a new proposal submission portal that allows applicants to create, submit, track and update full proposals.  (The system and process used to submit Project Pitches has not changed.)

Access [Research.gov](https://identity.research.gov/sso/UI/Login?realm=%2Fresearch&goto=https%3A%2F%2Fidentity.research.gov%3A443%2Fsso%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dtoken%26scope%3Dprofile%26client_id%3Dpsm.prod.oauth%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.research.gov%252Fproposalprep%252Fiam%252Fauth-response.html) to submit a full Phase I or Phase II SBIR/STTR proposal. Visit the [Research.gov About Page](https://www.research.gov/research-web/content/aboutpsm) to help you prepare and submit your proposal.

## Research.gov help desk
Please contact the Research.gov Help Desk (1-800-381-1532 or [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) ) for IT system or accessibility-related questions (7:00 AM – 9:00 PM Eastern Time; Monday – Friday except federal holidays). 

## Before you submit

### Were you invited to submit a proposal?

NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I applicants are REQUIRED to submit a “Project Pitch” that outlines the project objectives, technical innovation and associated technical risks. Projects that seem to be a good fit will be officially INVITED to submit a full proposal. 

Only invited SBIR/STTR proposals will be reviewed by NSF. To learn more about the Project Pitch, please visit [How It Works]({{ site.baseurl }}/apply/get-started/). 

### Applying for Phase II?

Only NSF Phase I SBIR/STTR awardees are permitted to submit a Phase II proposal.  

We encourage you to follow guidance from your program director about when and how to submit your Phase II proposal. 

## Preparing your proposal

### Read the SBIR/STTR Solicitations 
The Phase I and Phase II SBIR/STTR Solicitations explain the content needed in your proposal. We also encourage you to join an [upcoming webinar]({{ site.baseurl  }}/events/) to help you prepare your proposal or to reach out to the relevant [SBIR/STTR program director]({{ site.baseurl  }}/contact/) if you have questions about the proposal and review process. 
### Proposal content questions  
SBIR and STTR program-related questions should be directed to sbir@nsf.gov.
