# Overview

Use this guide to help you submit a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I or Phase II proposal in Research.gov. 

New in November 2022, NSF will only accept full proposals from startups and small businesses via Research.gov, a new proposal submission portal that allows applicants to create, submit, track and update full proposals.  (The system and process used to submit Project Pitches has not changed.)

Access [Research.gov](https://identity.research.gov/sso/UI/Login?realm=%2Fresearch&goto=https%3A%2F%2Fidentity.research.gov%3A443%2Fsso%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dtoken%26scope%3Dprofile%26client_id%3Dpsm.prod.oauth%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.research.gov%252Fproposalprep%252Fiam%252Fauth-response.html) to submit a full Phase I or Phase II SBIR/STTR proposal. Visit the [Research.gov About Page](https://www.research.gov/research-web/content/aboutpsm) to help you prepare and submit your proposal. 

## Research.gov help desk
Please contact the Research.gov Help Desk (1-800-381-1532 or [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) ) for IT system or accessibility-related questions (7:00 AM – 9:00 PM Eastern Time; Monday – Friday except federal holidays). 

## Before you submit

### Were you invited to submit a proposal?

NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I applicants are REQUIRED to submit a “Project Pitch” that outlines the project objectives, technical innovation and associated technical risks. Projects that seem to be a good fit will be officially INVITED to submit a full proposal. 

Only invited SBIR/STTR proposals will be reviewed by NSF. To learn more about the Project Pitch, please visit [How It Works]({{ site.baseurl }}/apply/get-started/). 

### Applying for Phase II?

Only NSF Phase I SBIR/STTR awardees are permitted to submit a Phase II proposal.  

We encourage you to follow guidance from your program director about when and how to submit your Phase II proposal. 

## Preparing your proposal

### Read the SBIR/STTR Solicitation 
The Phase I and Phase II SBIR/STTR Solicitations explains the content needed in your proposal. We also encourage you to join an upcoming webinar to help you prepare your proposal or to reach out to the relevant SBIR/STTR program director if you have questions about the Phase I proposal and review process. 
### Proposal content questions  
SBIR and STTR program-related questions should be directed to sbir@nsf.gov. 

## Registration

### Do you have the required registrations?

- [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://www.sam.gov/SAM/)
  Please allow sufficient time for a new SAM registration to be processed and active. New SAM registrations can take up to one month to become active. Sometimes SAM registrations can take longer if the registration information provided in SAM is incomplete or accurate.
  
  NOTE: Once your new SAM registration is active, it takes up to two business days for NSF to receive and process your SAM information. New organizations cannot register with NSF until the organization’s active SAM registration information is processed by NSF.
  
  The SAM registration information must be validated with outside parties before the registration can be activated. If the registration fails the Internal Revenue Service Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) validation or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) validation with the Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency, the SAM registration could take significantly longer to become active.
  
  When entering the organization’s TIN in SAM, ensure that the organization name matches the taxpayer name associated with your TIN. A mismatch of information can result in significant SAM registration activation delays.
  
  Any subrecipient(s) named in a proposal is also required to obtain a SAM.gov-issued Unique Entity ID (UEI) and register the organization with NSF. Subrecipient(s) named in the proposal, however, do not need to go through the full UEI registration in SAM.gov. Refer to the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter I.G.2. Details are as follows:     
  
  Step 1: Subrecipient must obtain a UEI:
  
  A subrecipient without a UEI must go to [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/content/home) and select the green Get Started button on the "Register Your Entity or Get a Unique Entity ID" section in the upper right side of the page. Please note, the information required for obtaining a UEI is minimal (organization's legal business name and address) and will be processed relatively quickly. Once the subrecipient obtains the UEI through [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/content/home), the subrecipient must contact the NSF Help Desk at 1-800-381-1532 (7:00 AM - 9:00 PM ET; Monday - Friday except federal holidays) to register the organization with NSF.  
  
  Step 2: Subrecipient(s) must register their organization with NSF:
  
  When the subrecipient(s) contacts the NSF Help Desk, inform the technician that this is an SBIR or STTR proposal requiring subrecipient organization registration. Please do not attempt to register the subrecipient organization with NSF in Research.gov because the system will generate an error and will not permit the subrecipient registration. To expediate the process, subrecipients should provide the following information for each unique subrecipient organization on the proposal:    
    - Subrecipient UEI: Required
    - Subrecipient Organization Name: Required
    - Subrecipient Complete Address (Including City, State, and Zip): Required
    - Subrecipient Phone Number: Optional
    - Subrecipient POC: Optional
    - Email of Subrecipient Organization: Optional   

Once these two steps are complete, the subrecipient organization may be added to the proposal with the UEI.

- [Small Business Administration (SBA) Company Registry](https://www.sbir.gov/registration)
  
  You need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration).

- [NSF Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page)
  
  Organizations new to NSF, other than subrecipient organizations, must register via the account management system in [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/).

  The [Account Management Guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf), [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_FAQs.pdf), and multiple video tutorials are available on the Research.gov [About Account Management](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_node_display&_nodePath=/researchGov/Service/Desktop/InstitutionAndUserManagement.html) page.
  
  NSF recommends that the Principal Investigator (PI) also registers as an “Authorized Organizational Representative – AOR” for the organization. The PI creates and uploads all proposal components to Research.gov, and the AOR formally submits the proposal to NSF. <span style="color:red;">Only PIs with AOR privileges can submit the proposal</span>. The AOR role is NEVER assigned to any person by default.
  
  You can request the AOR role via the “Add a New Role” page in [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/). Here’s how:
  
    - Sign in to [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/) and select the “My Profile” link located at the top right of the screen. 
    - Select the "Add a New Role" link in the left navigation bar.
    - To add the AOR role, select the “Add Organizational Role” button and choose the AOR role. Complete the role request wizard four-step process. Please see the [Account Management Guide](https://www.research.gov/common/attachment/Desktop/Single_ID_Help.pdf) “Add a New Role” section for additional information and step-by-step instructions with associated screenshots.
 
### Register a New Organization

Organizations must be registered with NSF to submit proposals using NSF’s systems. Before a new organization can register with NSF, it must first be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM - [https://www.sam.gov](https://www.sam.gov/)) Note that completion of the SAM registration process can take up to one month.

Follow the step-by-step process below to register a new organization in Research.gov.

**How do I register a new organization with NSF?**

-	Open [Research.gov](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page)
-	Click “Sign In” located at the top right of the screen.
-	Enter your NSF ID and password and click “Sign In.”
-	Click “My Profile” located at the top right of the screen.
-	Click “Add a New Role” from the left navigation bar.
-	Click “Add Organizational Role” located in the “Add and Manage Organizations” box.
    -	Note: If an organization is new to NSF, you must start the process by setting yourself up as the Administrator for the new organization. You must have an NSF account to start this process. The system will automatically detect that the organization is new and will walk you through setting up the organization and Administrator role.

-	If your organization is not already registered with NSF, a message will display to confirm that the organization is not found in NSF systems and you will be able to register the organization and become the first Administrator.

**Helpful Tip:** If a new organization is registered with NSF without an Administrator, the first user to request a role will become the organization’s first Administrator.

-	Enter your contact information for the Administrator role, add your organization’s information, and then click “Next.” (Figure 3)
-	Notice the “Administrator” role is pre-selected. Click “Next.” (Figure 4)
-	Review your organization’s information for accuracy and click “Submit.” (Figure 5)
-	The request to register your organization with NSF will be forwarded via email to your organization’s SAM points of contact for their information only. The SAM points of contact will **not** need to approve the request. (Figure 6)

<span style="color:red;">It is recommended that the Principal Investigator (PI) also registers as an “Authorized Organizational Representative – AOR” for the organization. The PI creates and uploads all proposal components to Research.gov and the AOR formally submits the proposal to NSF. Only PIs with AOR privileges can submit the proposal. Failing to register as an AOR is not a valid excuse for missing the solicitation deadline.</span>
