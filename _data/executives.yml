Barry brings a wealth of experience in industry and startups and has a long history of building public and private partnerships. For example, in 2001, he co-founded the biometric security company Privaris, Inc., where he served as chairman of the board of directors and, for nearly four years, president and chief executive officer. In 2014, Privaris’s patent portfolio was acquired by Apple, Inc. Johnson was also the founding president and executive director of the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing, an applied research center and not-for-profit public-private partnership comprising industry, academia, and government. He has been a consultant to more than a dozen companies and federal agencies. Barry also has significant government and academic experience. From March 2015 to January 2019, he served as the division director for the then-Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships within the NSF’s Directorate for Engineering. During that time, he spent nearly a year as acting assistant director for Engineering, receiving the NSF Distinguished Service Award. He was instrumental in the creation of the NSF INTERN program, among other accomplishments. Barry is the L. A. Lacy Distinguished Professor of Engineering at UVA’s Charles L. Brown Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Director of the Computer Engineering Program. He served as an inaugural co-PI for the Engineering Research Visioning Alliance, or ERVA, a partnership that convenes, catalyzes, and empowers the engineering community to identify future engineering research directions. Barry earned his Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia. He has published more than 150 technical articles, written several books, and is an inventor on more than 40 issued patents. Barry is a Class of 2016 National Academy of Inventors Fellow and is also a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers."
