    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make laparoscopic and robotic assisted abdominal surgery safer for patients, and less costly for the healthcare system.  Though a somewhat rare complication, inadvertent bowel injury during the more than 15 million laparoscopic procedures performed annually can be catastrophic for patients resulting in extended hospitalization, multiple corrective surgeries, lifelong medical complications, and, in more than 5% of cases, death.  In addition, the direct costs associated with this complication can be substantial including intensive care convalescence and the potential for litigation given the nature of damages suffered by patients. Intraoperative detection of bowel injuries during surgery provides a simple, yet elegant solution enabling immediate repair and avoidance of negative outcomes. This project’s commercial potential includes availability in more than 49,000 operating suites and an addressable market of $750 million per annum. The proposed innovation will significantly enhance patient safety, reduce costs associated of corrective care, and generate revenue from U.S. based manufacturing.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable intraoperative detection of bowel injuries by identifying gases typically sequestered to the interior of the gastrointestinal tract. To accomplish this, these target gases must be sufficiently differentiable from background gases and other agents typically present during laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Such background agents present a meaningful technical challenge in that they present the potential for false positive detection results. Characterization of all potentially present agents will be completed such that they can be sufficiently differentiated from target gastrointestinal gases. A high precision gas chromatography system and custom fabricated chamber replicating surgical conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity and gas flow rate will be used to precisely identify and distinguish all potentially present gases. Once all potentially cross-reactive gases are characterized, a combination of physical filtration and algorithmic signal processing will be used to ensure proper differentiation/recognition of gas species and avoidance of potential false positive results.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital imaging in dentistry.\
    \ The goal is to create an imaging device to assist dentists when they assess\
    \ gingival health. This project uses ultrasound in contrast to the X-rays typically\
    \ used in dental imaging. The project impact will be a decreased overall radiation\
    \ dose to both patients and oral health professionals as well as high-resolution\
    \ imaging details on the soft tissue (gums). Details on the gingiva is often difficult\
    \ or impossible to obtain with X-ray imaging. The impact of commercialization\
    \ will include improved patient satisfaction as well as faster and better treatment\
    \ outcomes. Oral health professionals will be able to treat more patients per\
    \ unit time. This ultrasound-based approach will also offer early detection of\
    \ periodontitis to reduce the high cost of treatment associated with advanced\
    \ periodontal disease.  This device will reduce the risk of advanced periodontitis\
    \ and tooth loss and thus improve patient quality of life. Other broader impacts\
    \ include new insights into miniaturizing imaging equipment and processing imaging\
    \ data: These insights will improve acoustic imaging in areas well beyond the\
    \ mouth. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project offers\
    \ creative ideas to improve oral healthcare. The gold standard in dentistry is\
    \ physical inspection and X-ray imaging. This project will take advances in ultrasound\
    \ and integrate them into oral health. Ultrasound is ideally suited to image the\
    \ gingiva where gum disease resides and leads to tooth loss. The first objective\
    \ of the project will use creative strategies to miniaturize the size of the imaging\
    \ equipment. This miniaturization is important in order to access all teeth in\
    \ the mouth—conventional ultrasound imaging equipment can only access the incisors\
    \ and canines. The second objective is the development of novel algorithms to\
    \ automate image collection and image analysis. The software resulting from this\
    \ project will document dental health and track it over time. The software will\
    \ give clinicians detailed information about teeth and gums for diagnosis, prognosis,\
    \ risk assessment, and treatment planning. The ultimate technical result will\
    \ be an integrated device for acoustic imaging of the entire mouth that automatically\
    \ processes the imaging data.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient’s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient’s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients’ mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project’s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project’s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence/machinge learning (AI/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient’s future cognitive function.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to facilitate the blue economy’s continued transition to a big-data paradigm. Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation. The project enables adaptability by using an advanced control model methodology which adjusts the device hardware based on ambient environmental conditions for optimized performance. Due to the deployment environment, this project will capture training data under a laboratory setting, train the control model offline, and apply it in the field by leveraging edge computing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is potential commercial development of superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits with the ability to enable true biological brain-inspired deep neural network circuit algorithms and to improve efficiency, speed, and scalability of NC by orders of magnitude. The knowledge and approaches developed through this effort may help advance the foundational development of next generation computing hardware, helping NC continue its advance toward broad market adoption, and helping the US maintain its position as a leader in processor development and production. Additionally, the integrated synthesis-characterization-application approach can be extended to a range of applications, including sensors, metamaterials, catalysis, and renewables, which require atomic-scale control of materials and interfaces. Finally, through a partnership with University of Kansas, the project will facilitate university technology transfer and will serve to educate the next generation of materials and advanced electronics scientists and engineers. The atomic-to-nanoscale design, fabrication, characterization, and application experience will not only assist in recruiting top-quality students and provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits consisting of atomically tunable memristors (synapses) with superconductor interconnects and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs, neurons). This superconducting NC circuit aims to enable true biological brain-inspired deep network circuit algorithms and to achieve currently unattainable levels of energy efficiency, switching speed, and scalability in NC.  The proposed research will design, fabricate, and characterize superconducting memristor-SQUID NC circuit hardware including development of the corresponding algorithms for pattern recognition, with machine learning capabilities, using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database to prove viability. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is illustrated in: (1) novel, atomically-tunable memristors with 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic range in the on/off ratio and switching frequency that can enable spikes of different amplitudes and frequencies as demanded for emerging deep circuits, (2) SQUID neurons with very high sensitivity and low noise, and (3) neurons and interconnects that can significantly reduce power consumption by eliminating the parasitic wire resistance that, in current NC circuits, increases substantially with circuit scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions in order to make infrastructure and operational decisions. This decision-making capability is important as many facilities spend millions of dollars each year on improving sewer system function, yet are constrained by lack of quality data on sewer flows. Improved sewer flow data may help to optimize infrastructure improvements and reduce costs to taxpayers. In addition, this work may directly advance the health and welfare of the American public through improved wastewater collection systems operations and reduced overflows and basement backups. This technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to advance a novel, non-contact sensor that collects video of wastewater flow in sanitary sewer systems to measure flow rate and detect critical sewer events. Specifically, the technology collects video of sanitary sewer flows and processes it in real time using a machine learning algorithm to measure the velocity and water level of the flow. This technology also evaluates images of sewer flows to identify illicit discharges into the system. Several key technical hurdles crucial to successful commercialization of this innovation will be addressed in the proposed project, including the use of artificial illumination systems in closed pipe environments, the development of strategies to account for rapid variations in flow rates, and the development of data analytic methods to identify critical sewer events. Given these technical hurdles, the objectives of this project will be to develop a video-based flow sensor that can accurately capture velocity and water level under expected environmental conditions and to analyze data from the proposed sensor to accurately identify critical sewer events such as blockages and illicit discharges.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a visuospatial educational assessment tool.  Visuospatial aptitude is a facet of intelligence that underlies innovative thinking, i.e., how do new ideas emerge? and What are the physiological processes involved? Today, there is an overwhelming exposure within society to digital visual stimuli and national assessment authorities acknowledge visuospatial abstract reasoning as an accepted and sought after cognitive ability. Future curriculum designs must develop along with how people are changing and perceiving knowledge. This project seeks to set standards in education on visuospatial ability by introducing a novel assessment. This visuospatial assessment tool will utilize a software platform that allows customers to take the assessment online, and has commercial potential to improve industry, science, and educational programs for the advancement of human communication.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the development of an information technology consisting of a visuospatial ability assessment for measuring the biological processes that are required for being creative. Humans are biologically predisposed both to perceive and to reproduce symmetry, mainly in visual form, but also aurally; This proposed visuospatial assessment tool measures some of the biological processes that are required for the perception and reproduction of symmetry. Specifically, this assessment measures a form of sensorimotor perceptual action referred to in this project as ‘affective symmetry gauging’ (ASG). ASG consists of a subject’s innate visual perception/identification of the division in extreme and mean ratio point (DEMR; i.e., the symmetry point) in a given pattern. Because this process measures the extent to which a subject can perceive/identify and reproduce the symmetry point in given patterns, the tool also suggests the degree to which a subject may be inclined to reproduce symmetry, marking this inclination as a natural human expression of creativity aligned to pleasingness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic. Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep, insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10 Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an innovation in sleep therapy.  Approximately half of all American adolescents and young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression, and suicide.  The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively advance teenagers’ circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities. This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better sleep hygiene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its ability to use machine learning and wearable technology to reduce uncontrolled destructive episodees, known as meltdowns, in children with autism. Meltdowns are highly distressing events for these children and their families and may require intervention on behalf of emergency response personnel and healthcare providers. Treating individuals with autism by proactively detecting meltdowns will allow caregivers time to intervene, mitigate, and prevent the onset of destructive behavioral episodes. The ability to predict a meltdown, and then implement strategic intervention to prevent the meltdown, may have positive life-changing effects for the children, their families, and their caretakes by reducing social stigma, enabling more mainstreaming of school and family activities, and reducing significant financial healthcare burdens. This technology may also be used to mitigate panic attacks in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a wearable device that detects, predicts, and helps prevent meltdowns in children with autism. Wearable devices that measure physiological parameters are available in the market, but none of them are specific to autism, and none of them proactively predict behavior episodes. A unique feature of this wearable device is that it uses machine learning to predict meltdowns. Incorporating machine learning allows each device to learn the unique biometric signature of the wearer so it can predict meltdowns with high accuracy. When a child is at high risk for a meltdown, the device will detect the relevant physiology and alert caregivers and therapists in time to intervene. The objectives of this project are to create a prototype which includes the wearable product and the individualization enabled by machine learning to correlate a child’s biometric measures with behavioral states. The goal is to achieve decreased frequency and/or severity of meltdowns. By enabling caregivers of children with autism to take control of and prevent meltdowns, this project has the potential to eliminate the stigma these children face during a meltdown in public, and empowers the children to become more independent as they age.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help hospitals improve their sterile processing departments (SPD), where decontamination, sterilization, and assembly of medical equipment and devices occur. The company’s proposed solution seeks to enhance SPD technicians’ work performance and skill levels, decrease SPDs’ operating costs, reduce Hospital Associated Infections (HAI) and Surgical Site Infections (SSI), lessen expensive surgical delays, and reduce related healthcare service delivery costs. Sterile processing technicians play a critical role in preventing infection by sterilizing, cleaning, processing, assembling, storing, and distributing medical supplies. They are directly responsible for disinfection and sterilization of hospital instruments/devices. The team uses mixed reality designed to augment the day-to-day work responsibilities of SPD technicians while supporting the cost-effectiveness of operating a SPD. The solution’s digital content and holograms provide an immersive experience increasing competency, maximizing workflow, and boosting productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project incorporates three applications into augmented reality hardware to enhance the job performance of sterile processing department (SPD) technicians. The applications include barcode/radio frequency identification (RFID) reading, traceability and surgical instrument detection, and inspection utilizing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).  These applications are designed to provide efficient and accurate tracking, improved workflow, and increased worker productivity. The research goals of the project include creating a software application programming interface (API) capable of reading barcodes and RFID tags. By providing additional monitoring and tracking capabilities with automated data within the users' field of view and creating an application to enhance object detection capabilities, SPDs in hospitals, doctors' offices and at-home care locations can learn, in real time, the best practices for sterilization of infected surfaces to enable safer and healthier living and work spaces.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to engage citizen in environmental research activities, potentially increasing the selection of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers for youth. This project focuses on enhancing academic and industry partnerships around citizen science, improving science and environmental literacy, and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields of study. In addition to improving the nation’s scientific and technical workforce pipeline, the project seeks to employ a unique commercialization model for interactive educational media that allows for both authentic learning and widespread use by general audiences. This model mixes digital and in-person experiences, digital distribution methods, and mobile experience commercialization strategies that can serve as a model for other educational and commercial interactive media companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two critical issues: engaging more youth in environmental science and engineering education and increasing local environmental data for scientists. The project team will research and develop optimal methods and tools for creating educational and interactive media with rapid scientific data collection capabilities. For youth and educators, the project seeks to engage users in national standards-aligned scientific learning activities. The project will create hyperlocal networks that collect data and make results directly available to local communities so that they can actively track pressing environmental concerns such as migrations and changes in populations of species. The technical goals of the project include creating new processes for connecting local, crowdsourced user input to citizen science data repositories in a way that automates the categorization and validation of that data. The resulting project will actively engage youth in real scientific research and improve data collection for federal and university environmental science programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides virtual interfaces that can be dynamically customized to address the challenge of user adoption in augmented reality (AR) products. This project overcomes previous limitations for AR such as the lack of interoperability, user-acceptance, scalability, and application-aware user intent recognition. While the AR market is projected to grow, wearable collaboration has unexplored potential. Users empowered by this project may be able to easily collaborate alongside skilled experts as well as robotic interfaces in the same medium. Through contextually-aware dynamic controls, manufacturing businesses can lower the risk of human-error while increasing fulfillment capabilities, as employees working from home can stay physically connected and remain engaged with minimal compromise. The AR innovation proposed in this project has application across multiple industries, including manufacturing, training, and emergency simulations.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create a framework for scalable experimentation of virtual interfaces that empower users to search, tag, and store meaningful data using gesture interactions in a secure and private manner. This project seeks to provide context-based, hands-free interaction with wireless devices while minimizing the need to set up sensors (such as optical components or microphones) in controlled environments and providing visual feedback and accessibility to the end user. A wrist-worn wearable captures pre-trained gesture data, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses identifies and analyzes an object within the context of said gestures to control a mechatronic device, such as a robot, to perform occupational tasks. This dynamic process uses factors such as the user’s gaze area, physical location, and computer application.  The improvement upon gesture control may allow a separate visual unit, such as the AR glasses, to wirelessly receive and display the gesture intents and perform contextually-aware, meaningful interactions with a clear distinction across a plurality of devices or digitally tagged objects associated with a specific use-case.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is not limited to the higher education community, but has broader application at the elementary, middle and high school levels, especially in underserved and marginalized communities experiencing increased rates of suicide and mental health issues. This project's innovative technologies can assist in the mental health crisis in the country's youth, and specifically in the Native American health system as well as Juvenile Detainee/Juvenile Justice systems. This project's implementation of research based on the benefits of game-based intervention coupled with biometric sensing has the potential to provide the technologies necessary to equip the mental health profession to develop options that could replace pharmacological interventions with a path to delivering personalized and measurement-based mental health services.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses predictive algorithms, wearable technology and peripheral autonomic biofeedback to provide timely and effective data to enable mental health professionals to enact treatments and therapeutic support for students. Challenges in the increase of adult mental illness, shortage of mental health professionals and shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists require a move towards tele-psychiatry, collaborative care and innovative technology to bridge the gap between inadequate supply and increasing demand. The proposed approach involves the development of bio-behavioral technology that provides mental health professionals an interactive stress and anxiety evaluation to enable deep, transformative connections between young adults and mental health service providers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a technology that delivers low cost of energy from offshore wind and unlocks new markets inaccessible to current technology, e.g., small populations with smaller, locally-maintained turbines, deep water locations where conventional floaters are not economical, and regions lacking deep ports. If successful, the global impact may have the potential to suppress carbon emissions at the scale of gigaton carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent/year. The proposed technology is a floating wind turbine that may reduce 80% of the weight of a conventional floating turbine and makes it possible to fabricate more components locally, with domestic businesses and jobs. The newly proposed architecture will be tested to ensure it survives and operates well in the ocean environment. The crucial first step is to adapt the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) world-class wind-wave software to simulate the unusual motions of the system and demonstrate its viability. The end goal is the commercialization of a disruptive offshore wind turbine, developed in the U.S. and deployed globally, that can outcompete all of today’s designs, in a market estimated to soon reach ~$100 billion/year.

    This project seeks provide the intellectual foundation that leads to a first-of-its-kind class of offshore wind turbines that have minimal weight, that rides on top of the waves, taht expands deployability into regions inaccessible with current technology, and that increases mobility for installation / maintenance. Such a floating structure has never before been designed and this project may provide deep insight into several questions about the loading and motions that arise from a complex superposition of turbulent wind, random waves, ocean current, rotor elasticity and angular momentum, and dynamic blade pitch and generator control. This STTR proposal seeks to address a critical technical risk: adaptation of NREL’s simulator OpenFAST to characterize the unique motions of the system operating in a complex environment of loading from wave, wind and current and the resulting impacts on loading and power production. The proposed system departs from long-standing industry conventions that have relied on the design principle of limiting system motions. The results of the simulator may be used to refine the system design and then demonstrate that it's dynamic behavior complies with the design load cases required for certification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the affordable and energy-efficient design of advanced powered lift aircraft, creating aircraft capable of transporting people and things to new locations. The reduction in transport cost and emissions made possible by this project may ensure that the advanced air mobility market, expected to grow to $120 Billion by 2030, develops community-compatible, economically- and socially-relevant mobility capabilities. The fundamental aerodynamic technology developed by this project may be applicable to a wide range of aircraft sizes and missions, enabling new capability in defense, public safety, and humanitarian roles as well as improving the quality of life for the public by enabling affordable, advanced mobility and logistics in urban, suburban, and underserved rural areas. The increased efficiency of the technology may enable these benefits to be realized while reducing the environmental impacts.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to confirm the feasibility of a new method of distributed electric propulsion for lift augmentation that combines high lift for low-speed performance with low drag, cruise-efficient wing design using a novel integrated propulsor. The project will explore the  complex and incompletely understood aerodynamic interaction of a propeller and wing, which is key to technical and commercial success. The technical objectives include: characterizing the slipstream influence on the wing pressure distribution and boundary layer characteristics, the influence of variations in propeller and wing configuration and location on high lift performance, and the aircraft level effects and tradeoffs of the configuration. The project seeks to meet these technical objectives with a combination of experimental wind tunnel research and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and analyses to thoroughly understand and characterize the complex flow physics and their impacts on aircraft performance and design. The effort may advance the propeller-wing interaction aerodynamics field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.

    The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber – designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.

    The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.

Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, “green”, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the productivity and safety of operations across the entire $1.3 trillion Blue Economy. Maritime operations routinely involve significant risks to human life and property and consequently bear extraordinarily high operating costs. Autonomous ocean vehicles (falling under the Robotics technology area) are being rapidly adopted by science, commercial, and defense organizations due to their potential to dramatically reduce cost and risk. The success of the proposed project will advance the state of the art for commercial autonomous vehicle compliance with international laws regulating interactions between maritime vessels at sea. Giving autonomous ocean vehicles the ability to interact with crewed vessels safely and predictably will accelerate the adoption of these tools and the missions they enable. Several specific market segments stand to benefit immediately from the proposed technology, including the $31B offshore wind market, the $2B port automation market, the $233B aquaculture market, and dozens of others. Beyond market impacts, humanity needs ocean data to understand the critical dangers of overfishing and climate change.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the design of systems and software needed for autonomous ocean vehicles to comply with the international collision regulations (COLREGS) for maritime vehicles. The difficulty the industry has faced in creating COLREGS compliant autonomy is the fact that the rules were developed with the expectation that experienced mariners would be able to make qualitative interpretations in unique situations. That led to a descriptive rather than prescriptive set of rules that is good for human mariners, but difficult to implement in software. The objectives of this Phase I project include the design and simulation of autonomous systems able to operate in compliance with the COLREGS. In addition to simulations, the software may be deployed to small autonomous surface vehicles for preliminary on-water testing. Anticipated results include a system able to maintain COLREGS compliance within a documented envelope of conditions. The effective implementation of safe system design, optimized control, and machine learning techniques can combine to produce the first autonomous ocean vehicles that can be trusted in congested waterway settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to produce a high performance, low power, electronic chemical sensor system that does not require a radioactive ionization source. Achieving a low cost, non-radioactive Internet of Things (IoT) systems for chemical sensing in a more distributed and connected network has potentially far reaching implications in many industries. Creating an IoT network of sensors to safely monitor chemical signatures on a large and distributed scale, in real-time, may provide new analytical-quality chemical sensing capabilities. Sensor applications may range from engineering (monitoring fermentations) and to health care (diagnostics), to environmental monitoring (air quality) and defense and security (hazard detection) or agriculture (waste mitigation). The chemical sampling and sensor platform has the potential to be integrated with cell phones and autonomous systems. The market for personal use devices could be substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to establish an experimental and theoretical framework to optimize Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) for analytical quality chemical identification. There are many types of chemical sensors that have been commercialized but no high-quality systems meet the performance, safety, and cost constraints required to be a successfully linked in an IoT system. The fundamental physics and commercial utility of DMS is well established, so it is a leading candidate for this use. The foundation of the system is a miniaturized DMS. Because the microchip operates on lithium ion polymer batteries, it has the potential for widely dispersed IoT-linked chemical sensing but the reliance on radioactive isotopes for chemical ionization is a critical barrier to adoption that limits commercial applications. This technical barrier may be overcome by combining a non-radioactive, plasma-based method of chemical ionization. The experimental results will be used to validate custom software to simulate performance of this complex system. If the performance of the combined system can be successfully modeled, it can be further miniaturized and optimized. The detection of natural gas odorants and selected food and flavor compounds have been selected as initial proof-of-concept commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to facilitate ocean data collection. Understanding the oceans is important for climate research, naval operations, maritime domain awareness, and ecosystem preservation, yet traditional data collection methods using research ships, commercial vessels, and buoys are cumbersome, expensive, and  limited in their scope of discovery. While satellites have enabled remote data collection, they are affected by weather and limited in the types of data they collect. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) - robotic boats - are promising, but even today’s smallest oceangoing USVs are too costly for many applications. Thus, many regions of Earth’s oceans are rarely studied. The technology developed here aims to meet this need by enabling low-cost deployment of sensor-equipped robotic fleets. Better access to ocean data may improve understanding of the ocean and its resources, leading to better climate modeling, improved safety, economic gains, and more effective regulations. Further, ocean monitoring and surveillance is key to understanding ocean water quality, identifying contaminants, and devising strategies to prevent future contamination and pollution of the ocean’s waters. Ultimately, cost-effective oceanic data collection may help sustain and grow the ocean economy.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a small, low-cost, autonomous robotic sailboat that uses an innovative sail arrangement and weather-optimized navigation system. With a combination of affordability and utility, the technology represents a new approach for widespread oceanic data collection. This technology can be deployed virtually anywhere in the ocean, can be small (2 meters or less), and is 100% wind- and solar-powered. The research in this project seeks to further this technology by advancing two innovations: passive directional stability and weather-optimized navigation. Unlike most other robotic sailboats, the proposed USV does not need active steering to hold a course, once set. Further, the proposed USV has a navigation system that exploits the spatial and temporal variance in the weather and uses local weather data to direct the boats to navigate more efficiently. This STTR proposal seeks to address areas of high technical risk including stability of the steering system under various wind and water conditions, resistance to traveling excessively downwind during storms, effectiveness of the optimized navigation system in both actual and simulated weather conditions at locations worldwide, construction and performance of prototypes in lakes and oceans, and long-term resistance to marine environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.  Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks to  disrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project is the creation of a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost, semi-automatic. ultra-high-altitude balloon system for suborbital transportation system. The technology seeks to provide routine sub-orbital atmospheric flights for environmental testing of payloads in the ultra-low vacuum of the Mesosphere (260,000 feet).  The technology also seeks to transport metrological payloads, such as radiosondes (that measures pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) and rawinsondes (that evaluate wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) at all altitudes from the ground to 260,000 feet for extended periods of time. This capability is especially critical for increasing the success rate of space missions. The new testing capability may save the space industry hundreds of million dollars in technology failures annually. The transportation of metrological payloads to the upper extremes of the atmosphere for extended periods of time may also provide improved accuracy of weather forecasts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to solve well-known problems that prevent balloons from taking payloads to the upper atmosphere. This project will develop hardware prototypes, perform software development, and integrate the hardware and software together.  The team will perform flight demonstrations to characterize the impact of the Mesospheric environment on the ballooning flight transport and demonstrate the low-cost payload transport to the Mesospheric sub-orbital altitudes for a long duration (> hour).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate the adoption of error correction technologies in the quantum computing industry.  It is widely held that quantum error correction will be critical to realize the potential of universal quantum computing.  An error-corrected quantum computer holds promise for making transformational discoveries in science and engineering that will have broad impact across traditional technology sectors. By developing resource-efficient quantum error correction design and decoding software tools, this Phase I project aims to hasten the era of error-corrected quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new method for error syndrome extraction from a register of data qubits during the execution of an error-corrected quantum algorithm. In contrast to the standard approach to syndrome extraction, where each quantum codeword is treated independently, this new approach extracts error information from the entire quantum computer collectively.  The algorithmic and cost advantage of the proposed approach is a reduction in the number of extra qubits required for error syndrome extraction. This project will focus on reducing the density of the quantum circuits used for syndrome extraction according to the new approach. Low-density quantum circuits are critical for robust quantum error correction since syndrome extraction is mediated by two-qubit entangling gates, which often have error rates higher than idling or memory errors occurring in the data qubits. Another objective of this Phase I project is to design low-density error correcting codes that promote locality in syndrome extraction. Local syndrome extraction is important for error correction in quantum processors that support limited connectivity between qubits. A final objective is to benchmark the proposed constructions and algorithms on simulated data and perform proof-of-concept experimental validation on cloud-based quantum computers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, which affects about one in eight men and is the second deadliest cancer among men. The current process for diagnosing prostate cancer is imprecise and commonly involves multiple rounds of increasingly invasive, uncomfortable, and expensive diagnostic tests. The medical technology proposed in this project will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging tests (MRIs) performed to confirm diagnosis, and enable improved ongoing monitoring of suspected or recovered prostate cancer patients. The proposed device will help hospitals save valuable time and decrease overall costs of care. The device will be designed to address the specific needs of clinicians to accurately diagnose prostate cancer cases at an earlier point in the diagnostic workflow, at a lower cost to health systems. Additionally, the technology will be developed with a focus on cost effectiveness, to ensure increased prostate cancer diagnostic capabilities are accessible even in low-resource settings, such as rural communities and low- and middle-income countries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a prototype of a new medical device that uses photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and novel acoustic lens technology to aid in detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Existing early testing options, such as digital rectal exams, prostate-specific antigen tests, and transrectal ultrasounds, are often inconclusive. The PAI endoscopic probe device proposed in this project will offer hospitals and clinicians a new method for visualizing potentially cancerous prostate tissues, with higher imaging contrast and resolution than existing diagnostics. It will also offer an alternative to other testing methods with known deficiencies that often result in misdiagnosis or missed cases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a biosensing technology that may enable highly sensitive, quantitative, point-of-care diagnostics. Once validated, the proposed biosensor, disposable sensor chips/cartridges, and electronic readout modules can be readily mass-produced using existing medical device manufacturing capacities. The technology may have an impact on the health and welfare of patients. The immediate goal is to examine interleukin protein monitoring for early detection of cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening health complication that develops in patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment, organ transplant, infectious disease, sepsis, etc. Additional applications include early detection of cancers or cancer recurrence, dry eye disease, existing and emerging infectious disease, biothreats, etc.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a proof-of-concept demonstration of a low-cost, magnetic biosensor technology that may enable analytical laboratory capabilities for reliable biomarker detection and quantitation at the point of care. The proposed biosensor will be adapted for quantitative detection of interleukin proteins in blood for early diagnostics of cytokine release syndrome. The technology integrates magnetic sensing into the ubiquitous lateral flow assay (LFA) format (used in pregnancy tests) utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as reporters of biomolecular interactions. The tests are well-suited for point-of-care applications where rapid and convenient access to low-cost diagnostic tools helps improve patient care. The rationale for this project is that the proposed biosensors can provide clinically-relevant quantitative data rivaling those of state-of-the-art laboratories while preserving the advantages of LFA tests in terms of low cost and ease of use. The disposable chip with its clam-shell design builds upon the usual LFA cassette design. The disposable chip will be produced and assembled from low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and is expected to add only cents to the cost of an LFA test. A low-cost portable reader capable of ultrahigh sensitivity quantitative readings will be built from conventional off-the-shelve electronic components.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project on a handheld simultaneous translator advances the state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning acceleration. Beyond technical contributions, the novel translator will likely have a significant impact on a wide range of domains, such as military personnel deployed in foreign countries, businesspeople participating in multilingual meetings, medical service providers, law enforcement, customer support services, diplomats and political representatives, local governmental entities providing services to citizens in the preferred language, and international tourists. As such, the project will have broader impacts in increasing economic competitiveness, advancing health and welfare, and improving military capabilities of the United State. Furthermore, the project helps to enhance equity in education and STEM literacy by enabling better access to educational resources to people of diverse backgrounds, especially immigrants, women, and underrepresented minorities in some countries/regions, who were previously disadvantaged due to limited prior educational access or limited access to foreign language courses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the research and development of innovative algorithmic optimizations and a purpose-built translation device to enable fast, accurate and low-power inference for simultaneous translation. The overall approach is to exploit the unspoken but implied connections among language elements at various levels to guide the learning model. Specific techniques are investigated at the phoneme-level, work-level, and sentence-level. Collectively, these innovations aim to reduce the computation complexity of simultaneous translation by orders of magnitude while increasing translation accuracy. A systematic and comprehensive methodology is also being established that allows fast implementation of the inference hardware via high-level synthesis and reports detailed statistics on translation accuracy, latency, power, and area to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the research.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to promote increased recycling and to enable the upcycling of two of the most common polymers found in mixed waste streams: polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). While plastic recycling can assist in mitigating the vast and continuously growing volume of plastic waste, mixed plastic streams—notably those with PE and iPP—introduce many challenges.  These polymers are immiscible but of similar density, making them unsuitable for simple melt-blending yet difficult to separate. Although additives have been developed to overcome the immiscibility issue, these additives typically need to be added at high loadings and produce resins with poor mechanical properties. This project focuses on the development of advanced additives (compatibilizers) that can be introduced in low concentrations to produce PE/iPP resins with superior durability, ductility, and industrial utility that rivals or outperforms homopolymers. Such a technology has the potential to bring superior efficiency to the mixed recycling process, advancing the field toward a more circular plastics economy. By delivering high-value products from waste streams, widespread adoption of this technology would drive improvements in plastic waste collection, recycling, and re-manufacturing, supporting jobs in these and adjacent fields.

    This project involves the creation of non-reactive, multi-graft copolymers capable of supporting high-quality iPP/PE blends with superior tensile strength characteristics, impact resistance, and rigidity compared to current resins. The proposed approach leverages interlocked molecular entanglements and co-crystallization to provide stronger adhesion to iPP and PE. This technology seeks capability of up to 30% iPP contamination in PE using as little as 1 wt% additive to generate high-value blended materials. Phase I development will involve: 1) optimization of polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymer compatibilization additives, 2) scale-up of optimized polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymers, 3) testing of larger scale batches for end polymer qualities, and 4) testing of compatibilizers with combinations of different grades of actual post-consumer plastic waste. The technology may contribute to an enhanced understanding of how specific copolymer architectures influence compatibilization efficiency, while also meeting the need for technologies to support compatibilization of PE and iPP for blended recycling applications.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the foundation of a fractional-calculus-based computational platform for the simulation of multiscale and multiphysics systems. This Phase I effort will focus on developing modeling capabilities for nonlinear thermomechanical fatigue and damage behavior of ductile materials and will provide important insights on both feasibility and performance of the fractional calculus approach for a class of nonlinear problems that is not only of extreme importance for scientific and industrial applications but it is also a prototypical example of multiscale and multiphysics systems.
    By leveraging an advanced and generalized class of operators, namely the distributed and variable-order fractional operators, this project will develop fatigue and damage mechanics simulation software capable of continuum scale computational efficiency and microscale accuracy. The resulting formulation will offer an unprecedented combination of computational efficiency, a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, and a revolutionary adaptive mathematical structure that evolves in real-time based on the underlying physics controlling the deterioration and damage process.

    The overarching innovation at the basis of the M3SIM software products is a one-of-its-kind computational platform based on cutting-edge distributed-variable order (DVO) fractional calculus (FC). The unique nature of DVO operators allows the new platform to perform multiscale and multiphysics analyses of complex systems at a level of accuracy and efficiency that is unattainable with traditional methods. This new approach will have profound practical implications for predictive science because it will enable a novel concept of an adaptive computational platform whose structure evolves with the underlying physics without a priori and ad hoc decisions from the user.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major fundamental knowledge gaps underpinning the ability to create accurate flood maps. This proposal will advance new knowledge on the use of advanced analytics for the estimation of floods, thus transforming the tools available to respond and plan for flooding. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that building-scale flood detection will be achieved through a combination of existing sensors and advanced analytics. This SBIR project will research and develop data-driven flood maps to support targeted flood response and long-term infrastructure planning. Using advanced analytics, existing sensor data will be spatially distributed to create real-time flood maps. The method will be validated using a highly dense sensor network in the Great Lakes region. The technical results of this project will yield unprecedented insights and measurements of uncertainty related to flood estimation at urban scales. The resulting real-time flood maps will allow stormwater managers to stay ahead of resident complaints, while saving lives and property by sending their crews to the most important locations. Improved flood maps will also allow stormwater managers to maximize the impact of long-term infrastructure investments.

    The project's goal is to make all communities resilient to floods and climate change. To that end, this proposal will show how advanced analytics, driven by wireless sensing, will transform the ability of first responders to save lives, while helping stormwater managers maximize long-term infrastructure investments. The key innovation of this proposal is a data methodology, which will convert raw, spatially distributed sensor data into actionable, real-time flood maps. This data-driven technique will enable the first of its kind tool to detect floods at the scale of individual buildings, without requiring a sensor at every location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) “always-on” toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power “always-on” IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be transformational to multiple markets that require energy storage. High-energy densities will be enabled by the proposed advanced polymer separators. Potential customers for the new battery separator include battery manufacturers for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, space and military, small wearable devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), drones, consumer electronics, as well as automotive manufacturers in the mass mobility market. Adoption will be driven by the huge demand for electric vehicle batteries that are cheaper, lighter, safer and allow for longer drive ranges and reduced charge time. There are multiple ways in which consumers and society will benefit from the batteries enabled by this novel solid-state separator; from electric cars, to flying taxis; from more efficient energy storage grids to more reliable space vehicles; from lighter wearable devices to long lasting medical implants. In the long-term, the successful development of low-cost, fast-charging, high-density, long-life, and safe batteries enabled by the company’s new separator will reduce fossil fuel dependency and drive the electrification of the transportation sector and the transition towards greener energy solutions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an advanced polymer separator for novel hybrid solid/liquid battery cells which will dramatically improve performance of state-of-the-art solid-state batteries, enabling higher energy density, faster charging rate and enhanced safety over commercial Lithium-ion batteries. The new separator will be constructed from a novel polymer material whose feasibility has been validated at laboratory level. Stability tests showed higher conductivity and stability than currently available options. Compatibility with high-voltage cathodes was also demonstrated in preliminary studies. The goals of the project are (1) to develop a solid electrolyte which has an ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes that are currently used in the Li-ion batteries and (2) a scalable solid separator (using the above electrolyte) that is compatible with high-voltage cathodes (4 – 6 V). Main technical hurdles to overcome for successful commercialization are developing blade-cast-worthy slurries and scaling up the separator to a cell-size free-standing sheet. The former will be achieved by tuning the composition of the slurry to improve solubility; the latter will be achieved by improving the molecular weight of the polymer and blending and mixing it with ceramic oxide.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the global autonomous detection of surface deformation. Measuring Earth surface deformation is fundamental to detect and analyze surface and subsurface changes due to anthropogenic activity, with a myriad of industrial applications that includes the monitoring of oil and gas extraction fields and storage reservoirs, mining operations, carbon dioxide sequestration, and/or infrastructure integrity. Illustrating the economic and social impact of its uses, the market for analyzing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data is expected to double within 5 years. Beyond the dramatic economic growth of InSAR, its far-ranging applications have broad social and scientific impacts, in particular related to natural hazards and climate change.  Advances in InSAR processing and improved signal-to-noise ratios will translate into improved monitoring of earthquake activity, landslides, water supplies, deforestation, floods, ice sheets, etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at tackling the lack of automation in InSAR processing and improving detection thresholds in InSAR time series analysis. While the technique can potentially measure millimeter-scale changes in deformation over periods of days to years, atmospheric effects can wreak havoc on repeat-pass InSAR interpretation by introducing errors that may mask small surface deformations. These effects, which are fundamentally due to pressure, temperature and relative humidity variations in the troposphere, can lead to errors that are larger than most of the deformation signals of interest. Current algorithms are not suited for automated, large-scale monitoring without a priori data because they require time-consuming manual intervention, and the final product requires exhaustive expert interpretation. Through the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods this project aims at: (i) further automating and accelerating the processing of InSAR time series, via the automation of some key sections of the processing pipeline that still rely on extensive and costly human intervention; and (ii) developing a new methodology to generate InSAR time series, that is robust to noise and allows for a finer temporal and spatial resolution compared to the state-of-the-art.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the health and welfare of the American public. Obesity among American adults has risen from 12% in 1990 to over 40% today, leading to an estimated medical cost of $260 billion in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). According to the National Institute for Health (NIH), 70% of American adults were overweight or obese in 2014. In 2013, American adults were spending $60 billion annually on weight loss, according to US News & World Report. A 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine study showed that those who kept daily food journals lost twice as much weight as those who did not. However, existing diet tracking methods are often too time-consuming for maintaining long-term weight loss. A personalized artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot could make food logging fun and easy, benefitting millions of Americans who are trying to lose weight and furthering knowledge on spoken dialogue systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance knowledge in the field of spoken dialogue systems in several ways. First, the project establishes a new research area by noting that AI and spoken dialogue systems have yet to be applied to nutrition. Typically, conversational agents focus on factual question answering or tasks such as flight booking, but there is an opportunity to leverage big data for learning relationships between diet and health. Second, this project will develop a neural generative chatbot model with memory, demonstrating the benefit of personalized conversational interactions with intelligent agents that remember the history of conversations and personal details about the user. While manually writing chatbot responses ensures more control over the output, the drawback is that the responses are less interesting, diverse, and flexible. This work proposes generative Transformers in order to generate more realistic, human-like responses and knowledge graphs as a novel method for remembering the conversation and diet tracking history of each user for personalized feedback. Finally, this project proposes the application of causal inference, often used for medical diagnosis, to the new, challenging task of predicting which foods lead to outcomes such as gut symptoms, weight loss, or muscle building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an acceleration in how new materials are discovered, designed, and commercialized in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  One aim is to increase the use of renewable electricity in the chemical and energy industries.  A major hurdle is the lack of efficient electrocatalysts that enable renewable processes, such as green hydrogen production, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into carbon-neutral chemicals and fuels, or other processes that can broadly decarbonize various industries. Traditional discovery methods are slow and serial, which limits the development of novel, commercially viable electrochemical processes demanded by the climate crisis. This project will enable a more rapid and exhaustive search for electrocatalysts, resulting in a deeper understanding of the nature of catalysts, and facilitating the decarbonization of the chemicals and energy industries by displacing traditional fossil fuel-based processes with a transition to electrification which utilizes increasing levels of renewable energy. The proposed platform will expedite the discovery and development of enabling materials, which can be brought to market and deployed globally to enable more renewable chemical processes.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a generalizable platform that can rapidly search through vast materials spaces for higher performance electrocatalyst materials, displacing the current materials which are simply the best amongst the limited candidates tested to date. Using this project’s proprietary Megalibrary technology, which enables the rapid synthesis of libraries of tens of thousands of unique, well-defined, monodisperse, and complex metal nanoparticles in a single experiment, coupled with high-throughput screening technologies, it is possible to quickly probe hundreds of thousands of unique catalyst candidates to find electrocatalysts optimized for performance. To accomplish this goal, the project must adapt protocols to allow the synthesis of electrocatalyst Megalibraries on electrodes and enable electrocatalyst screening. Additionally, the approach requires robust and high-throughput screening methods that can site-specifically interrogate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst candidates. Using these two innovations, it will be possible to then demonstrate the power of the platform by searching the entirety of a three element platinium and materials (Pt-M1-M2) space for the best hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst on a per platinum-atom basis. This demonstration will solidify the ability to translate this platform to a much broader materials space and set of reactions, which can impact businesses and industries globally.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will provide the medical field with a broad response detector capable of pairing with cheaper disease diagnostic tools for improved healthcare.  Currently, there is not a commercially available broadband detector that can capture visible light and near infrared light.  The Phase I SBIR effort will lead to an advanced detector capable of spanning this light range and fulfilling this unmet need.  As a commercial product, this detector can be used in multiple commercial sectors including unmanned vehicles, the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.  For example, in the medical field the ideal light for tissue penetration is between visible and near infrared.  The detector developed in this project would permit optical scans of human bodies for disease diagnosis.  The optical scan will provide a cheaper and safer alternative in comparison to expensive MRI technology and high-energy sources, such as x-rays, that result in radiological exposure.  The size of the global medical imaging market is currently valued at $16 billion and the proposed work would help healthcare services in rural areas have access to optical diagnosing services.

    Semiconductor-based detectors are limited to absorbing photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the electronic band gap of the semiconductor.  As a result, there is not a commercially available detector that can span 400-2200nm with fast detection.  The expected outcome of this project is a single broadband detector, based off of the quantum spin Seebeck effect to generate a spin current, that can span 400-2200nm with a flat quantum efficiency and a high response time.  The quantum efficiency (QE) of the patent-protected detector is almost three orders of magnitude lower than semiconductor-based detectors and the largest portion of the project is devoted to improving the QE to commercial levels.  The project will accomplish the following goals: 1) prove the feasibility of increasing the quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, 2) make a readout circuit board, 3) show detector capabilities through building a benchtop-working prototype, and 4) design a compact prototype to be built during Phase II. As a commercial product, this detector can be used in unmanned vehicles, in the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF’s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.

    This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will help address the major concerns of climate change and sustainability of arable lands. The two common methods of weed control in the agricultural industry, herbicides and soil tillage, have a negative impact on the environment and soil sustainability. The health of the microbial environment in the soil is degraded by the use of herbicides and soil tillage. In addition, soil tillage exposes the organic matter in the soil to oxidation releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goal for reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate is to sequester the carbon in the soil and not release it. At this time, the only option for weed control of mid to late stage weeds without the use of herbicides or soil tillage is manual labor, which is more expensive. The successful development and testing of the precision weeder extraction tool will give the agricultural industry an automated and cost effective option for addressing weed control while helping to reduce the carbon emission from the soil and protect soil sustainability.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector extraction tool that can remove weeds without using chemicals or soil tillage. Advances in machine vision have made it possible to identify the individual plants in a field and determine which plant is the crop and which one is the weed. Presently, the two predominant methods used by automated weeders to kill the weeds is either by a targeted herbicide spray or soil tillage. Both of these methods negatively impact the environment and soil health. The proposed precision weeder will extract and dispose of the weeds without damage to the soil or environment. The economics of weeding will require the device to be simple, cost effective, reliable, and field hardened. Design and development of the extraction tool will use a new and novel method for removing the weeds with advances in design and actuation. The extraction tool will be tested in the field to determine its feasibility. Successful field trials will convince the customer and investor that this is a viable option for commercial automated weeding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is its innovative and potentially transformative contribution to assistive technologies for infants with motor impairment. In the United States, over 40,000 infants per year are born with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down syndrome, that often result in motor impairment. There is currently no device that provides independent movement to infants with motor limitations. Since children learn a great deal about their physical and social environments when they begin to crawl/walk, conditions that deny or delay independent movement can impact cognitive, language, and social development. A device that will let these infants move and explore at the same age as other children could mitigate these developmental delays and facilitate full integration into society.  Lifetime cost of healthcare for these children has been estimated at $250,000. Providing early independent movement could result in a potential $50,000 lifetime reduction in additional interventions such, as behavioral and occupational therapy, special education, and the need for healthcare and educational aides.  This amounts to over $200,000,000 in savings per year to the health and education systems.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need, expressed by parents and therapists, for a device that will allow infants with motor impairment to move independently at the same age as their typically developing peers. Currently, no such device is available.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is the development of a novel control method for a powered device that can be used by infants as young as 6 months old:  The device moves in the direction that the infant leans (as when reaching toward a toy or parent) while preventing collisions and falls.  Previous research has shown that infants as young as five months old can learn to use this control method to purposefully steer a powered device in all directions. The research objectives of this project are to build and validate a second-generation prototype that can be used by parents and clinicians outside of a research setting. Successful completion of these objectives will advance the device from a research testbed to a viable, if limited, prototype, enabling future work to evaluate the impact of the device on the development of cognitive, social, and communication skills for infants with disabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind’s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot’s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot’s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to enhance scientific and technological understanding in selective harvesting of high-value crops such as strawberry. The innovation proposed here will be a key component in creating a compact economically viable autonomous strawberry harvesting robot. The technology developed in this project will help address the farming labor shortage which is experienced by farmers more and more each year. Agricultural robotics market is estimated to be $11.9 billion by 2026. Providing autonomous harvesting robots will enable farmers to grow more crops with less business risks related to manual labor shortages and will ensure that US farmers remain competitive, while creating more skilled, highly paid jobs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop critical technologies for delicate selective harvesting of fragile crops such as strawberries at a competitive pace. Recent advancements in computer vision object detection and three-dimensional scene reconstruction will be used to create near real-time operational scenes. Those scenes will be used to detect ripe berries, create a movement path and navigate the fast and precise robot arm for harvesting the berries without damaging fruits while avoiding obstacles.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to introduce a cost-effective way of crop protection from fungal spoilage. Every year, 25% of the food produced by the world is wasted due to fungal infections and contamination of crops with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The combined social, environmental, and economic global annual cost of this food wastage is >$2T. The proposed innovation is centered on harnessing an untapped bacterium to bring a new line of affordable antifungals to a broad base of crop growers across the United States, which are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing preharvest postharvest treatment protocols. The products are quick and easy to manufacture without costly purification procedures. They should be safe for the environment and human health and have a defined mechanism of action. As a result, billions of dollars’ worth of crops, energy, and resources could be saved, leading to increased agricultural sustainability and economic competitiveness of the United States. It may also advance the health and welfare of the American public by enhancing food safety. Finally, it can pave the way for other innovations to combat fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation by developing the first product, safeguarding corn crops from fungal spoilage during both preharvest and postharvest. Corn is the most planted crop in the United States. Every year, the corn industry loses >$1B due to infection with a fungus (Aspergillus flavus), resulting in contamination of the crop with a carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. The critical technical objectives during the project period will be to (1) identify the functional components of the product and demonstrate their mode of action; (2) assess the amounts of those components that can be produced per unit mass of bacterial biomass, (3) determine an optimal formulation of the minimal viable product that can be most effective in preventing fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination in the corn crop, and (4) conduct an optimal toxicity profiling of the minimal viable product. Upon completion, the knowledge obtained will provide valuable insights for effective intellectual protection and regulatory strategy for the products from the technology and identify any potential challenges related to scalability, consistency, and product shelf-life, which will determine the costs and logistics for large-scale manufacturing of the products.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable discovery of needed T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapeutics for late-stage cancer patients who have limited treatment options. These immunotherapies work by leveraging T-cells engineered with TCRs that will identify and destroy cancer cells that naturally present a marker (antigen) specific to the cancer on their surface (e.g., cancer mutations). This project will develop a high-throughput platform capable of screening many thousands of TCRs against many thousands of antigens to identify clinically relevant TCRs. This project could impact society’s health by discovering TCRs that will serve as the basis for treatments against currently incurable cancers. The commercial impacts are potentially large. The total market size of T-cell therapeutics was $2.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $8.5 billion by 2027. The platform described by this proposal has the potential to discover many TCR based therapeutics, creating value for patient and society at large.

    The proposed project is to develop a platform for identifying clinically valuable TCRs. This platform could be critical for developing new immunotherapies against solid tumors and for understanding the biology that underlies TCR-antigen interaction. Screening thousands of TCRs for functional activation against thousands of antigens is challenging due to the difficulty of tracking interactions between hundreds of thousands of unique cells. The proposed platform and method links T-cell activation with phagocytosis using engineered T-macrophage and antigen presenting cell (APC) lines. T-macrophages engulf APCs as directed by TCR activation, capturing evidence of an interaction within the T-macrophage. The resulting interactions can be read from the T-macrophages via single-cell sequencing. The objective of this project is to produce large cell-based libraries for TCR and antigens and to identify interacting TCR-antigen pairs. The antigen library will include hundreds of clinically relevant cancer targets, such as KRAS and TP53. These results will demonstrate the feasibility of our platform.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the positive effect it will have in the classroom, and ultimately, on school dropouts. Dropouts face bleak economic futures, are more likely to commit a crime and be incarcerated, suffer poor health, and exact a financial toll on society. Since dropping out of school is a gradual process of a student becoming disengaged in the classroom, the proposed project will address school dropout at the most elemental level. At the end of this project, the development team will have an innovative, web-based game that will transform the classroom dynamic, in any school, and give teachers meaningful analytics so they can better meet their student’s needs, keep them engaged in the learning process, and reduce the number of kids dropping out of school. The innovative platform has the potential raise the learning opportunities for marginalized learners and stimulate positive societal change.


    The intellectual merit of this project is in the quantitative measurement and tracking of student engagement and production of a longitudinal analysis for each student, so teachers can track engagement throughout an entire quarter, semester, or year.  The solution will empower instructors to make more well-informed decisions for their classrooms. The research will focus on converting the original composite, laborious, pen, paper, and spreadsheet version of the tool into a web-based version that integrates with teacher lessons while accommodating diverse content areas and a multitude of teaching styles. As students interact with the web-based, gamified lesson delivery platform, they can earn or lose virtual dollars while learning valuable soft skills such as such as responsibility, critical thinking, and work ethics, including financial literacy skills such as online banking, investing, using credit, and budgeting. This project will harness the game platform quality to capture students' attention and generate motivation to invest time and energy into learning. In the process, the game will collect valuable learning metrics and provide reports and analytics for teachers so they can learn more about their students. The goal of the proposed project is to develop the minimum viable product and test pilot its efficacy.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in creating an independent. assistive Braille learning device for blind people. The ability to read Braille is highly correlated with improved independence and quality of life. An estimated 70% of the blind are unemployed yet, of that subpopulation that is Braille literate, only 10% are unemployed. There is a Braille literacy crisis - only 8.5% of the blind population in the US can read Braille today, compared to 50% in the 1960s. There are several factors theorized to contribute to increasing Braille illiteracy including: 1) a shortage of teachers qualified to teach Braille, 2) negative outlooks on the difficulty and cost of Braille learning, and 3) and difficulties integrating blind students into mainstream schools that don’t have the specialized resources for this population. The results of this project will assist students of all ages in learning how to read Braille, including secondary Braille learners who become blind later in life. Aiming at inhibiting the Braille literacy crisis, the technology enables the blind to be given the same opportunities as their sighted peers, including better chances at graduating from high school and college, obtaining employment, and having high independence levels.


    The intellectual merit of this project is in development of a wearable, computer vision-based, real-time Braille-to-speech learning device. While the primary mission of the project is to unlock the full potential of blind individuals through Braille literacy, the overall goal for the technology is to unlock the full potential of human touch with computer-assisted augmentation cues in response to intricate textural patterns. The proposed technology will detect such patterns in a contactless approach, preserving the integrity of the material, and provide auditory feedback in real-time to allow for mechanosensory-augmented feedback. This project focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of such an approach by: 1) determining if the device and interpreting algorithms can be made robust to environmental and user postural variations, 2) developing capabilities to perform well on textured and/or patterned surfaces, and 3) conducting usability testing to identify areas of the user experience that must be enhanced in the future to be viable in the market with two vital stakeholders - Braille tutors and Braille students. These goals, if completed successfully, will not only impact Braille learners but also open up other market applications for this technology such as manufacturing and medicine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a semiconductor laser technology based on laterally confined photonic crystal cavities. The proposed laser technology may ensure secure semiconductor and microelectronic supply chains within US for energy-efficient high-capacity data center link capabilities, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous driving/aerial vehicles, high performance communication and sensing systems, etc. The novel solution may accelerate technology development, address technical and market gaps, and foster entrepreneurship with important social impacts. The project will help prepare a diversified workforce skilled in semiconductor production, nanotechnology, photonics and optics, and advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize high speed photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSELs) with single-mode, high power output. PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve early detection and clinical management of bacteremia in patients suspected of bacterial sepsis. Over 250,000 patients die of sepsis each year in the U.S., which results in hospitalization costs exceeding $20 billion. A sepsis patient’s risk of death has been demonstrated to increase by 4-7% per hour, where timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is expected to improve patient survival. Unfortunately, the standard of care approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility requires overnight culturing that can take a day or more. Currently, broad spectrum antibiotics are administered within the first hour of treatment with the hope that the pathogen will be susceptible, while waiting for antibiotic susceptibility results. The growing landscape of antibiotic resistance severely undermines the efficacy of the standard approach, as many pathogens are increasingly resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This project seeks to advance development of a novel optical approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility results within 1 hour to support the use of appropriate antibiotics, which has significant potential to improve patient mortality outcomes and reduce hospitalization costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an optical technology for the rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility results from a blood sample for patients suspected of bacteremia. The product uses an assay for assessment of bacterial metabolism, where a blood specimen may be cultured with and without antibiotics to determine antibiotic susceptibility. Advancements in the assay and microfluidics enable delivery of antibiotic susceptibility results within one hour. This timeframe would enable clinicians to use antibiotics that are targeted to the patient’s specific bacterial pathogen significantly earlier, which is expected to improve patient outcomes. The goal of this project will be to rigorously demonstrate the proof-of-concept and reproducibility of the technology.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a highly effective and long-acting implantable contraceptive for the 61 million American women in their childbearing years (ages 15 to 44), 70% of whom are at risk for unintended pregnancies. Unintended pregnancies accounted for half of the total pregnancies in 2022, and over 60% of unplanned pregnancies end in abortion, with an estimated 45% of abortions being unsafe, resulting in 5-13% of all maternal fatalities. Today, an estimated 7.5 million women aged 15–49 receive a treatment or hormonal drug via long-term subcutaneous arm implants. Once they reach the end of their lifespan, these implants must be removed, and complications can quickly arise. Not only are these procedures expensive, but they leave behind heavy bruising and scarring and some instances even require an operation for removal. The proposed product is the world’s first biodegradable contraceptive-releasing implant. The technology combines  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved material with a generic drug already on the market. It uses novel manufacturing methods and biodegradable materials, eliminating the need for implant removal and enabling the proper timing and therapeutic dosage. This novel delivery drug technology can be applied to different drug treatments in a sustainable and affordable manner.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the future of long-acting reversible contraception by creating a biodegradable arm implant that delivers a consistent hormone dose and does not have to be surgically removed. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to characterize the drug delivery scaffold and demonstrate its utility. This project will de-risk the prototype to be used in Pre-Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) studies required by the FDA. The Phase I strategy will be two-fold: (1) de-risking operations by finalizing the prototype after evaluating the physical and chemical properties and (2) test the long-acting contraception implant prototype in a clinically relevant biological model to provide the necessary data for a successful IND launch. Progress of this project will provide a solid foundation for advancing the biodegradable contraception product toward commercial utility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterial into a commercial-ready product and address volumetric muscle loss injuries. In the context of defense medicine, severe muscle trauma often occurs in environments where external factors such as sterility are not well-controlled. This project is expected to demonstrate antimicrobial properties of this novel muscle-regenerating biomaterial to enable use in these environments. If successful, the broader societal and economic impacts of antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterials are staggering. Volumetric muscle loss affects tens of millions of victims each year. Sixty percent of patients are left untreated, 30% receive a muscle flap transplant, and 10% of injured limbs are amputated. Total average lifetime costs for amputation now total over $700,000. Improved clinical outcomes resulting from the implementation of this technology could lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings over the course of each recipient's lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates significant advances over the existing standard of care for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss, for which no treatment currently exists. The joint loss of cells and extracellular matrix creates an environment where muscle regeneration cannot occur, leading to muscle collapse and atrophy over time. This project effectively replaces the extracellular matrix lost in volumetric muscle loss and creates an environment where satellite cells may proliferate and differentiate into new muscle tissue. A technical concern raised by clinicians, especially those who work in austere environments in military medicine, is the risk of infection caused by implanting a foreign substance into a wound bed. To address this, Technical Objective 1 will focus on incorporating antibacterial agents to optimize the scaffold’s ability to promote muscle regeneration while also having an antibacterial effect. Structural and mechanical properties will be assessed, cellular viability ensured, muscle cell quality evaluated, and antibacterial properties measured. Technical Objective 2 aims to investigate these outcomes with a pilot porcine model of muscle trauma. It is anticipated that the proposed antimicrobial biomaterial will both combat the risk of infection and effectively regenerate functional muscle in traumatic muscle injuries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project pertains to the critical need for pharmacologic treatments in large populations that suffer from coronary artery disease and that are subjected to procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery. While effective in correcting the reduced flow of blood to the heart tissue, these interventions also cause tissue damage categorized as ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). A pharmacologic treatment is critically needed to address this residual injury that is a major cause of rehospitalization, prolonged hospital-stay, heart failure, and mortality. By deploying the proposed technology of heart-targeted vehicle for drug delivery, it will be possible to achieve effective cardioprotection, which will reduce patient distress and economic burden on the healthcare system for patients undergoing reperfusion procedures. This disruptive technology will impact myocardial reperfusion injury market worth $1.6 billion and influence the standard of care for over 1 million coronary artery disease patients that are treated by angioplasty or bypass surgery each year in the United States.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop Cardiotropic Atorvastatin Liposomes (CATLIP) to deliver cardioprotective benefits of atorvastatin to the heart, safely and effectively. The innovative CATLIP technology will deliver therapeutic amounts of atorvastatin to the heart tissue for treatment of IRI. Current methods of administration are inadequate in reaching the drug concentration needed for clinical efficacy. Serving a long-term goal of developing a myocardia-targeted treatment to mitigate IRI, the research objective of this proof-of-principle project is to attain effective delivery of atorvastatin in the heart tissue. CATLIP’s targeting approach is based on a small molecule targeting vector that selectively binds to the cardiomyosin exposed in the injured heart tissue. The research team will prepare and characterize liposomes loaded with atorvastatin and modified on the surface with the cardiotropic targeting vector. This preparation will be tested in an animal model of myocardial infraction to determine atorvastatin delivery in the heart tissue. Successful implementation of this project will create a proprietary product for treatment of IRI of the heart and demonstrate the potential of a targeting technology for application with other drugs for the same medical condition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to democratize participation in the expansive growth of blockchain-enabled financial markets that increasingly require the ability to read, analyze, or write smart contracts at scale. Enterprises that lack the programming capabilities to perform these tasks well will become increasingly disadvantaged as smart contracts continue to proliferate. Ranging from simple Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that convey ownership to complex, self-executing agreements that automate future payments, smart contracts are at the heart of the commercial utility and perceived value of a blockchain. Growing numbers of financial institutions are seeking to advance their Web3 capabilities, even at premium prices. As algorithmic trading has demonstrated, automating analysis and execution can provide enormous commercial upside, yet it also can result in large losses if designed improperly or left unchecked. Pioneering a solution that enables enterprises without advanced programmers to reap the benefits of analyzing and writing smart contracts while managing the associated risks requires deep technology— specifically a novel visual programming language designed to manage big-data sets involving millions of smart contracts on public blockchains using simple no-code commands.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to build a unique blockchain application interface that will enable users to scan and read smart contracts and immediately leverage the extracted data to design, build, and test trading algorithms that incorporate digital assets. This interface will ultimately enable users to analyze and write smart contracts at scale without the need to code. The project will set the foundation for the inexpensive development of Web3 capabilities by thousands of enterprises that do not have access to advanced programmers. The project will also produce a computerized tool that does the following two key tasks:  1. continuously scan publicly-accessible smart contracts in real time, and 2.  derive indicators from these scanned contracts that likely are meaningful, initially for the purposes of analyzing and trading financial assets. The blockchain application interface to be created will enable users without programming capabilities to automate trading using live smart contract data for the first time.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the performance and accountability of capital projects which have significant economic and social impact. Large capital projects, such as infrastructure and energy, have long-term benefits to economies, affect local communities, and have geopolitical implications. Projects in important sectors such as defense, science, and healthcare often suffer massive cost and time overruns, making efficient and verifiable project execution highly beneficial. These projects are very complex and challenging to manage; they require multiple internal stakeholders to work together and affect many external communities. The proposed solution is a platform that enables self-regulating project networks and integrates schedules, contracts, and information flow across companies. This platform will be based on distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, making them transparent, efficient, and secure. The proposed solution will create a new, reliable, measurable paradigm for capital projects and allow multiple companies to collaboratively plan and collectively build them. It will also aid regulatory oversight, and projects will include all stakeholders. The platform will be revolutionary for complex projects planning and building, significantly improving cost and schedule performance, and bringing greater accountability to the multi-trillion dollar capital project market.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform using blockchain technology that improves the performance and accountability of capital projects. The technology will enable significantly improved transparency, while making projects more cost and schedule efficient. The platform will result in more responsive and responsible symbiotic project ecosystems and advance the application of directed, acyclic, graph based distributed ledger technology to multi-party enterprise workflows. The collaborative governance platform will enable self-regulating project networks of authenticated stakeholders, utilizing a consensus-based single-source-of-truth, and automate contract execution and value exchange. The platform will synchronize schedules, contracts, and payments into one system with verifiable consensus across all participants. The technology will incentivize project performance by mitigating the effects of complexity and enable artificial intelligence and machine learning applications for projects by providing verifiable data. The focus will be on developing the architecture and business model of the platform.  The team will conduct market research to identify the primary commercial consumers and potential revenue streams. The project will build a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the platform. The anticipated results include a functional prototype of the platform and a validated business model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel product for ensuring proper visualization through intraoperative scopes during laparoscopic procedures. Worldwide, 13 million laparoscopic surgeries are performed each year. Surgeons require proper visualization of the operating site which entails continually wiping the lens, reinserting the scope, relocating the surgical site, and then resuming the surgery. This difficulty in visualization results in the need to temporarily halt the operation and potentially lose critical focus of the surgical area in order to restore the surgical field of view. Surgeons repeat this process an average of six times per hour, accounting for nearly 1/3 of the operating time. This time delay results in an estimated loss of 336,000 hours of operating room procedure time and $1.25 billion in productivity losses in the United States alone each year.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will develop operating prototypes of a novel, flexible, micro-mechanical mechanism with multiple degrees of freedom. The device integrates flexible and conforming mechanisms with a wiping blade to enable real time wiping of surgical scopes and ports. This technology enables surgeons to quickly and intraoperatively re-enable laparoscope vision within the patient. The technical challenges of the project include the development of a computational engineering model that optimizes user control of off-axis stiffness, force response, and stress.  The team will also need to ensure the solution has sufficient fatigue life and predictable mechanical response throughout the duration of the procedure. Computational engineering models will be used to design and develop several manufacturable prototypes, which will be tested and validated with several currently available laparoscopes.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its positive influence on both the growth of the Low Earth Orbit economy and stimulation of innovation in space technology. The growing demand for satellite launches is currently limited by a bottleneck of low availability, flexibility, and high cost of existing orbital launch services. Orbital delivery services enabled by this advanced in-flight separation system will enable a new level of launch responsiveness leading to lower costs, much greater contractual flexibility, and the availability of daily launches without the need for costly launch infrastructure, greatly accelerating time-to-market for satellite service providers and increasing their profitability. Low cost and frequent access to Low Earth Orbit will enable ubiquitous internet access, 5G capabilities, and valuable Earth observation technologies. The flexibility and reduced cost of these launch services will help maintain the United States' position at the forefront of space technology development and space research. The technology will provide the US Armed Forces access to a responsive, secure, flexible, and available gateway to space that will boost reconnaissance, observation, communication, and intelligence capabilities. Moreover, it will represent the most ecofriendly launch delivery service available, able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by three times (3x) compared to ground launch.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate an innovative concept of in-flight aircraft/rocket separation in which the rocket is launched from the top of the carrier aircraft, instead of the widely used launch from beneath. This new separation system is the core innovation enabling an advanced air-launched orbital delivery system that will dramatically reduce the cost of dedicated satellite launch, minimize propulsion and structural requirements, and enable orbital delivery flexibility and precision, while significantly reducing the carbon footprint of space launch operations. The proposed concept will be the first top-carry air-launch service commercially available. The goals of the Phase I project are focused on building a prototype of the separation system and validating it in a sub-orbital test flight. The main technical challenge is to ensure that the design of the improved separation system will work under a broad range of real flight conditions. This technology will be achieved by research leading to a better understanding of aerodynamic behavior at the separation event and the development of an improved design methodology that considers all relevant design parameters and their aerodynamic effects.

    \ across the dimensions of cost, energy use, time for degradation, or scalability.\
    \ An extreme example of the need for energy and time efficient depolymerization\
    \ of polymers is in space missions. There is a very high cost of disposing solids\
    \ in earth’s orbit and removing space-junk which must be monitored and avoided\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a new, non-rocket based thrust technology capable of removing debris from space. This project will provide two separate business models including hardware fabrication and testing, and active orbital debris removal services. Six Department of Defense (DoD) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO)SSO spacecraft have broken up in high-value low earth orbits since 2000, and the US Space Force tracks over 550 pieces of NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 debris objects (>10cm). This technology provides solutions to help remove such problematic debris from space. The technology will be designed for beneficial use by both US Government agencies and commercial space companies. The proposed vehicle fleet production is expected to enable efficient deorbit services for removal from space.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative method for Earth orbit transfer, called a Hyper Transfer Vehicle (HTV). HTV is a non-rocket technology that solves performance limitations of in-space rocket thrusters. HTV offers reusable and economically sustainable orbital space debris removal solutions across all earth operational orbits. This proposal addresses the space debris problem not caused by operational satellites, but from non-maneuverable objects and debris in the highly populated Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO). Historically, SSO space objects have contributed to technical, societal, and scientific advancements. The potential outcome of HTV research is a viable and reusable technology for cost-effective orbit object disposal in high value SSO with clean Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP). Instead of expelling propellant, HTV rotates a working fluid gas inside a toroidal cavity to generate a usable force. HTV torus structure draws in the gas while mounted inside an ambient pressure enclosure, which is separate from the vacuum of space. HTV generates a reactive force by employing the Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). CAM is preserved when HTV fluid angular momentum (H) and rotational energy (Trot) change. This project will demonstrate with experimental measurements an external force by using air as the working fluid gas, while satisfying CAM.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project entails the development of a simple and affordable saliva-based test that will enable the detection of early Alzheimer's disease. Today, there is no single test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Because the diagnosis is complex, invasive, and expensive, these tests are only performed once symptoms, such as memory loss, begin to manifest. These symptoms of Alzheimer's disease only become apparent once the disease has already cause significant damage to the brain. The proposed test will be widely accessible and detect the disease before symptoms arise, enabling the patient to start active prevention strategies and even therapies to preserve brain health. As the American population ages — nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 years of age or older by 2060 — Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are becoming a great challenge for health and social care. As part of a broad approach to prevention, this technology can potentially extend early Alzheimer’s care to millions of Americans, allowing interventions, monitoring, and treatment initiation years earlier than what is currently possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is applying sophisticated chemical analysis methods to develop a novel test to detect signs of early Alzheimer’s disease using a person’s saliva. Diseases can cause changes in the biochemical composition of body fluids such as blood or saliva. Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer’s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a lightweight, ultra-compact 3D sensor offering enhanced performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. Existing sensors on consumer electronic devices, such as those on augmented/virtual reality headsets, are limited in their perception accuracy and detection range resulting in a poor user experience, which has limited their implementation. The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities. This effort also supports domestic photonics manufacturing and assembly industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seeks to develop a novel 3D sensor design that promises performance enhancement over state-of-the-art devices. Building on a proprietary flat optics technology, the project may lead to a 3D sensor module featuring panoramic vision, significant spatial resolution improvements, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and a compact, lightweight architecture amenable to low-cost manufacturing and assembly. The project has two main goals: 1) demonstration of a 3D sensor prototype and experimental validation of its performance and 2) development of scalable manufacturing routes for fabrication of flat optics components leveraging standard microfabrication technologies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel medical device for intramuscular injections that will reduce needlestick injury. Unintended or accidental puncture is the second most common occupational hazard for healthcare staff. An estimated 385,000 needlestick injuries occur in the United States each year impacting 5.6 million healthcare workers. Needlestick injury represents one of the largest risks, both financially ($258 million annually) and medically (e.g., bloodborne pathogen exposure), to healthcare providers. This project aims to develop a novel, flexible hypodermic needle with a safety syringe that enables rapid injections while replacing sharp needles and significantly reducing risks of unintended health care provider injury.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a novel, flexible, polymer needle-based safety syringe for health care providers to perform intramuscular injections in patients. A novel and variable stiffness shaft is integrated with an external safety lumen mechanism to create an integrated delivery system with the same delivery reliability and repeatability as standard needlesticks. The design will be prototyped and evaluated under a variety of human factors considerations. The device will be required to pass several mechanical tests for puncture, insertion, and lumen integrity in a consistent manner, as anticipated during routine clinical use.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project includes reductions in food waste, energy use, and carbon emissions by developing a highly efficient and adaptable system for refrigerated transport. Mini-containers, which are small, insulated boxes with environments controlled by a central driving unit that contains a refrigerator and other environmental controls are proposed. The technology may increase the economic feasibility of small farms by allowing them to target a more resilient, efficient, and potentially carbon-neutral cold supply chain. The potential impact of the research includes improved availability of nutritious food for the general population and mitigation of negative environmental effects of cold logistics. Additionally, mitigating food waste will create savings up and down the supply chain.

    Two key technical challenges are addressed in this research. The first area has, as its main objective, the development of a volume-adaptable refrigeration system that allows for the efficient operation of several levels of control to best adapt to high levels of cooling capacity needs. The second area of research corresponds to the development of the methodology and solutions algorithms to exercise a hybrid control strategy for the optimal scheduling operation of the refrigeration system. The archetype refrigeration system would be subject to constraints imposed by the heterogeneous loads stored in the different special storage and transportation units known as mini-containers which receive cooling and other environmental services.  This technology will allow for efficiently aggregating, storing, disaggregating, and distributing fresh products in the mini-containers. The mini-containers will allow the emergence of efficient cold logistics for small loads by enabling the capacity of large transportation containers to be split among multiple conveyances. The proposed solution will also make it possible to convert almost any truck into a refrigerated truck and any warehouse into a cold storage facility, supporting the emergence of sharing economies in cold logistics.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the diagnosis, risk assessment,\
    \ and monitoring of cancer. Nearly 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer\
    \ in their lifetime. Diagnosis of cancer in later stages dramatically reduces\
    \ treatment options, leading to poor prognosis and low survival rates. In addition,\
    \ the average cost of treatment for late-stage patients can be 3–5 times higher\
    \ than that for early-stage patients due to the potential need for multiple rounds\
    \ of expensive therapies. These multiple rounds of treatment contribute to the\
    \ high economic burden of cancer. Thus, detecting cancer earlier will not only\
    \ lead to improved patient outcomes but will likely reduce the overall costs of\
    \ cancer treatment. Moreover, a minimally invasive and highly accurate diagnostic\
    \ could be broadly administered to effectively identify those with various cancers,\
    \ enhancing the commercial potential further. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation\
    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an advanced microfluidic system\
    \ for the isolation and assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC clusters\
    \ (CTCCs) for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Microfluidic devices in various\
    \ forms have been developed to isolate the extremely rare CTC population from\

    \ 1) low sample purity, 2) low numbers of isolated CTCs/CTCCs, and 3) CTC/CTCC\
    \ heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, this project will develop an innovative\
    \ device for the simultaneous isolation and assessment of single and clustered\
    \ CTCs and their molecular signatures, enabling the implementation of new, highly\
    \ sensitive and accurate liquid biopsies for cancer. The key objectives for this\

    \ isolation and concentration of CTCs and CTCCs with high purity, 2) Develop and\
    \ optimize two devices for single CTC and CTCC analysis, and 3) Testing and validation\
    \ using prostate cancer patient specimens. This research will lead to the development\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is found in its ability to provide a novel tool for clinicians for perioperative, post-surgical, and chronic pain management. This technology supports enhanced patient safety, international standards for enhanced recovery after surgery, reduced addiction potential and opioid sparing, reduced loading on clinicians and healthcare resources, reduced cost of healthcare services, and advanced capability of clinicians through training. The commercial impact exists in all facets of healthcare, including perioperative procedures, in-hospital step-down and recovery, ambulatory surgery center procedures, and chronic pain management. The potential exists to expand into other clinical markets including the military and first responders. This technology can support the national defense of the country by providing advanced care capability for wounded troops on the front lines, in recovery, and through rehabilitation. The solution also applies to use during times of national, state, and local crisis, and, as the hospital-at-home trend increases, that market can be pursued. Ultimately, the commercial impact exists in both worldwide use and in contributing to the overall projected increase in use of regional blocks in the coming decade.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project applies technology to a medical application that has not been addressed for over 130 years.  Based on clinical needs, a minimally viable device (MVP) has been developed and prototyped that objectively quantifies neural blockades. This project advances the capability of the MVP and advances information about the real-time in vivo status of a neural blockade. The goal is to assure device robustness under challenging clinical conditions, for different neural blockade types, and for physiologically diverse patient populations. The plan to reach these goals is to apply human factors and design engineering standards to the MVP to assure that: a) the user displays are readily understood, provide the expected information in an appropriate form and format, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; b) the user controls perform the required functions, are complete, reflect the appropriate nomenclature for the clinical environment, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; and c) the monitor is reliable, well fabricated, safe for the patient and user, and completely supports the acquisition, processing, display, and recording of pertinent data. The resulting technology will be a robust patient monitoring device that assures patient safety and optimized treatment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of the first all-in-one automated syphilis test available at the point-of-care. The number of syphilis cases in the United States have doubled in the past 5 years with a five-fold increase in congenital syphilis passed from a pregnant mother to the fetus. Annual infections now account for $170 million in lifetime medical costs. This low-cost, portable test will enable care providers and outreach efforts to immediately diagnose and treat patients in a single visit to halt the spread of syphilis infections in the most vulnerable populations. Syphilis testing in this platform will be readily combined with hybrid detection of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) to streamline syphilis testing with existing programs for HIV diagnosis and further encourage uptake of this test solution into clinical practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for easier syphilis testing solutions to provide comprehensive diagnosis on-site with the patient. Syphilis diagnosis relies on two separate antibody tests, of which one requires quantifying antibody levels with a tedious laboratory procedure called Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) to confirm if the patient has an active infection. The lack of resources and personnel to conduct RPR testing on-site severely limits the ability of public health clinics to effectively diagnosis syphilis in a timely manner. This project will combine both antibody tests including quantitative RPR into an automated cartridge for rapid and complete syphilis diagnosis at the point-of-care. The research proposed in this project will develop magnetic particle-enabled assays for each antibody test and integrate the assays into a multiplexed plastic cartridge. These cartridges, combined with a portable instrument, will enable all steps required for syphilis diagnosis to be completed within minutes in an affordable and easy-to-use format.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to empower the processors of harvested fruits and vegetables with the flexibility to use robotic automation to meet their labor needs. The automation uses collaborative robots (cobots) guided by computer vision, which are potentially safe around humans. The technology will help assure consistent produce quality and processing rates. Through a robust cobot-based solution, the project will provide an affordable, sustainable, and safe means for farms of all sizes to keep up with their production goals, which will sustain competition and the nation’s food supply. This project has the added benefit of upskilling workers in farms by creating openings for more technically oriented positions, both in monitoring and maintaining the cobots. Instead of tediously programming the cobot for each use, the project is introducing a new way of translating the tasks performed by humans to the cobot by learning from camera recordings. It will also improve understanding of how cobots can safely be used alongside humans in a shared working space.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project aims to make it possible to use cobots with human workers on tasks that go beyond the traditional pick-and-place. The proposed technology will automate processing line tasks that require computer vision, which is challenging because accurate and reliable perception must guide the robot’s motion. Research has coalesced the technical challenges on the path to a viable commercial product around five steps. These start with a formal description of the task domain followed by using robust implementations of noise-tolerant machine learning algorithms for automatically learning the task, and end with a solution that integrates the learned task behavior with a vision-guided cobot system. Phase 1 will support research toward addressing two problems. The first is to design an intuitive way to elicit a precise specification of the client’s task domain. A digital conversational assistant will utilize multiple modalities for the elicitation. The second is the inability of available implementations to generate coworker-aware and efficient cobot movements. The research will investigate and develop significant improvements to the cobot motion to improve coworker safety while reducing the processing time by an expected 50%.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel mixed-mode (wind, wave, current) ocean energy converter that aims to be an improvement over the state-of-the-art offshore wind turbine design. This project will clarify design specifications to target a low-cost product with production scalability. Markets with the largest opportunity to benefit from this solution include US grid power, remote US islands (Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, US Virgin Islands), other remote islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, and dispatchable power sources for emergency power generation like the Department of Defense. The environmental benefit of advancing the design of renewable energy converters and reducing the initial investments required by offshore clean energy may positively impact both the scope and the timeline for adoption of ocean renewables in the US.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an efficient energy converter that drastically lowers the cost per installed unit through reduced weight of product components, onshore assembly, simplified installation, a lower center of gravity, and by achieving a storm rating. When coupled with offshore energy storage, this technology has the potential to unlock energy capture in ocean sites further offshore than is presently feasible. This project builds upon initial concept modeling and a 1/20 scale prototype construction, which validates the weight/power ratio, device stability, and comprehensive analytical evidence for commercial feasibility. Keeping the final cost-to-kilowatt low, while optimizing the overall design will be the major technical focus of the work plan, along with mitigating strategies for the risk of severe weather survivability. The proposed research will approach the design of each component individually with a focus on reducing cost and weight, while optimizing strength and output. Through the construction and testing of a proposed prototype, the team will conduct detailed analyses on scalability, performance, and cost factors that are critical for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a commercial building management system that uses model predictive control for small to mid-sized commercial building owners to help them flexibly manage increasingly complex energy codes and prices. This technology uses machine learning to automate costly aspects of advanced building control, and eliminating complexity, frustration, and expense for leanly staffed building owners who are attempting to save money, meet code, reduce carbon footprint and adapt to rapidly changing energy prices. The proposed approach significantly reduces the setup time, the amount of training data, and the compute time needed for the technology to converge on accurate models and predictions using building thermal dynamics. These improvements reduce the controller costs without sacrificing accuracy. This technology will simplify the setup and implementation process for under-represented segments in the building automation, efficiency and model-based controls market starting with K-12 schools. This simplification has several distinct societal and environmental benefits including: increased energy and demand charge savings, increased energy efficiency, improved environmental footprint, increased job creation for building controls technicians, improved resiliency, and additional educational opportunities for K-12 families and communities.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology capable of building efficiency control.  The innovation employs a hybrid approach based on constrained deep learning tools that build on physical knowledge of building systems and architecture, thereby making use of sampling data while producing physics-consistent accuracy in modeling and control predictions. Specifically, the project team hopes to converge on an architecture that can more reliably and accurately manage energy use and occupant comfort compared to state of the art control approaches. The project team also aims to demonstrate a significant reduction in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)-driven peak system demand in target buildings while keeping instrumentation, labor, and data costs per building to an affordable cost for the target market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of technology that unlocks the use of abundantly available geothermal hot dry rock energy for reliable renewable energy. This technology will be economically feasible and provide an optional zero emission cogeneration configuration for harnessing cooling loop waste heat from zero emissions thermal electric power plants. The additional benefits, broader impacts, and market opportunity for cogeneration applications create an increase in power generation efficiency and capacity.  Increases in net zero emissions power will also be available at utility scale. This technology will reduce water use during wet cooling in power plants by replacing the iconic supplemental cooling towers for thermal electric power plants worldwide with cogeneration. Some larger and long-term societal impacts of this research include: a more stable power grid due to reliable geothermal renewable energy generation and a cleaner environment especially for populations living close to traditional power plants and industrial infrastructure. Global technology licensing applications include: grid flexing and resiliency, water desalination/filtration, green hydrogen production, and national security.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop software that uses computation, measurement, observations, and computer models, based on sound theory to find operational boundaries, validate key performance metrics, and optimize functional parameters for more efficient power production. This research includes the examination of critical technology functions and elements that determine peak operational efficiencies. The goal of this research will be to produce analytical computer models to look specifically at: 1) air intake velocity for a given set of pressure differentials, 2) air intake impedance, 3) thermal/pressure gradients generated by heat exchange activity, 4) air flow impedance generated by heat exchangers, and 5) expected exhaust air flow given idealized intake, heat exchange configurations, and designs. Anticipated results will provide quantifiable and measurable data tables including system sizing, energy input requirements, and mechanical and organic inlet air flow with emphasis on modeling of data analysis and determining specific energy inputs and power outputs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on improved methods for detecting and suppressing sea lampreys in the Great Lakes, a pest species that currently requires relentless, sustained, and costly control efforts at ecosystem scale. The project initiates the development of small, relocatable, field-deployed devices, capable of performing a range of assessment and selective control functions. Success in this effort will introduce an important new tool to bolster environmental health outcomes at an ecosystem level, and benefit commercial fisheries estimated at $7B annually. By replacing chemical and manual control of exotic invaders, the project contributes to the preservation of ecosystem integrity and function, biodiversity, and environmental quality of the Great Lakes, a vital natural resource providing water security for more than 35 million people in the region. With worldwide damage from aquatic invaders exceeding $300 billion annually, innovations driving advances in ecosystem protection and restoration will have wide appeal and application wherever habitats require protection. Broadening the available tool set empowers managers and local communities to act against exotic invaders at the level where causes and consequences are most acutely felt.


    This project performs a feasibility study of existing technologies from aquaculture workflows for adaptation to the uncrewed control of sea lampreys in the field. The essential features of such a device are inherently similar to recently emerged solutions for automated fish management in robotic aquaculture systems. Existing models for detection and classification are expected to transfer well to a class as morphologically distinct as lampreys. The primary challenges to this project most likely arise from the unique biology and sensory ecology of a species whose responses to the physical device used here are completely unknown. A set of artificial stream experiments aims to entrain lampreys into devices placed into their path. How might lamprey react to a device optimized for the specific needs of imaging, classification, and selective removal? Informed by detailed knowledge of lamprey chemosensory ecology, the work also examines the efficacy of pheromonal cues for channeling lamprey movement through the device.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving landfill diversion and recycling\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new generation of smart machines used in the measurement of parts and assemblies. The team has demonstrated that this technology can convert existing coordinate measuring machines to self-driving autonomous machines. The ability to automatically measure parts is an important feedback link in the process chain that will enable fully automated manufacturing of the future. Specifically, this automation will reduce the specialized skill required to use a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The innovation will enable workers to operate a CMM and get a precise part measurement. This device is especially helpful as the skilled manufacturing/metrology workforce is retiring as it gives new employees the ability to provide accurate information with little/no training. This innovation also gives the manufacturing companies an option to buy a new machine or upgrade their existing coordinate measuring machine. While the focus of this proposal is part identification, this technology has ready applications in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, robotics, and automated assembly lines. This capability will make the US manufacturing sector stronger and more technologically advanced.

    The objective of this proposal is to develop a new technology to identify machined parts and assemblies. This technology will be implemented on coordinate measuring machines (CMM), which are used widely in the manufacturing sector to measure the shape and size of parts. The proposed technology will enable autonomous measurements of parts allowing a higher level of automation. In this identification technology, the team will use live images from a camera, multiple solid model/Computer Aided Design (CAD)-generated images, and advanced image processing. Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to the image processing of part images will ensure correct part identification. Correct identification of parts as seen by the camera is the remaining unsolved challenge to achieving self-driven automatic measurements of parts. Most machined parts are textureless and most of the information is contained in the edges. Current image processing techniques work well with texture-rich parts but are unreliable with textureless machined parts. AI/ML enhanced image processing using edge and shape information is a promising approach, solving this problem will lead to the birth of a new generation of CMMs that can measure parts automatically.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a marketable and cost-effective U.S. manufactured foundation system to support offshore wind turbines (OWTs). The planned offshore wind energy production in the U.S. has been growing rapidly and the industry is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion within the next two decades. Although only 42 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy were installed in the U.S. during the last 10 years, planned projects have been growing rapidly targeting 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050, with strong support from coastal states. Achieving the targets of offshore wind energy requires cost-effective and innovative components of these energy systems. One of the main costs for offshore wind energy systems is their foundations, with costs typically ranging from 14% to 34% of the overall project cost. OWTs are commonly supported on large-diameter foundations, which the U.S. does not have the capability to fabricate and instead relies on foundations fabricated abroad. Therefore, a U.S.-manufactured foundation system to support renewable offshore wind energy infrastructure, enhance domestic supply chains, and reduce dependency on foreign manufactured foundations is proposed. The result of this research is a U.S.-manufactured alternative with savings of over half the cost per meter, enabling wider adoption of alternative energy harnessing technologies.


    The goal of the proposed project is to develop a U.S.-manufactured, bio-inspired, enhanced capacity foundation system to support offshore wind energy infrastructure that provides technical improvements and cost-saving to currently used systems. The proposed project also provides: (1) ease of adoption by providing similar weight and installation approaches to current means and methods; (2) better durability and longer service life than currently used OWT foundations; and (3) improved speed of construction promoting scalability. Furthermore, the proposed system will allow for optimized design, increasing the foundation capacity and improving the installation process.  Preliminary tests show that the proposed design could improve the foundation capacity by up to 100% compared to that of the currently used foundation systems when subjected to long-term cyclic loading similar to those experienced by OWTs.  The proposed concept could be used as a driven pile, suction caisson, anchors, or gravity base providing several options for the offshore wind energy industry in the U.S. To achieve the project goal, this research will focus on: (1) verification of key material properties for marine environmental conditions, (2) structural design of foundation cross-sections, (3) installation analyses on proposed foundations in marine environments; and (4) investigations of the effects of the bio-inspired design on foundation capacity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on development of a handheld optical scanner that integrates precise imaging with optical spectroscopy.  Although this technology has broad applications ranging from industrial quality control to education, the beachhead sector to be addressed is precision agriculture. To feed a growing population of 10 billion in 2050, agricultural production will need to increase by 70% over the next 30 years. Critical to this mission is the development of innovative tools and strategies for crop protection and health management to preserve the world’s food supply. The potential customers in this segment are crop growers, consultants, and field scouts aiming to act early while reducing the use of harmful and costly chemicals. The global crop monitoring market was estimated at $2 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $6 billion by 2027, growing at 15.3% annually. The sensing and imaging segment accounted for 49.3% of the market in 2019. This technology has the potential to support the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices as well as the economic viability of small- to medium-scale farm operations in the U.S. by providing an accessible and affordable tool for disease detection and crop health management.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the commercial development of novel and affordable imaging spectroscopy technology in addition to application-specific analytics for the early detection of crop afflictions. Optical components of the scanning device that will be designed-for-manufacturing in this project bridge the current gap created by systems that trade the detection capabilities of spectral resolution for spatial resolution. The scanner will be deployed to collect data on grapes, a key, high-value crop that is susceptible to a number of afflictions that destroy yields before the human eye can detect them. Machine learning algorithms will be developed from this data to detect stressed and diseased states in the plant before they become apparent to visual inspection. These models will then be validated in the field with user feedback from horticultural experts and customers. Successful implementation of this technology will facilitate the detection of crop diseases before they spread. This detection capability can increase yields while reducing the use of costly and environmentally-harmful pesticides and fertilizers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop bio-based antioxidant products for industrial processes. Commercial development of peptide antioxidants has been limited for use in consumer, food, or therapeutic applications. This project will develop peptide antioxidants derived from the enzymatic digestion of agricultural biomass as alternatives to synthetic antioxidants used in the processing and storage of industrial fluids. Although synthetic antioxidants are critical for the stabilization of many industrial processes, they are derived from petroleum and tend to have toxicity and/or environmental safety concerns. The products resulting from this effort will be first-in-class innovations; safer and more environmentally responsible than existing products. Project activities will validate peptide performance in the initial target application area: the stabilization of vinyl monomer fluids and processes. This research will initially focus on vinyl monomer processing as well as four additional industrial markets where sustainable antioxidants could have a high impact. The estimated consumption of synthetic antioxidants in the five combined markets in 2022 will be close to 1 million tons.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a bio-based antioxidant product derived from sustainable materials and suitable for industrial process fluids. Antioxidant peptides derived from the enzymatic digestion of plant-based proteins have the potential to replace synthetic antioxidants in industrial processes. This project focuses on process compatibility, product stability, and antioxidative performance as key technical hurdles. This project will create a library of antioxidative peptides generated by the enzymatic digestion of plant proteins. This library will then be tested for the solubility of peptides with representative fluids under process conditions, potential formulation design, and for thermal and storage stability of the designed formulations. This project will lower technical barriers to advancing the commercial development of peptide antioxidants for applications across many industries.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential reduction of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from marine diesel engines. There are approximately 4 million diesel-powered craft in use globally, emitting approximately one billion tons of CO2 and 100 million tons of NOx annually. This project seeks to remove at least 80% of the NOx and 30% of the CO2 from marine diesel exhaust, contributing to a reduction in both greenhouse gas emissions and in air pollution that creates health hazards in coastal cities. There is no alternative, commercially-viable product that reduces CO2 and NOx emissions from marine diesel engines. The proposed concept seeks to overcome the disadvantages of competing technologies that are unworkable due to heat and space restraints in a confined boat engine room. The project may enable boat manufacturers to meet new international maritime regulations on engine emissions and may contribute new knowledge related to the engineering of monitoring and delivery systems for marine and land/vehicle emissions reduction systems. In addition to environmental benefits, the technology meets a global commercial demand and creates good paying jobs for an export-oriented US industry.

    The goal of this project is to develop a low thermal electro-emulsification solution to reduce emissions in marine diesel exhaust, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 80% to meet the new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 30%. The technology will be incorporated into a fuel processing system that can be integrated into existing diesel engines on marine boats. This system will precisely inject reaction-altering chemicals at the proper time in the combustion cycle to reach the desired reduction of CO2 and NOx. The system will also monitor the exhaust stream to ensure no harmful byproducts are discharged into the marine environment. This work will further develop the understanding of diesel emissions reduction and may be transferable to other vehicle and land-based applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of advancing methods for preparing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for sequencing. Prior to sequencing a biological sample, DNA must be liberated from cells and separated from proteins and other unwanted debris, and then mixed with specialty buffers and chemical agents. This skilled task is currently carried out by trained scientists using largely manual manipulations of the samples and expensive equipment. The alternative method proposed in this project will speed-up diagnoses from genomic sequencing by significantly reducing preparation time while also making preparation more reliable through automation. Notably, the proposed approach is expected to prepare DNA without reducing its length; consequently, the process should be ideally suited for preparing samples for emerging long-read sequencing technologies. These improvements have the potential to decrease the burden and costs associated with DNA sequencing, hence expanding the benefits of DNA sequencing technology to wider segments of society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies upon a process for trapping genomic material in a small flow cell through which an electric field and pressure-driven flow are simultaneously applied. The process is highly selective towards strands of DNA or (ribonucleic acid) RNA; proteins and other, unwanted debris that enters the flow cell passes through. Also, the process is relatively gentle, so the length of sample should not be shortened as a result. This project will advance the technology to the marketplace by: (1) Completing cartridge design details and fabrication, including evaluation of material options; (2) Building a custom research and development platform for interfacing with the cartridges; (3) Developing methods for DNA sample extraction and transfer; (4) Developing the library preparation protocols using mixing and heating while toggling the Electro-Hydrodynamic Trapping; and, (5) Integrating the entirety of the preparation process into a single cartridge and validating the process performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide private and public stakeholders with new technological tools to better monitor and predict pandemics. This project is expected to modernize the tools used today by private and public laboratories to collect and purify pathogens, particularly human coronaviruses from community wastewater, for testing and diagnostic purposes. The new technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and time, and enable the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient time to take preventive measures. The technological products of this project are expected to empower the growing number of companies and laboratories offering wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) services and help establish WBE as a routine, cost-effective and reliable tool for public health monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small volumes.  These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The project’s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater to over 90%, while reducing costs. The developed tools will be independently tested and evaluated by third-party laboratories to confirm their performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the need for an accessible method to identify early-stage epithelial cancers, with high accuracy, earlier and at lower cost than is currently available. In 2020, the total cost of cancer care was nearly $210 billion. Due to the nature of current cancer diagnostics, most cancers are diagnosed and treated during late-stages. This results in a large economic burden to patients, families, healthcare providers, and facilities. To advance the health and welfare of the public and reduce the nation’s healthcare burden, there is a need for cancer screening, diagnostic, and monitoring devices that are non-invasive, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and accurate. The proposed platform for the early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers 1) addresses the lack of effective non-invasive portable screening devices; 2) provides faster, more discriminatory assessments in near real-time; 3) yields the most precise and accurate results to identify cancers earlier, when interventions are more impactful, less expensive, less invasive, and more likely to improve patient outcomes.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the feasibility of developing the first portable, programmable, single cell cytology platform for early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers, suitable for use at the point-of-care. The proposed technology will uniquely combine microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI) to act as a sensor and provide predictive analysis, allowing for the accurate classification of potentially cancerous tissue. The platform will support near real-time, multiparameter, single-cell cytology measurements and will provide a method for automated analysis of a plurality of key metrics. Proof of concept has been established for the application area of oral cavity cancers, with the approach demonstrating superior performance metrics compared to other diagnostics (tissue reflectance, tissue auto fluorescence, salivary testing, and cytology testing). It is the only adjunct that can distinguish between mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The key objectives for this project are to develop methodologies to link different clinical specimen types to the microfluidics environment, and a biomarker discovery process to identify biomarkers for different applications that are amenable to the platform. The successful completion of this project will enable the platform to recognize and assess various levels of dysplasia across multiple epithelial cancer types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in demonstrating the commercial viability and clinical benefit of a point-of-care diagnostics device based on novel technologies for patients with urinary tract infections. There are 10 million primary care visits for urinary tract infections per year in the United States. More than 15% of these patients suffer antibiotic-resistant infections. Clinical studies have shown that accurate identification and early diagnosis of the antibiotic resistance of the infecting bacteria shorten the treatment period, eliminate antibiotic misuse, and reduce average patient costs. However, on-site diagnostic testing that returns molecular information about the bacterial identity and antibiotic resistance remains a significant challenge. Current laboratory-based tests are costly, have long turnaround times, and require skilled technicians and well-equipped laboratories. In most cases, this results in empirical antibiotic prescriptions before the information is returned from test results. Developing rapid, on-site, easy-to-implement, and frequently used antimicrobial resistance screening is essential to combat the ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic misuse. This device will be suitable for outpatient clinics, home healthcare, and inpatient facilities. It will enable a shift from empirical to evidence-based treatment of bacterial infections.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a point-of-care device for the on-site identification of E. coli and associated extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) antibiotic resistance genes in urinary tract infections from unprocessed urine samples. The device uses novel, patent-pending electrochemical nucleic acid sensing techniques and a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay to semi-quantitatively measure target bacterial genes. The device consists of a disposable microfluidic cartridge and a portable multifunctional reader. The self-contained microfluidic sensing cartridge supports sample preparation, isothermal amplification, and sequence-specific electrochemical detection. This novel combination of sensing technology and highly integrated sample handling microfluidics will enable the development of critically needed point-of-care diagnostic solutions. The project will demonstrate the specificity of bacterial detection, the ability to identify multiple genotypes, the ease of device operation, and the portability of this point-of-care device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the communication between Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) individuals and the hearing community through automated sign language recognition. In the United States alone there are over 48 million D/HH individuals, who in total possess $87 billion in purchasing power. It appears businesses are not adequately serving this community, as is evidenced by the plethora of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) lawsuits against numerous companies. The proposed technology will provide plug-and-play software for organizations to improve their interactions with D/HH individuals. Businesses and governments will be able to interact with their D/HH employees, customers, or constituents when interpreters are unavailable. This technology can be integrated into a variety of platforms, from retail point-of-sale equipment to chatbots and video/teleconferencing systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project aims to develop technology to perform unconstrained sign language recognition and natural sign language production. Specifically, current methods to train language translation models are ill-equipped to handle the sign language domain due to the lack of training data within this domain. Additionally, all currently established methods (apart from motion capture, which is unscalable) for producing American Sign Language (ASL) result in stilted, unnatural signing from an avatar. This project will develop solutions to these issues within the domain of ASL via semi-supervised expert-augmented models and data augmentation techniques. Technical hurdles include the lack of models to handle high-dimensional low-resource language domains, and lack of sufficiently large datasets. Technical milestones include creating semi-supervised datasets, engineering data augmentation techniques, generating a natural signing avatar, and performing extensive usability testing. This project aims to produce a method for automatically interpreting between a low-resource sign language and English to improve accessibility and increase equity for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the high cost of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. As the world transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, the market for fuel cells is expected to increase substantially. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have a number of advantages, such as high durability, long range, and fast refueling over battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, fuel cells are less susceptible to the supply chain issues that lithium-ion batteries are beginning to suffer from. However, FCEVs are currently at a significant disadvantage to BEVs in terms of cost. Reducing the cost of the fuel cell stack will help to make FCEVs cost competitive with BEVs and will accelerate their adoption into the marketplace.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells by reducing the cost of the bipolar plate component. Bipolar plates currently account for approximately 30% of the full fuel cell stack cost. Current bipolar plates are made from either metal foils or molded carbon composites. Metal plates can be produced by high-speed, low-cost forming techniques, but must be made from expensive, corrosion resistant materials. Carbon bipolar plates are made from inexpensive precursors but are manufactured by processes which scale poorly. This project aims to demonstrate that a bipolar plate can be produced from a novel, low-cost, carbon-based sheet utilizing forming techniques analogous to those used for producing metallic bipolar plates. The effort focuses on optimizing the carbon sheet for low hydrogen permeability, demonstrating that flow channels can be stamped into the sheets, and quantifying functionality and durability by testing in small scale fuel cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to ensure robust consumer protection for financial applications using distributed ledger technology (DLT). This project aims to improve upon existing global financial infrastructure by replacing it with a safe, open, accessible network powered by the proposed next-generation distributed ledger architecture. Accessing traditional financial networks is a major challenge, and often requires significant capital coupled with deep industry connections. As DLT stands today, there are still challenges for it to safely support financial applications. DLT vulnerabilities can cost users billions of dollars and is leading to the same monopolistic dynamics that are characteristic of traditional financial infrastructure. This project aims to advance the foundation of distributed ledger technology to address these issues, and deliver an accessible, safe, democratized financial infrastructure that can operate on a global scale and support the untold myriad of value-added use cases from companies that cannot sustain the high economic costs, or overcome the accessibility barriers, of traditional financial infrastructure.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to advance distributed ledger technology to safely support financial primitives. Transaction information in modern distributed ledgers is public during origination, allowing validators to exploit this information and at times their privileged position to attack every financial primitive. As an example, there are issues with validators taking arbitrage opportunities and sequencing their own transactions first. Financial best practices are to silo transactions into distinct lifecycle stages to ensure consumer safety. This solution brings these best practices to DLT through a cryptographic commitment scheme. Cryptographic commitment schemes allow users to commit to an action without disclosing sensitive details, however, the traditional process requires centralization to coordinate the timing for disclosure. The primary research goal and objective for this Phase I project is proving the viability of a decentralized commitment scheme with real world latency and no centralized timekeeping or coordination mechanism. The proposed architecture will allow users to initiate transactions without including sensitive transaction details at origination. Without sensitive transaction details, validators can no longer exploit this information for their own gain, allowing this architecture to provide the security and privacy necessary for improved safety for financial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel and emerging method for treating a subset of heart failure patients. Despite modern medical regimen and device therapies, heart failure affects 6 million Americans and remains a leading cause of death and hospitalization in the United States. The proposed system and approach aim to provide a novel procedure and treatment paradigm by leveraging an established clinical access procedure for performing Greater Splanchnic Ablation (GSN). The system would enable rapid and wider clinical adoption of the emerging therapy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel, minimally invasive, catheter-delivered, venous procedure for performing extravascular Greater Splanchnic Ablation (GSN). The proposed catheter system utilizes a clinically accepted venous approach in order to perform extravascular denervation, while minimizing collateral (off-target) damage to the other surrounding tissues. The objectives of this project include designing and prototyping new devices that will enable localized energy delivery and incorporate a detection system indicative of procedural success. Both benchtop testing and pre-clinical animal model studies will be used to access and ablate, verifying the function and performance of the device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to promote the viability and sustainability of small-to-medium indoor, urban, and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) farms. As the global population grows to 10 billion by 2050, the agriculture industry will need to produce 70% more food using only 5% more land. Indoor farming can make a significant contribution to meet this demand sustainably. Indoor farmers are also seasonally and geographically independent, which means they can help meet demands for locally produced fresh foods and are protected from extreme weather events. These farms primarily use soilless growing methods, such as hydroponics, that currently suffer from critical needs for efficient and affordable methods to monitor and manage nutrients and water in order to be financially viable and environmentally sustainable. The proposed project provides an innovative solution for nutrient management in hydroponic farming, thereby lowering the costs, increasing the yield potential, and supporting the viability of such farms. By supporting the expansion of the national hydroponics industry, this project will increase the local production of and expand access to fresh produce.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a nutrient management system to provide CEA farmers with real-time information about the nutrients in the growth solution of their crops.  The proposed solution will utilize ion-selective electrode (ISE) technology and a decision support system powered by machine learning (ML). This project will focus on the critically needed engineering and data analytics research and development to de-risk major technical challenges in the development of the nutrient management system, providing proof-of-feasibility. The key objectives of this project are to: 1) design a special chamber for the sensors to minimize the interference and increase accuracy, 2) validate the feasibility and accuracy of this new design in a greenhouse setting, 3) develop a predictive algorithm to automatically calibrate the sensors, and 4) measure and predict deficiencies in leafy greens production: collecting empirical evidence of nutrient deficiency to train ML models to identify, and ultimately, predict a deficiency prior to when it is observable.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a low footprint drinking water treatment plant (WTP) suited to facilitate much-needed upgrades to the nation’s water infrastructure. Today’s drinking water treatment systems are suffering from high volumes of generated waste (~100,000 tons sludge per typical plant per year) and high maintenance requirements and costs (4x/year week-long clarifier decommissioning for cleaning). The aging infrastructure of many of the nation’s water treatment plants has left millions of Americans with inadequate drinking water. This situation, paired with the aging and shrinking water operator workforce, translates into a growing threat of water supply interruptions and noncompliance. Owing to its small footprint and low energy and maintenance demands, the proposed technology would deliver an easily implementable solution that could be adopted by communities and water systems around the world, even in remote areas. Successfully developed, the WTP will offer a unique economic opportunity to meet critical global sustainable development goals and promote human health and welfare. This technology will lower the barriers to upgrading the nation’s water infrastructure, creating jobs through the introduction of long-delayed upgrades through plant implementation.

    Elements of the innovation under development for the proposed water treatment plant include a self-modulating feedback/feedforward controller driving automated coagulant dosing, which is paired with a high-efficiency hydraulic flocculator that leverages turbulent flow to promote floc formation while remaining free of failure-prone moving parts; a self-cleaning clarifier fitted with settling plates and a sludge blanket system for efficient contaminant removal; a stacked sand filter that decreases the hydraulic loading rate for a given flow and bed volume, resulting in improved stability of the deposited particles (i.e., reduced shear and particle breakthrough); and a continuous sludge dewatering and treatment system that decreases the volume of produced sludge while also providing a continuous waste stream for further processing. While early efforts have established a proof-of-concept demonstrating operations at 50% less energy demand than conventional systems, continued research and development to improve system performance and autonomy are needed. In line with this effort, the Phase I effort will focus on: 1) development of an automated control system for precise coagulant dosing; 2) design modification to minimize waste stream volume; and 3) design and construction of a pilot plant with 15 gallons per minute capacity, suitable to meet the water treatment needs of communities of ~300 people.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes a notable reduction in the area burned\
    \ by lightning-initiated wildfires. Understanding which lightning strikes are\
    \ capable of igniting wildfires is critical as in the Western U.S. lightning-initiated\
    \ wildfires are responsible for over 70% of the area burned in these environmental\
    \ catastrophes. Globally, wildfires are responsible for 6.45 gigatons of carbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) emissions annually (18% of total emissions). Detecting high risk\
    \ lightning strikes (those capable of igniting wildfires) may also significantly\
    \ reduce losses of life, wildlife, habitats, property, and forests as currently\
    \ lightning-initiated wildfires in the US devastate 4-6 million acres per year.\
    \ The reduction of wildfires can reduce large evacuations and smoke-related health\
    \ conditions, thereby improving the health and welfare of the American public.\
    \ Both people and businesses would benefit from lower insurance rates due to the\
    \ decreased risk of wildfire damage. Large wildfires are a constant concern to\
    \ more than half of the mission assurance priority military installations due\
    \ to routine testing and training activities that are significant ignition sources.\
    \ The proposed project may also address military ignition concerns. \n\nWildfires\
    \ start when a long continuing current (LCC) strikes the ground at a location\
    \ where the environmental conditions are conducive for fire ignition. LCCs are\
    \ those that last for 40 ms or longer and are essentially responsible for excessive\
    \ heating. The transformative aspect of this research lies in the ground-based\
    \ characterization of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) lightning emissions to identify\
    \ LCC strikes, with a 95% target detection efficiency and with 40 m accuracy.\
    \ While for most lightning strikes the current ceases to flow after tens of microseconds,\
    \ a small portion of lightning strikes (less than 10%) contain a continuing current\
    \ that lasts thousands of times longer, from tens to hundreds of milliseconds.\
    \ This can be viewed as a quasi-stationary arc between the cloud charge source\
    \ and the ground and is detectable through electrostatic field changes and ELF\

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing solutions to farmers who are facing the culmination of decades of herbicide resistant weed species evolving from applications of synthetic herbicides. Creation of herbicides which are effective, naturally produced, scalable, and deployed using the current agronomic practices could alter the foundations of crop production in the United States and around the world. In view of the projected 8% annual increase in global food and agriculture market, shrinking areas under cultivation that lead to the need for higher productivity per acre, and increasing demand for nutritional food items, the need for sustainable alternatives to current synthetic herbicides that do not promote herbicide resistant weeds is becoming clearer. Widespread adoption of the proposed technology is expected to benefit farmers and crop producers reducing societal strain, financial burden, and environmental stress from crop losses due to herbicide resistant weeds by eliminating these weeds through an environmentally safe method, without the use of excess fuel, time, equipment, and synthetic herbicides.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a novel natural herbicide product that, when applied to herbicide resistant weeds, will cause seed or plant cell's membranes to degrade and lose integrity. Thus, the novel product is intended to work both as pre-emergent weed prevention and post-emergent weed control herbicide. The product will be an environmentally safe blend of natural plant extracts and excipients. The herbicide formulations will be sprayable onto soil or onto plant leaves and stems. The cost and time needed to initially screen herbicide rates, outcomes, and best practices typically is many years. The greenhouse screening approach takes months and provides valuable information to ensure that field trials, which are more expensive and impacted by changes in weather, are efficient in cost and outcomes. This project will initially focus on greenhouse validation of weed control of the most resistant weeds known in different geographical locations in the U.S. Dose response data for 50%-to-90% inhibition control/efficacy of herbicide resistant weeds will provide the information to develop a herbicide use label, directions for best practices, and good stewardship by using only the amount of herbicide needed for control without overuse.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will result from the production of a useful game, called College Bound, that will entice youth to use their gaming time to learn how to navigate the college preparation, college-admissions, and financial-aid processes.  This assistance could help in addressing the problem of an inadequate number of counselors in high schools that serve large minority populations. Studies have shown that underserved high school students see a counselor for less than 20 minutes a year.  Since is also known that young people between the ages of 8-18 spend 7.5 hours a day engaged with media- either playing video games or watching television a game platform may enable minority students, who make up less than 4% of undergraduate enrollees in the national four-year colleges, to prepare for college attendence. The College Bound game seeks to recoup some of this screen time for positive benefits such as improving preparedness of the minority students to access higher education, and meeting future workforce demands in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on assisting underrepresented students in learning about what it takes to get college admission, how to prepare for it, and what financial aid is available to afford the education using a gaming environment. The project will focus on measuring students' knowledge about the college application process as the player navigates through different levels of the game. Knowledge about the college application process includes a) information about admission criteria and deadlines, b) the college acceptance and enrollment processes, and c) the ability to pay for college through scholarships, loans, work programs, and/or personal savings. Throughout the pilot phase, the project will develop reliable and valid evaluation tools to measure student learning in the game setting at each level of the College Bound game. These evaluation tools might reflect not only student learning performance but also boost college enrollment outcomes. These measures may also enable the school and other stakeholders to understand students' gaps and help strengthen students’ pathways into college.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to implement a high-efficiency, low-power magnetic bearing that will enable the successful development of high-speed flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) both for space and terrestrial applications. FESS are mechanical batteries that overcome some of the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, such as the loss of energy capacity over time and the need for stringent temperature control. In space, FESS could reduce the overall mass associated with the battery pack and extend the mission life of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. On earth, FESS can take over some of the applications that are required to deliver high power for a short amount of time, such as electric vehicle charging stations or hospital back-up power units. Ultimately, FESS will help alleviate the demand for lithium-ion batteries while providing reliable, long-lasting energy storage.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the proposed magnetic bearing into a carbon-fiber flywheel. The complexity of this task comes from having the three main parts of the flywheel (composite rim, metal core, and magnets) created using different manufacturing processes. The magnetic materials need to be protected as they will not withstand the high speeds of FESS. De-risking this manufacturing process is crucial in continuing the development of this technology and in scaling up. Another challenge is that the high speeds of FESS are expected to cause high gyroscopic torques during satellite maneuvers. Therefore, investigating ways to increase bearing stiffness (e.g., by changing magnet size and position, or modifying coil shape), while assessing the effect of gyroscopic torques through numerical models, will be paramount. Finally, the magnetic bearing has the distinctive feature of being able to tilt the flywheel (within its gap tolerances), without requiring an external gimbal actuator. This feature could possibly allow the technology to be used for dual purposes, and its implications will be investigated at a system level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the fast and efficient loading of parcels into shipping containers ranging from small delivery vans to maritime shipping containers. This project will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of an algorithmic approach and robotic development. The technology is a step towards creating a fully autonomous system with expanded robotics capability to further enhance the efficiency and speed of outbound shipping for customers. Over 3,000 parcels are shipped every second. However, in the U.S., one out of every four trucks is empty, two are less than 50% filled, and only one is filled over 50% capacity.  Initial projections indicate that the technology under development could decrease trucking costs by 20%, reduce loading costs by 70-80%, and decrease loading time by 30%, all while meeting the demands of peak shipping seasons. Overall, increasing the density of parcel shipping will reduce greenhouse gas emissions (400 tons/per truck/per year), reduce traffic congestion, and enable smaller businesses to compete with large organizations by reducing their logistics and shipping operating costs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on advancing a bin packing algorithm to minimize void space in outbound shipping containers. The 3-Dimentional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) is a classic Nonlinear Programming (NP)-hard problem that has been studied for decades. To solve the problem, an effective and easy-to-implement constrained, quantum accelerated, deep reinforcement learning model is being developed. Monte Carlo Tree Search is an unsupervised, heuristic search algorithm technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable occurring at the end of a sequence of states. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) extends this technique by allowing the learned state-values to guide actions which subsequently change the environment state. A proof-of-concept assessment showed that the learned strategy meaningfully outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Outcome success metrics for this project are >90% utilization rate, sub 24 hours of model training time, and >2500 parcels/hour for any given data set. This foundation will be expanded by integrating many unique box sizes, exploring model performance in the face of broader circumstances (e.g., lookahead and stacking parameters, General Processing Unit (GPU) vs quantum training), and developing of a robotic gripper to enact algorithmic output.

These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in the marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a significant improvement in the accuracy of weather forecasts by increasing the refresh rate of sea wind measurements ten-fold. This forecast improvement will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States by improving efficiency in maritime, agriculture, and logistics industries. Improved weather forecasts will advance the health and welfare of the American public by enabling earlier storm warnings that save thousands of lives.  Improved weather forecasts will support national defense, while also saving hundreds of millions of dollars in false-alarm hurricane evacuations. Sea wind data will also directly benefit maritime operators, including recreational sailors, ocean carriers and fishers. Wind map and forecast subscriptions from maritime customers represent a $3 billion commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to study the feasibility of increasing the refresh rate of sea wind measurements ten-fold using a constellation of nanosatellite radars (scatterometers). Current satellites for measuring sea winds are prohibitively expensive and performance has not substantially improved since they were introduced decades ago. The objective of this research is to evaluate the measurement accuracy, cost, and refresh rate of the proposed nanosatellite scatterometers. Additional objectives study the regulatory feasibility, post-processing feasibility, and commercial feasibility. The research includes calculations of the radar signal, heat, data geolocation, cost, mass, data rate, latency, radio interference, and license feasibility. The research also includes simulations of the radar measurement geometry, the post-processing, the wind maps that will be generated by the scatterometer, as well as the constellation, its operations, and its replenishment requirements. The studies in this project answer key feasibility and performance questions posed by potential users. The results, such as data quality, availability, and simulated sample data, will be used in customer discovery to ensure the needs of potential users are met.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that the proposed delivery system will advance many RNA therapeutic solutions to address intimal hyperplasia (IH) and other vascular conditions. Vascular disease is the most common disease pathology in the US, costing the country’s healthcare system over $437 billion dollars annually. Because vascular interventions have limited long-term success, there is a critical need for effective therapeutics, including to address the condition of IH which, post intervention, can lead to restenosis, or artery narrowing. By delivering therapeutics safely and efficaciously to specific tissues, the proposed technology will result in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity and, in combination with a Contact Research Organization business model, will contribute to the advancement of a multitude of RNA therapeutics targeting the vascular system and eventually other areas of the body. Eventually, the platform will contribute to the development and commercialization of a broad range of RNA drugs, creating jobs in science, sales, and manufacturing. This project will lead to improvements in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions that currently lack effective therapy, resulting in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity in the broader society.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel multifunctional lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system for tissue-specific targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics to the vascular system. Intimal hyperplasia (IH), a condition triggered by mechanical injury to blood vessels, causes artery thickening in ~ 60% of peripheral vascular disease patients 12 months post-intervention. IH often results in the need for additional surgical intervention with associated costs and increased patient morbidity and mortality. This project will focus on inhibiting the remodeling pathways that lead to IH via RNA therapeutics delivered directly to the injury site. The project will develop vascular targeting liposomes designed to exhibit multifunctional potential to target exposed collagen matrices specific to areas of vascular pathology and enhanced targeted vascular uptake/delivery. Phase I will advance the LNP technology by showing that an active therapeutic encapsulated by the system is appropriately delivered and results in a clinically relevant drug concentration. If successful at delivering bioactive RNA payloads to injured vascular tissues, the technology will reduce the risk of post-intervention complications and reduce the need for revascularization. Ultimately, this novel LNP packaging and delivery system will provide a new tool for advancing a broad range of RNA therapeutics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project centers on offering a lower-cost, more accessible alternative to help people everywhere learn to speak a new language. By using state-of-the-art conversational artificial intelligence (AI), the project offers students individualized, curriculum-based learning that is affordable and accessible 24 hours a day, with no limits on the amount of time they can practice. Additionally, the AI system will be able to analyze learners’ speech to offer suggestions on ways to improve their grammar and conversational fluency, in much the same way a trained tutor would assist a student. The project brings conversational AI to the language learning market, enabling a more effective, entertaining, and low-cost product to transform the current language learning paradigm.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an innovative integration effort to combine state-of-the-art AI technologies for education applications. The project will contribute new user-adaptive algorithms and datasets for dialog policy training on language learning tasks. The project will contribute to the company’s open-source, multimodal, dialog system framework to enable the dialog community to reduce the entry barrier for multimodal dialog system research. The project will also provide the community with an annotated conversational dataset for grammatical error correction along with a trained grammar correction model and grammar error type detector. The developed educational dialog systems for second language communication learning can also serve as a general framework for education experts to test different learning theories. This project will also explore hypotheses of whether adaptive conversation experience and different feedback structures will impact learner confidence and learning gain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to commercialize a process to produce low carbon, bio-based acrylic acid and acrylates for paints, coatings, adhesives, and superabsorbent polymer markets. This $10 billion market has been seeking a bio-based, low-carbon alternative for decades, with economics serving as the major barrier. This project’s high yield lactic-to-acrylic technology will help grow the corn utilization industry and provide high paying jobs across rural America as well as economic competitiveness in global markets. Every plant constructed to convert lactic acid fermented from sugar into drop-in, low-carbon, renewable acrylic acid is estimated to bring $12 million in economic activity to a county with significant bio-based sugar crops (e.g., corn, beets, cane). Approximately 250 plants are needed at this scale to convert today’s petrochemical acrylic acid to a bio-based source.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to utilize high alcohol content feedstocks using catalyst innovation comprising engineered amine treatment of cation-exchanged zeolites. The catalyst has been shown to outperform numerous previously-utilized catalysts with >90% yields of acrylic products during catalyzed dehydration of lactic acid. So far, those in the field have investigated feeds containing aqueous solutions of methyl lactate or lactic acid in concentrations from 10-40%. Methanol has not been used as a co-feed in concentrations greater than 5%, therefore this project will investigate higher concentrations of alcohols (5%-80%, using methanol or ethanol).  The project will use both methanol and ethanol as the alcohol size is likely to alter active site reactivity and/or shift the equilibrium of esterified versus acidic acrylate products. These experiments address two areas of concern in the commercialization of the technology and determine the relative dehydration rates of ethanol and lactic acid under competitive adsorption conditions to provide foundational information required for reactor scaling. The proposed research also increases the percentage of alkyl acrylates formed by forcing the gas phase esterification of acrylic acid with alcohol towards completion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is expanding global deployment of wind turbines with increased production not obtainable with today’s fixed blades. An adaptable blade with advanced control capabilities helps solve technical and scientific challenges as wind projects accelerate their move offshore, extending the physics of the larger turbines needed for future wind farms. Developing a high-fidelity modeling tool to design morphing blades capable of boosting energy production, reducing wear and tear, dampening vibration, improving stability, and reducing load effectively achieves two crucial goals.  These goals include accelerating the deployment of renewable energy with affordable electricity that is efficiently and economically extracted from wind and improving the loading and stability necessary for the development of floating wind farms capable of installation in challenging water depths and extreme weather. The technology proposed makes large turbines better at capturing wind in more locations to protect against volatile energy prices, generate jobs, and promote greater participation in the global energy transition for developed and developing countries alike. Furthermore, the blade technology resulting from this research provides opportunities for new manufacturing techniques and commercial applications in other industries such as aviation, automotive, and marine renewable energy.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to examine a high-fidelity model to support the design and control of an advanced wind turbine blade configuration with an adaptive twist angle distribution (TAD). Conventional control is generally applied to rotor torque to maximize wind capture, and thus production, below the rated wind speed. Above this speed, control shifts to the blade pitch angle to maintain full power. However, limitations in existing designs lead to trade-offs where wind capture or power production is relinquished to reduce loads, mitigate vibration, and improve stability. The actively adaptive TAD provides greater control capabilities and satisfies these objectives without trade-offs. A crucial goal of this research is the means to understand the complex aeroelastic and aerodynamic relationships with respect to the TAD. The technology is a high-fidelity model that simulates these dynamics and the aeroelastic performance in a reasonable amount of time. This model involves the development of a framework combining these dynamics and uses computational tools that leverage data analytics and machine learning. The technical result of the proposed work is the creation of a digital twin that enables effective design and robust control of highly sophisticated blades with adaptive TAD.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide low-cost hydrogen (H2) with a very low or even negative carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint at a commercial production cost reaching $1.50 per kg of H2 alongside a valuable solid carbon by-product, representing a technology advance for the American public and economy. The United States produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year - 95% of it via steam methane reforming (SMR).  SMR emits 100 million tons of CO2 in the process. This represents a >$10 billion market in the US alone and an important opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions. Methane pyrolysis promises green hydrogen with >5 times less energy than water electrolysis at costs competitive with steam methane reforming by producing solid carbon instead of gaseous carbon dioxide. The solid carbon, if produced correctly, can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete. The research in this project could increase the value of the solid carbon by-product produced alongside clean hydrogen in methane pyrolysis. If successful, this technology could lead to expanded domestic production capabilities with net-zero emissions from sectors such as fertilizer, transportation (batteries, fuel cells, synthetic fuels, and tires), and heavy industry (steel and cement).

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method to tune the production of high-quality solid carbon using methane pyrolysis. Carbon black forms in pyrolysis reactors both homogeneously in the gas phase and heterogeneously on catalysts, reactor walls, and on seed particles entrained in the gas. By tuning temperature, residence time, flow profile, and seed materials, this project will result in an improved understanding of carbon precipitation and formation in methane pyrolysis reactors. This improved understanding and the development of a reactor thermochemical model will ultimately lead to better control of a process to produce high quality solid carbon that can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing high-efficiency, low-cost, crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells without using silicon wafers. For the first time, additive manufacturing processes will be applied to silicon in order to produce equivalent performance to silicon wafers without the wasteful processes used in current manufacturing. If successful, this additive approach can link the parts of the solar supply chain that still exist in the United States—silicon refining and solar module assembly, establishing a full domestic supply chain for this critical energy technology. This supply chain can: (a) be built with off-the-shelf equipment at a third the cost of building traditional silicon wafer and cell factories, (b) cut the cost of photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing in half compared to imported silicon wafer-based solar cells, and (c) reduce energy consumption in solar cell manufacturing by 70% and reduce water consumption by 90%.  This combination of low factory and production costs can drive the growth needed in the solar industry to support the nation’s decarbonization goals while creating tens of thousands of domestic jobs.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel architecture and additive manufacturing process for crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells that provide equivalent performance to traditional silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost with a local supply chain. The steps in the process flow are adapted from traditional solar cell processing or adjacent industries like microelectronics, but they are being combined in new way to realize this solar cell design. These steps will be co-optimized to produce high-efficiency cells using a series of designed experiments. These processes typically fall into three categories: (1) chemical or physical vapor deposition, (2) solution-based coating, and (3) thermal annealing, with their own relevant process variables: (a) time, temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, and magnetic power; (b) solvent, solution concentration, coating gap, and coating speed; (c) temperature vs. time. These process variables for each step will be correlated to physical properties of the layers in the cell stack such as thickness, stoichiometry, and performance of the finished cells to produce a prototype with performance that is compelling to investors, partners, and customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is derived from providing energy self-sufficiency to residential buildings. Fire-safe and low-cost redox flow batteries, combined with rooftop solar panels or backyard wind turbines, can meet the increased electricity needs of American families without relying on the national grid. During the daytime, solar arrays convert solar energy to chemical energy in batteries. During evenings, batteries will power houses and charge electric vehicles in family garages. Batteries play a critical role in harvesting and storing clean electricity for residential uses. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, the improved fire-safety profiles and reduced production costs of flow batteries will give homeowners peace of mind and allow the wider adoption of clean energy by society.

    This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop novel proton-conductive polymeric membranes that show reduced metal electrolyte crossovers and build the first 7 kW flow battery system that meets the energy need of a single-family house. To this end, the project will synthesize a group of phosphorylated polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) that have a phosphoric acid side chain. Such phosphoric acid groups can form unique zirconium phosphonate clusters that transport protons but deny the unwanted migration of metal cations. PBIs provide mechanical support to the zirconium-phosphate clusters. Zirconium and PBIs are bulk materials that cost significantly less than commercial perfluorosulfonic acids. The second task of this phase I project is to construct a 7 kW iron-titanium redox flow battery system. The peak electricity demand for the average American single-family house is around 7 kW. Such a battery will be connected to a rooftop solar system to meet residential electricity demands. The team plans to study various cell configuration designs. In particular, the project will focus on examining the effects of solvent channels of bipolar plates on the performance of the stack. In addition, other design parameters, such as pump flow rates and the choice of sealant materials, will be thoroughly investigated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make oil exploration and production (E&P) operations less risky and economically and technically more efficient. The new technology has the potential to achieve significant reductions in oil exploration drilling costs.  The technology will also increase long-term commercial benefits for exploration and production companies due to more accurate and reliable estimates of the recoverable reserves and production planning over the decades-long reservoir lifecycle.  These benefits will support global economic growth by ensuring a continued supply of hydrocarbons for the US and internationally during the critical transition to renewable energies. The new technology being developed under this SBIR project will also reduce the environmental impact, energy consumption, and overall carbon footprint of offshore/onshore E&P operations by reducing waste, pollution, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby directly benefiting future generations. Successful completion of the project will further reinforce the leadership of the US in utilization of advanced hydrocarbon E&P technologies and support the goal of energy independence from global markets by making US producers more effective and competitive.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of determining volumetric (3D) hydrocarbon distribution throughout large-diameter long cores with high spatial resolution (10 mm3), 95% accuracy, and 1 meter/hour throughput at the offshore/onshore wellsite. Today, this is not possible with any technology, i.e., logging data can be used to derive hydrocarbon estimates on a sparse set of points along the wellbore, while “special core analysis” at onshore laboratories takes weeks to complete. Neither of the current techniques can closely match the resolution and accuracy offered by the proposed solution. The disruptive innovation of this development is to combine 3-dimensional (3D) X-ray Multi-Energy Computed Tomography (MECT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in one wellsite core scanning instrument, thereby allowing for novel, synergistic combination of the information provided by the MECT and EIT modalities. Algorithms will be developed to combine the complementary datasets to yield 3D hydrocarbon distribution in the cores in near real-time. These algorithms will be tested on realistic digital core models. The ultimate goal of Phase I is to demonstrate that the specified target accuracy, spatial resolution, and scanning-imaging throughput for assessing 3D distribution of hydrocarbons in large cores can be achieved with the new wellsite instrument.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to overcome a limiting step in creating viable hydrogen fuel cells for the automotive industry. The solution will renew the battery catalyst without its removal from the vehicle. This will result in significant savings toward the total cost of ownership and an increase in overall system reliability, one of the top features potential customers evaluate when making automotive purchasing decisions. The transportation industry has been seeking innovations to transition to sustainable solutions such as zero-emission and green hydrogen fuel cell technologies, but the broad adoption of such vehicles is limited by the short lifespan of fuel cell electrocatalysts that operate, expensive fuel cell stack replacements, and the high costs of components. This project will make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles viable and cost-competitive with diesel and gasoline engine vehicles by extending the lifetime of the electrocatalyst and thereby the fuel cell stack. Such alternative options are needed, as diesel vehicles are responsible for around 20% of anthropogenic pollution precursor emissions, and these emissions are linked to approximately 110,000 premature deaths per year.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish a proof-of-concept approach for in-stack platinum electrocatalyst renewal. Since fuel cell electrocatalysts degrade during operation, this project will develop a breakthrough technology that enables the reuse of what was once considered expended, end-of-life fuel cells by renewing the electrocatalyst.  This renewal process can be conducted multiple times after the electrocatalyst inevitably degrades, increasing the lifetime and durability for fuel cell operation. As one of the most expensive precious metals, platinum typically used as the catalyst for automotive applications contributes to about 60% of the total fuel cell cost. This process is the first-in-kind to allow electrocatalyst renewal at the surface of the electrode without removing or replacing the fuel cell stack. This project will establish working parameters for the electrocatalyst renewal and analyze the effects of the process using a custom testing apparatus with a 3-electrode configuration and on commercial fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies in custom single-cell configurations. This team will utilize several techniques including analytical electrochemistry, microscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques to verify the effects of the process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide the refrigerant industry with the first commercial designs for separating complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures for economical recycling. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase down production and consumption of refrigerants causing global warming by 85 percent over 15 years. The societal, economical, and environmental benefits are estimated to create thousands of jobs and increase manufacturing by billions of dollars in the U.S. while reducing venting and incineration, and subsequently global temperature rise. There are millions of metric tons of mixed refrigerants that cannot be reclaimed using current fractional distillation technology. The proposed ionic liquid extractive distillation technology will make possible the separation and reuse of these complex refrigerant mixtures. The startup company funded through this project will provide a novel separation technology to the refrigerant industry that is of strategic national interest. Outreach activities, especially toward the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities will be supported through this project.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate that complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures can be separated using ionic liquids, and that the products can meet industry standard specifications. Refrigerant mixture R-404A, used broadly throughout the commercial refrigeration industry (e.g., grocery stores) is a complex, ternary azeotropic mixture containing HFC-143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), which has a high global warming potential. HFC-143a will be one of the first refrigerants to be reused in new low global warming blends containing hydrofluoroolefins if the HFC-143a can be economically separated. Over 100 complex, multicomponent refrigerant mixtures exist in the market. This project will enable the development of processes, technologies, and systems designs required for industry to meet and exceed the phase down goals. The program objectives include the separation of R-404A into components, the creation of a process model, and testing of recovered R-404A from industry to understand the effects of impurities. The results will be used to develop a technoeconomic model and commercial scale designs that the team will build and/or license to the refrigerant industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable an environmentally sustainable, reduced-carbon emissions steelmaking process for the iron and steel industry.  This industry is responsible for 7%~9% of global carbon emissions. The proposed innovation will produce no solid waste discharge and no greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the proposed innovation will contribute to the United States and society by reducing the use of precious mineral resources and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Once this innovation is proved to be successful and scalable, it can be commercialized and massively applied to the American iron and steelmaking industry, with the potential to reduce dependency on steel imports, provide greater resilience to the US manufacturing sector, and reduce the carbon footprint.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing reduced-carbon emissions steel using Super-Pure Iron Ore Powder (SPIOP) and hydrogen. Steel is ubiquitous in our lives, from bridges and skyscrapers to cars and consumer goods. Yet, producing steel often comes with a long flow sheet, high cost, waste, and pollution. The proposed innovative process uses hydrogen (H2) to directly reduce SPIOP in a high-temperature hydrogen reduction electric furnace to produce steel. The raw iron ore is first ground to a fine target size range (~0-0.076mm) to dissociate iron ore particles from gangue/impure particles such as quartz and rocks. The dissociated iron ore particles are then purified using the company’s high-intensity iron separation technologies. The purified iron ore concentrate is >99.0% purity. The hydrogen reduction process and direct reduced iron melting process occur in the same furnace, producing a one-step crude steel manufacturing process.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is in improving both student learning and workforce readiness through interdependent learning experiences. The project will create project-based environments that promote skills such as communication, critical thinking, problem solving, time management, creativity, and teamwork – all mirroring professional work environments. The technology will also promote development of skills such as project management, writing, business and data analysis, design, and presentation. Project collaboration requires that students interact frequently throughout the project completion process, including frequent mentor or teacher interactions. Such an interdependent environment creates a real-world dynamic that better prepares students to enter the workforce. The platform developed by this project is likely to create significant societal impact while participating in the fastest growing e-learning sector.

    The proposal seeks to develop a collaborative community platform using proprietary project collaboration models integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) augmented mentorship to enhance student workforce readiness. The technology will be designed to provide the right piece of information to the students and mentors at the right time. By analyzing and unifying all the content under a domain-specific semantic representation, the system will be able to aggregate and organize all the content and identify the piece for intervention that is contextually most useful.  To make project collaboration and mentorship easier between students and mentors in a trustworthy manner, modeling will be done utilizing minimal supervision. This modelling will include combining contextual embeddings from language models with graph-based neural networks to capture interactions across multiple facets.  The technology will build upon explainability of deep neural networks to provide an appropriate level of transparency into the decision making, both for the users to learn to trust the platform, as well as for the platform developers to build systems that aid in reliable, trustworthy, and fair mentoring.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that a deeper structural understanding will be developed of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), an important target for promising new anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory drugs. The project will also support the development of new compounds targeting PAR1 with the potential for improved potency and safety profiles. Such compounds could represent a new drug class for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, including kidney disease.

    The proposed project involves the confirmation of the binding site on PAR1 of small molecule ligands called parmodulins. A detailed characterization of this binding site will support the rapid design, synthesis, and testing of new and improved parmodulins with superior properties as oral medications. A combination of computational, structural biology, and synthetic methods will be combined with PAR1 cell assays to confirm the binding site and develop more detailed structure-activity relationships of the parmodulins. It is also anticipated that novel parmodulins will be identified in this project with improved safety and stability profiles.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase post-secondary student success via academic and career guidance. A large body of research on career navigation has studied how post-secondary education, career readiness (understanding viable career paths at graduation), and its interconnectedness are important for a growing number of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. With increasing undergraduate degree program offerings in response to an evolving future of work and student-to-counselor ratios of 1: 1,800 in public colleges, career guidance, and academic navigation risk being unavailable. As a result, during the pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHEs) that serve students of color and students from low-income backgrounds saw declines in enrollment that far outpaced their predominantly White peer institutions. The proposed platform intends to increase the visibility, accessibility, and discoverability of competencies to potential career and academic paths for students at IHEs. The platform envisions doing this via near-peer role models who are similar in their dimensions of self-efficacy. With more than 85 million jobs that could go unfilled by 2030, the proposed platform may help alleviate part of that shortage by widening the talent aperture.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the company’s patented technology of a unified, multi-dimensional, data representation model that creates a ‘competency fingerprint’ for each user. The data representation method enables better machine learning models to ‘infer’ competency from unstructured data of a student’s traditional and non-traditional learning experience, rather than degrees, majors, grade point averages (GPAs), or test scores. The platform uses a consistent, scalable, competency nomenclature for hard and soft skills gained via traditional academic and outside-of-the-classroom experiences to discover academic-career paths where the students’ learning competencies may be in demand. There is a significant technical challenge in adopting this technology for the inter/cross-disciplinary jobs of the future:  such a platform requires a robust, larger data set to evaluate the relevance of matching, in a discipline-agnostic context. Reduction of this variability is the key technical risk to be overcome by the proposed research and development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology enabling low-energy, resilient cooling that is capable of mitigating the environmental impacts and high costs of conventional refrigeration. There is a critical need for sustainable cooling solutions that provide an alternative to hydrofluorocarbon-based refrigerants that rely on carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting systems. This project seeks to develop a Hydrologic Open Cooling System (HOCS) that can maintain cooling chambers at 1.5-5°C utilizing 10% or less of the electrical power of conventional systems. This project unlocks environmental heat as an energy reservoir and offsets significant energy costs of conventional cooling systems. The technology can support highly efficient refrigeration at a fraction of the operational cost and electrical demand of traditional systems. Adoption of this cooling technology by small- to mid-size supermarkets would enable significant cost savings for electricity. On a broader scale, widespread implementation of this innovation across a variety of refrigeration applications would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, meeting the need for sustainable technologies to support food and energy security while upholding climate goals.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a renewable, closed container cooling system incorporating a rechargeable vacuum insulation and a novel two-stage heat pump. This project involves 1) developing a rechargeable vacuum insulation technology that does not use vacuum pumps; 2) creating a modified dewar connected to a fully renewable cooling system enabling cooled inner chambers; and 3) evaluating the ability to use environmental heat to restore the solutions that power the cooling system allowing their reuse. The novel heat pump technology is based on two asynchronous stages: the first utilizes concentration gradients as a driving mechanism enabling thermal transfer, while the second uses environmental heat to re-concentrate saline solutions after dilution during stage one. Together, these two stages enable cooling of a closed container. The project will examine system configurations able to generate large thermal gradients, enabling maintenance of 1.5-5°C temperatures within the dewar. Advantages of this system include 1) the system’s ability to cool continues in the absence of electricity making it resilient to power outages from itinerant weather, wildfires, and earthquakes; 2) lossless storage of cooling capacity; and 3) significantly reducing the greenhouse gas footprint compared to conventional refrigeration.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project will protect retail stores from loss of merchandise.\
    \  Brick-and-mortar retail is undergoing an unprecedented transformation, having\
    \ lost billions of dollars over the past decade due to labor shortages, competition\
    \ from e-commerce giants, and changing expectations from the modern consumer.\
    \ To address these issues, retailers have been adopting new digital technologies\
    \ to gain visibility into their inventory, optimize store operations, and gain\
    \ customer insights. A key technology that has been adopted by over 90% of US\
    \ retailers, is Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). RFID tags are cheap, wireless,\
    \ and battery-less stickers (similar to barcodes) that have allowed retailers\
    \ to achieve accurate store-wide inventory, resulting in a significant revenue\
    \ increase for retailers. In contrast to existing (portable) RFID technology which\
    \ can only determine whether RFID-tagged items are\nin the store (i.e., inventory),\
    \ the proposed technology aims to precisely locate these items throughout the\
    \ store. The technology leverages billions of off-the-shelf ultra-high frequency\
    \ (UHF) RFID tags that are already attached to clothing, footwear, and apparel\
    \ items. In contrast to existing mobile solutions which can only detect RFID-tagged\
    \ items, the team's handheld device leverages sophisticated signal excitation\
    \ and processing techniques to pin down each RFID’s exact position with decimeter-scale\
    \ accuracy. \n\nThis SBIR Phase 1 project will build a system capable of identifying\
    \ and precisely locating RFID-tagged items and includes three main innovative\
    \ components: (1) a portable, handheld wireless device for locating RFIDs, (2)\
    \ a scalable cloud and edge computing platform to process and store the data,\
    \ and (3) a mobile and web user interface for accessing the data and optimizing\
    \ picking tasks for retail store associates. Realizing the end-to-end platform\
    \ requires developing efficient sensor fusion algorithms and low-power, low-cost\
    \ hardware for accurate, robust, and low-latency localization. This technology\
    \ necessitates addressing challenges that arise from the computational, memory,\
    \ bandwidth, and power constraints on the edge device. The platform also requires\
    \ developing the split and cloud computing architecture to efficiently process\
    \ data from multiple handheld devices in real-time as well as provide the generalizable\
    \ application programming interfaces (APIs) to integrate this data pipeline with\
    \ the retail customers. By the end of the Phase I period, the project will have\
    \ piloted the fully-integrated system in a retail store to evaluate its real-world\
    \ performance.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a novel solution for air filter monitoring that will have a positive impact on public health, the environment, and the US economy. The technology is based upon the direct measurement of the filter status using photosensors, smart signal processing algorithms for accurate filter soiling condition determination using the sensor data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for control and communication. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Ambient air pollution kills about 3 million people annually... About 90 percent of the world's population is exposed to levels exceeding WHO limits." While air-filtration technology alone cannot solve the overwhelming problem of ambient air pollution, it must be an integral part of a comprehensive solution. With data driven decision making to eliminate premature filter replacement and to reduce costs, the proposed technology will propel the usage of high-quality filters more ubiquitously, leading to enhanced public health. With 150 million heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in operation, and quarterly filter replacement, an estimated 600 million filters are manufactured and thrown away every year. A reduction of 50% of the filter waste will have a significant positive impact on the environment because of reduced manufacturing and waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage the accuracy of photosensors in detecting the degree of filter blockage by sensing transmitted light through the filter. Underlying the seemingly straightforward solution is a set of complex technical challenges. Due to the uneven structure including pleats and frame obstructions, the sensor data are inherently noisy. A software-controlled actuator will place the sensor in front of the filter and take data from multiple locations of the filter. A smart algorithm will be developed to extract a parameter from the analysis of the data set that would be an accurate proxy for the particle size removal efficiency defined in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard which in turn is expected to be a sufficiently accurate indicator of the true filter age. Using the IoT capability, the sensor data will be collected in the cloud, where the smart algorithm and control software will be stored. The final objective is to determine the optimum point for filter replacement by comparing the parameter with a threshold parameter derived from a predetermined maximum particle size removal efficiency and airflow resistance based on indoor air quality requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to enhance the safety of micro-mobility vehicles and fleets (bicycles, electronic bikes, and electric scooters). Micro-mobility has a high potential to reduce congestion, emissions, and noise pollution in urban settings.  These vehicles can address many first- and last-mile transportation challenges. The technology developed in this project will integrate low-cost sensors, advanced machine learning and model-based algorithms with Internet of Things (IOT)-based technologies for micro-mobility safety devices. Furthermore, IOT-based early detection and warning systems can address safety concerns in the use of micro-mobility, resulting in the development of strong ecosystems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop and evaluate a cost-effective. innovative, IOT technology and turn it into a product and service that are essential to the safety and reliability of the micro-mobility vehicles and fleets. The technology involves predicting likely future failures in vehicle braking components and systems in advance of their occurrence as well as early detection of hazardous driving conditions (due to misbehavior of riders, road conditions, or weather conditions).  The solution will issue warnings to the rider and proactive alerts with actionable recommendations (e.g., for proactive maintenance). The project will develop and evaluate model-based and machine-learning-assisted algorithms for the detection, isolation, and prediction of failures and hazardous driving conditions as well as the associated level of confidence in the accuracy of the decisions. The performance of the safety device and operation under experimental conditions and constraints will be evaluated using end-to-end simulation and a testbed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be low-emissivity windows capable of allowing wireless signals to pass through. Presently, almost all commercial low-emissivity windows severely block mobile signals from entering buildings - a serious problem in today's world that demands fast and uninterrupted mobile connectivity. The proposed low-emissivity windows can be manufactured cost-competitively and significantly reduce the costs of installing indoor cellular aids such as routers and antennas. This technology will accelerate the further adoption of low-emissivity windows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as support the further deployment of 5G technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate scalable manufacturing of mobile, signal transmissive, low-emissivity windows by using lithographic deposition of photoresist structures on the glass substrate prior to low-emissivity vacuum coating. The project proposes to deposit photoresist structures with non-conductive spacers on glass substrate, reducing the low-emissivity coating’s electric conductivity that prevents wireless signal passthrough. Dielectric layers will be deposited over the sidewalls to form protective layers over the low-emissivity coatings to protect against oxidative corrosion. The width of the photoresist structures will range between 2 to 5 micrometers to minimize the degradation of low-emissivity coatings to less than 2%, to maintain thermal performance. After low-emissivity coating deposition, the non-planar spacers will subsequently collapse into the photoresist layer restoring low-emissivity coatings to their original planar position thereby rendering the photoresist structure invisible to the eye. Furthermore, the team will explore additional photoresist designs to address potential lighting diffractions that may form on the finished window.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to a new type of analytical instrument\
    \ and associated businesses, specializing in the identification and characterization\
    \ of chemical isomers and their different conformational forms (conformers). \
    \ Isomers are molecules with the same constituent atoms but arranged differently.\
    \ The identification of isomers and their conformational forms is of critical\
    \ importance to pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries since the metabolites\
    \ of many medications or agrochemical compounds are often isomers of one another.\
    \ Since some of these metabolites may be harmful, safety and efficacy studies\
    \ require careful analytical “method development” work to quantitate their presence\
    \ in clinical samples, soils, and foodstuffs.  Unfortunately, current analytical\
    \ methods for identifying molecular isomers are cumbersome, slow, and involve\
    \ trial and error work – presenting a significant bottleneck to regulatory approval.\
    \  The proposed technology seeks to provide a rapid and robust instrument for\
    \ isomer analysis, dramatically reducing pharmaceutical and agrochemical development\
    \ costs and extending patent exclusivity sales – while enabling the experimental\
    \ identification of conformers for the first time. Access to this new information\
    \ has the potential to transform agrochemical ($220 billion total addressable\
    \ market (TAM) in 2022) and drug discovery ($82 billion TAM 2022) sectors, while\
    \ generating new well-paying, high-tech jobs.\n  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project\
    \ proposes to develop a novel mass spectrometer that works on neutral molecules\
    \ rather than ions.  It uses high electric fields to manipulate and distinguish\
    \ molecules, separating them by the magnitude of their electrical polarity which,\
    \ in turn, is highly sensitive to the molecule’s 3D shape.  Molecules may be pushed\
    \ or pulled by the fields depending on their orientations in the field and the\
    \ magnitude of their polarity (“dipole moment”).  Since molecular isomers weigh\
    \ the same, their identification via mass spectrometry is complicated and typically\
    \ requires time-consuming “method development” work. The proposed instrument aims\
    \ to reduce this work by using dipole moments to distinguish all isomers and their\
    \ conformers in a single spectrum – with an axis labeled by mass-to-dipole-moment\
    \ ratio, rather than mass-to-charge ratio. This technology uses microfabrication\
    \ techniques to miniaturize and planarize a previously demonstrated quadrupole\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop transformative, machine-learning algorithms that will improve water management. Water management is critically important to the social well-being, food supply, and climate resiliency of the local population in the Western United States, yet water managers lack adequate snowpack depth and water content information necessary for the management, storage, and transfer of water for irrigation and consumption. Water deficits are made worse when snowpack depths are in error, potentially resulting in devastating damage to agricultural economies and vulnerable populations. The proposed technology will be able to scale from storm events to seasonal snowpack estimations and provide accurate mappings of snowpack depths and water equivalents for watershed areas needing water management.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops algorithms for determining snowpack depth and water content. Snow retrieval algorithm development has not kept pace with the deployment of short wavelengths.  C- and X-band radars are used as ‘gap-filling’ radars in mountainous valleys. Developing effective algorithms for detection of snow water equivalent is needed for these short wavelength radars. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and optimization algorithms are expected to improve estimation accuracy compared with point-scale (sensor) observations and across watershed areas relevant to water management. Physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) can produce physically consistent results and generalize to out of sample scenarios. Application of a PGNN to snow retrievals is expected to perform better than purely data-driven or deterministic algorithms. Anticipated technical results will provide water managers with a cloud-based subscription service updated in real-time, using historical and current radar data to improve operational decision-making.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase the volume and improve the accuracy of data on the world’s forests. Presently, when collecting data on forests, surveyors must choose between slow, laborious methods, or quick but inaccurate ones. This project uses recent advances in sensors and machine learning to greatly improve data collection speed without sacrificing accuracy. The resulting rich datasets enable the construction of true “digital twins” of forests and open the door for higher fidelity modeling of forest growth trajectories. This information is useful both for timber firms seeking to maximize the potential of their assets and environmental groups projecting how changes today could impact a forest’s performance as a carbon-sink over the long term. The impacts on United States citizens are widespread. Here are two examples: improved efficiency in the timber industry brings down the cost and improves the quality of raw materials and turning forests into denser carbon sinks helps meet climate change goals. The availability of such broad and deep data on forests could also drive a boom in research and understanding about the more complex and nuanced relationships that drive forest health and productivity, launching entirely new sub-industries around forestry.

    The key technological innovations explored in this STTR Phase I project are in constructing the most high-fidelity forest model (digital twin) by combining disparate information sources, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors on backpacks provide high-quality inventory metrics nearly 1000 times faster than manual measurements, but still require someone in the forest to wear the backpack. Satellite imagery scales almost instantly to entire forests and also through time with historical data but is limited by the top-down nature of satellites and the resolution they offer, especially when historical and free data sources are considered. Drone-based imagery sits in-between, with advantages and disadvantages of both. In practice, combining information sources that measure in such different ways can be very difficult. In this project, the team explores how to express LiDAR-based metrics to best associate them with top-down imagery from satellites and drones. From these associations, one can then build powerful machine learning models and specialize them to individual forests. This ability may enable the company to provide forest inventories and forest management recommendations to timber companies at any scale: with satellite imagery only or with a combination of backpack-LiDAR and satellite for the highest accuracy over the entire forest.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ensure the secure transfer of goods and/or passengers in commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and prevent the likelihood of secondary incidents when a commercial motor vehicles (CMV) has made an emergency stop on a highway. All CMVs need to comply with traffic safety regulations and deploy emergency warning devices (e.g., safety triangles) during an emergency stop. Without the presence of a human driver, an automated CMV should also be able to automate emergency warning device placement. Proper placement of these warning devices can be life-saving for drivers of non-automated vehicles on a highway. The proposed project will increase the safety of external drivers by preventing any secondary incidents associated with the lane/shoulder blockage due to a CMV malfunction and protect drivers of non-automated and/or semi-automated vehicles by assisting in the deployment of emergency warning triangles on highways. This project aims to remove barriers to higher-order automated technology adoption due to lack of standardization.

    The project will result in the design, research, and development of an affordable, after-market, reliable, and safe autonomous Warning Triangle System (aWTS) to ensure the safety of the automated and semi-automated commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) during an emergency stop without requiring human assistance. aWTS consists of three low-cost autonomous triangle reflector devices which are planned to optimally fit in a charging dock/enclosure where they will be safely stored during stand-by mode. When activated by the emergency signal transmitted from the CMV, the autonomous triangles are designed to move successively to their pre-determined destinations on the highway. The research and development activity during this Phase I project includes, but is not limited to: reviewing safety codes and regulations, investigating different highway scenarios and associated challenges, and performing computer simulations; developing proof-of-concept hardware that can demonstrate the proposed system’s technical feasibility and its integration to automated CMVs; determining the optimal placement and assembly of the autonomous reflective triangles by collaborating with auto manufacturers; investigating the potential cyber-security risks to develop secure communications between CMV and aWTS; and identifying the operational challenges and the design targets while considering the cost of deployment, lifecycle costs, functional use, and interoperability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project is to provide an in-farm sensing system that will notify sow (adult female swine) farmers of early signs of animal lameness, and thereby reduce early sow mortality and enhance farm productivity. The technology uses artificial intelligence to analyze pig locomotion in order to spot subtle patterns indicative of lameness. Early detection of lameness will enable farmers to take corrective actions rather than waiting for lameness to deteriorate to sow death or culling.  Early culling or sow death is a major economic cost to farmers and a large fraction of death and culls is due to animal lameness.  Successful application of the technology being developed in this project promises to reduce early sow mortality and culling, leading to additional litters per sow and so provide a significant economic boost to farmers.  With patent applications for key components of the sensing system, farmers will install sensors in hallways and obtain health measures for each sow when she moves between rooms. The projected annual revenue is $3.0 million.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes combining an imaging sensor with artificial intelligence to create a unique sensing system to unobtrusively and remotely diagnose lameness in sows (adult female swine) as they traverse hallways.  This project seeks to validate two key technical contributions. First, precise 3D animal posture and locomotion are estimated for sows moving beneath a ceiling-mounted sensor.  High accuracy is achieved through a novel annotation technique that overcomes difficulties in inaccurate manual location of skeletal landmarks.  Second, a data-driven approach is used to train a deep neural network to learn the most discriminating combinations of posture and gait for determining lameness in walking sows.  A self-supervised neural network sidesteps the need for extensive manual annotation and expert annotation is only required for lameness assessment.  Together, these two contributions will enable a transformative technical capability of a remote sensor that can automatically diagnose early-stage lameness in sows.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of instant, remote medical tests for telehealth. This project could develop an accurate machine learning-based predictive model for strep throat. The business model delivers an artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support system as a Software as a Service subscription to urgent care telehealth services. The total addressable market for all telehealth point of care tests (beyond strep throat) in urgent care and primary care is $10.4 billion. This solution impacts antibiotic overprescribing and economics of health services. Currently, 34% of children and 75% of adults with pharyngitis receive unnecessary antibiotics, and this is 10-21% worse with telehealth. A remote point of care prediction for strep throat can potentially reduce the $22 million/year costs in unnecessary antibiotics and reduce drivers for drug-resistant bacteria. When pharyngitis is treated on telehealth it saves patients up to 1-3 hours per clinical visit and saves health insurance companies up to $100-400 per visit, compared to an emergency room or urgent care facility.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the field of machine learning by combining smartphone image analysis and deep learning. These strategies are applied to a novel use case in digital health as remote screening for clinical decision support. The technical challenge is the development of a predictive model to achieve sensitivity and specificity acceptable for clinical adoption, at a target of > 80% (similar to the rapid antigen strep test). The strategy to meet this challenge is to increase the size of the dataset and experiment with multiple prediction models until goal performance is achieved. The project will also include designing an authentication system that validates sufficient images as recorded by an untrained patient and creating an intuitive user interface that enables consistent recordings by patients.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a decrease in the devastating effects of deep implant-related infections.  The technology could result in advances to the clinical health and welfare of the American public by improving clinical outcomes and decreasing morbidity and mortality. The technology addressed by this project may protect surgical implants, such as joint replacements and spinal fusion systems from bacterial colonization and developing infections. This technology could significantly reduce the greater than $3 billion cost to the US healthcare system from implant related infections. This antimicrobial technology could be used beyond medical applications for such things as food packaging to decrease foodborne diseases and more than double shelf-life of certain food products. Additionally, the linker technology developed through this project may be used to create super slick or self-cleaning surfaces with applications in the aerospace and marine industries resulting in increased fuel efficiency and performance.

    The project aims to develop a homogeneous, covalently bound, linker molecule attached to medical implant material (titanium alloy) upon which a quaternary ammonium-modified oligosaccharide will be subsequently attached. Oligosaccharides are known to be biocompatible and quaternized oligosaccharides are highly potent antimicrobials. A treated medical implant could possess a powerfully antimicrobial surface so that, during surgery, any bacteria that encounter the surface will be killed. In this way, it is hoped that the avascular surface of the implant will not serve as a site for biofilm formation and growth and thus, reduce the incidence of perioperative infections. The key to any successful surface modification is the quality of the chemical attachment of linkers and active molecules to that surface. Polyphenols and catechols such as dopamine are ideal candidates for investigation as these molecules are generally known for their facility in forming thin films onto a wide variety of surfaces. Using dopamine as a model system, catechol analogs will be electrochemically attached, and the resulting thin films analyzed for attachment, thickness, ease of further modification, and morphology. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV/Visible spectroscopy, soak/stress protocols and microbiology will be used to gauge the success or failure of a thin film plus oligosaccharide combination.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reimagine bio-manufacturing with a novel platform technology that could boost the yields of many products, including food additives, biomaterials precursors, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. The technological advancement addresses a fundamental issue that limits conventional bio-fermentation, which is that producing cells suffer limited health and viability in exchange for higher yields. In this proposal, genetic tools will be used to divide the labor of cell reproduction and product synthesis into two different cell types, called stem cells and factory cells. As older factory cells become exhausted, productivity is maintained by new factory cells, which are born from the stem cell population. The approach may be particularly well suited to biofuels and other molecules that are difficult to produce in large quantities by conventional bio-fermentation because the product is toxic to the cells that make it. It could be applied toward increasing the profitability of existing bio-processes and also for bringing new products to market, which are currently too difficult to produce. In this project, the team seeks to demonstrate the benefits of producing a fuel (limonene) and a dairy enzyme (chymosin), as proof of its application in biofuel and agricultural sectors. Broad industrial implementation will advance bio-manufacturing toward the ‘green’ revolution, contributing to the development of cleaner industries and decreasing US and global reliance on fossil fuels.

    This project aims to solve two major limitations of microbial fermentation processes: metabolic exhaustion and genetic drift. These are nearly universal problems in the industry. Highly producing cells can become inactive due to the lack of metabolic resources, cytotoxic effects of products, and mutations that break the biosynthetic pathway. In this project, Microbial Stem Cell Technology (MiST) uncouples growth and production by establishing a multicellular system. One cell type is dedicated to product synthesis (factory cells), while another (stem cells) is responsible for cell division and the generation of new factory cells. As older factory cells lose productivity, the bioreactor is continuously replenished with new factory cells, derived from the stem cell population. By maintaining an active factory cell population, MiST-supported cultures are expected to exhibit increased production longevity and higher overall yield than conventional bio-fermentations. This project aims to validate the technology in E. coli engineered to produce limonene, a precursor for biodiesel and other useful chemicals. In the factory cells, T7RNAP will drive high-level expression of a suite of biosynthetic enzymes. Since limonene has a cytotoxic effect on producing cells, MiST-supported factory cell replenishment is expected to increase productivity by more than 2-fold compared to the conventional limonene-producing strains.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable experts in the biomedical field to improve understanding of how new therapeutic approaches are developed and perform in the context of a complex immune system. This technology could enable new therapies to translate to patients faster, at less expense, and with higher rates of success. These therapeutics, such as antibodies, cell and gene therapies, and vaccines, can deliver excellent results when they work, but available therapies do not work for all patients. To develop and deliver the next generation of therapies to improve the lives of patients, investigators need to be able to understand how immune cells and other cells move, interact, kill, and survive over time. This project allows researchers, developers, and manufacturing experts to understand the functional performance of new therapies earlier, more completely, and at lower expense. Such single-cell analysis is a multi-billion market among commercial and non-profit markets.

    The proposed project will develop and rigorously validate a novel array consumable that enables scaling dynamic, single-cell analysis from an early access laboratory to any facility worldwide. Initial design and testing activities for the next generation arrays using non-scalable proof of concept production methodologies have demonstrated the value of the dynamic single-cell functional analysis platform. This project will develop and evaluate two options for producing the arrays, one with an embossing technique and one with a three-dimensional printing technique. Successful completion of this project will support scaling the only platform that can evaluate migration, contact dynamics, killing, survival, subcellular activity, and biomolecule secretion for the same individual cell over time and in high throughput to improve development and delivery of novel therapies faster, with higher rates of success, and at lower expense.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the ability to quickly and inexpensively determine the presence and genetic sequence of a wide variety of pathogenic organisms. Most importantly, this technology could be implemented without prior assumptions as to which organisms are expected. Sequencing will be accomplished by direct electrical identification of the building blocks, the bases, of the genomic sequence. The potential societal impact of this technology is to provide a method to screen individuals quickly (under a minute) for the presence of infections. Screening at ports of entry and in appropriate community settings will minimize disease transmission and allow for the quick identification and treatment of any infected individuals at US borders. In addition, beyond this immediate application, the technology may also enhance scientific understanding of normal genetic sequences in any organism. If its anticipated speed, high accuracy, and low cost are realized, this technology may find applications in human in vitro diagnostics and human genome sequencing. The studies in this Phase I project will lead to a proof-of-concept demonstration for an automated, commercial instrument.

    The project seeks to determine the identity and order of the genetic building blocks, the nucleotide bases, comprising any genomic sequences present in a sample solution. This sequencing will be done by examining the ability of each base in the sequence to modify a tunneling current as it is passed by electrophoresis across two very closely spaced tunneling electrodes. Tunneling is a well-known quantum mechanical effect, and it is quite sensitive to the electrical configuration of the object (here a given specific nucleotide base) present between its electrodes. Experiments with this technology to date have been unsuccessful because genetic sequences have not been able to be moved slowly enough across the tunneling electrodes for their bases to be distinguished. The studies here will overcome this problem by modifications of the geometry and solution conditions of the electrophoresis and possibly with improved methods of tunneling current detection. The data obtained through the application of this technology is expected to enhance the current understanding of nucleotide base chemistry. The solution may permit the detection of nucleotide base modifications of potential biological and medical importance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand access to quality health care for underserved populations.  The proposed project develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant, women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example. The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips. Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules, such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the paper lateral flow strips.

    \ Phase I project is to help restore grassland ecosystems and reduce net greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions from livestock by developing technology to stimulate the herd\
    \ instinct of livestock. Grassland ecosystems have been shown to benefit from\
    \ large herds of animals that promote water absorption and replenish important\
    \ nutrients. However, most livestock in the western United States are currently\
    \ scattered in large pastures and allowed to roam individually.  This project\
    \ aims to develop and test low-cost ear tags which use audio and electrical stimulation\
    \ to reinforce the natural herd instinct of individual animals when they stray\
    \ from the group. High stock density/low duration grazing has demonstrated the\
    \ potential of reducing livestock greenhouse emissions and turning rangelands\
    \ into a net carbon sink. Higher vegetation diversity, more water absorption,\
    \ reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the expected ecological\
    \ benefits of this technology. This technology could also facilitate more efficient\
    \ and cost-effective ranch management. The risk of livestock theft will be reduced,\
    \ and the need for fences would decrease since the migratory instincts of livestock\
    \ work best on larger land areas. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will develop and\
    \ test a novel approach of stimulating the herd instinct of livestock rather than\
    \ geographically confining them. Key to the implementation of this approach is\
    \ the additional innovation of a unique and low-cost strategy to use ear tags\
    \ with low-power radiofrequency (RF) transceivers to calculate herd proximity\
    \ from an accumulation of individual distance estimates. This technology will\
    \ use a highly integrated system using an ear tag attached to each animal in the\
    \ herd. Each tag will use a low power RF transceiver to periodically send brief\
    \ signals to the other tags in the herd. The tags will use signal strength measurements\
    \ to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will\
    \ then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity\
    \ to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag\
    \ will give an audio alert potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage\
    \ the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density\
    \ from 10,000 to 1,000,000 pounds per acre will be a key metric of success.\n\n\
    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support\
    \ through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to improve education and experiential learning.  The proposed tool will support both synchronous and asynchronous learning while providing students with the opportunity to engage independently and connect their learning to internships, job shadows, service projects, and other real-world learning experiences. This project will enhance teacher capacity to guide and assess student learning, increase transparency and objectivity in assessment, and expand the learning ecosystem of schools by empowering students to engage in and validate authentic, real-world learning experience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel competency-based evaluation tool and learner recommendation engine designed to: assess a range of currently needed skills and competencies, aggregate assessment data for the purpose of generating a comprehensive learner record in real time, and generate personalized competency pathways and recommendations for learning and growth. The key intellectual merits of this proposal are the formulas used to aggregate assessment data over time and the algorithms used to generate personalized competency pathways and learner recommendations. The technical challenges are the development and testing of the associated algorithms to guide and evaluate learning in both academic and authentic, real-world contexts. Research conducted during this Phase I project enable testing and refining of the data aggregation formulas utilized by the assessment tool, as well as optimization of the learner recommendation algorithms used for the creation of personalized competency pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing much-needed decision-support\
    \ tool to progress the United States towards a net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions\
    \ economy. The Princeton Net Zero America study suggests that a of minimum 0.9\
    \ gigatons /year of CO2 sequestration is required to transition the country to\
    \ a net-zero economy, which is 1.3 times larger than the country’s oil production\
    \ on a volume-equivalent basis. One of the many substantial challenges to achieving\
    \ this feat is identifying and profiling capturable CO2 streams from emitters\
    \ across the United States. Software that could robustly address this challenge\
    \ would provide benefits to society and the country. For example, climate change\
    \ is recognized as the largest threat facing humanity and the security of the\
    \ United States; Transitioning the US economy to net-zero CO2 emissions is one\
    \ of the largest wealth creation opportunities of our generation. \n\nThe proposed\
    \ CO2 National Capture Opportunities and Readiness Data software will enable users\
    \ to identify sources of CO2 (e.g., cement manufacturers and ethanol refineries)\
    \ that could be profitably turned into carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)\
    \ projects. The database would provide the break-even CO2 capture cost, technology\
    \ readiness level (TRL), and lifecycle CO2 emissions of any prospective CCS project\
    \ across the country by integrating the latest public data and scientific research\
    \ into a single end-user platform.  A novel integration of advances in multiple\
    \ disciplines is required for successful project completion: 1) big data fusion,\
    \ 2) CO2 capture stream characterization, 3) lifecycle assessment, 4) advanced\
    \ techno-economic assessments, and 5) software engineering. Additionally, this\
    \ project will also advance the status-quo by creating dynamic results that can\
