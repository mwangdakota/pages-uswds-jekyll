    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop a higher power light source for wireless infrastructure links of high power and high speed. Typically, these links depend on mechanical alignment, presenting challenges such as a large form factor, increased use of power, and slow response. The proposed project will use non-mechanical methods to steer a beam.  This development of these light sources will enable optical wireless links that are both easier to align and more stable, thus representing an important and inexpensive source for future high-speed links.

    This Phase I project advances a novel compound semiconductor laser array integrated with a high-speed electrical waveguide and integrated micro-optical lenses on the back side of the chip to sum beams into an overlap intensity profile. This low coherent source can be designed to increase power out without a penalty in frequency response. The proposed project enables non-mechanical beam steering using an array of array; the device will direct the beam using a routing technique with passive optical offsets. Efforts will be to understand and design optical intensity profiles in the far field and develop the capability to non-mechanically switch or sequence the arrays to move the data beam, to auto-align the beam's fine tuning. Optical modeling of the micro-optical lens arrays on the opposite side of a back-emitter laser array structure will enable understanding the light intensity and bit error rate uniformity fields at the collector. The design process will optimize overlap areas in the near field where uniform intensity is critical for projecting into the far field for collector stability.  These devices could yield high-speed LiFi emitters ideal for wireless links, either for long distance or point-to-multipoint connections.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a foundation for unified secure sensing and communication for next generation wireless infrastructure. To ensure the safety and security of scalable commercial drone usage and autonomous driving, a sensor infrastructure is needed to detect, track, and identify fast moving vehicles in urban environments. Existing commercial radars developed for defense applications do not scale for the massive deployment of emerging civilian operation environments. Aura’s digital imaging radar addresses problems that plague the existing radars and offers a solution for this critical infrastructure need. Commercial opportunities include infrastructure security and automation providing situational awareness around airports and industrial sites and next generation wireless infrastructure for unmanned traffic management and connected autonomous vehicles. The technology has the potential to enable new services by integration into vehicles for vehicle safety and autonomous driving.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a real-time system design and simulation platform for novel digital imaging radar. Aura has developed an all digital imaging radar technology for smart infrastructure for autonomous vehicles and unmanned traffic management. Unlike conventional radars relying on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) waveform or phase modulation (PM), Aura develops time- frequency MIMO radar technology leveraging standard 5G component technology. Aura’s technology provides agile and secure waveform with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), addressing the operational challenges due to interference, jamming, and energy efficiency. Key challenges for commercialization of this digital radar are system complexity due to wideband data converters and real-time baseband processing. The goals of Phase I project are to complete low-complexity, real-time system design and to validate the performance of the proposed technology in realistic channel environments. Scientific tasks that will be completed in Phase I project include a low complexity system design architecture for real-time implementation of the end-to-end simulation platform with a realistic channel model for performance characterization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a fast, non-invasive, and highly accurate test to diagnose pulmonary embolism in the emergency department. In the United States, pulmonary embolism (PE) affects up to 1 million patients per year and is responsible for nearly 100,000 yearly deaths. Its diagnosis is challenging due to the presentation of nonspecific symptoms and the lack of high-accuracy screening methods. While the current standard of care is to rule out PE with an established blood test (D-Dimer), approximately 90% of those results are false positives, causing the test to be used with restraint in the clinic, and leading to both the underdiagnosis of the disease and the overuse of strongly radiative imaging methods like CT pulmonary angiograms. A new, highly specific test for PE could increase patient safety, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and validate a new diagnostic tool for PE based on the combination of fast blood spectroscopy and modern machine learning (ML) algorithms. A key aim of the research is demonstrating that ML combined with blood spectroscopy can substantially outperform the D-Dimer biomarker test, which has notoriously low specificity (~40%).  An important Phase I milestone will be to show that the specificity of the resulting PE test either (a) already surpasses that of the D-Dimer test when trained on the relatively small dataset used in this Phase I proposal, or (b) substantially increases with the size of the training dataset, so that the test can outperform D-Dimer simply by procuring a larger pool of blood samples. The technical challenges addressed in this phase include evaluating different spectroscopic methods and modalities, minimizing the coefficient of variation for spectra acquisition, as well as designing and optimizing ML models for one-dimensional spectral data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project to develop a portable chip-based diagnostic device to detect the biomarker troponin T in human blood for cardiac disease diagnosis. This nano-biosensor has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Many patients who experience chest pain, an early symptom of a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI), are first seen by EMS (emergency medical services) and are transported to a hospital in an ambulance. EMS are equipped with electrocardiogram (EKG) devices, but approximately 40% of all heart attacks cannot be diagnosed with an EKG alone. This leads to longer wait times for a definitive diagnosis, causes difficulty for patient transport decisions, delays treatment for those experiencing a true MI, and causes unnecessary hospital admissions for patients who are later found not to have had a heart attack. Blood-based biomarker assays, which are currently not performed in a prehospital setting, are needed to reach a conclusive diagnosis for all heart attack types. A portable device to monitor troponin T in a prehospital setting would result in faster treatment via improved diagnosis, better routing of patients to appropriate medical centers, and a decrease in unnecessary hospital stays. The cardiac biomarker market, including troponin, is expected to grow to $9.9 billion by 2022.

    The innovation of the proposed technology lies in the metal nanostructures on the diagnostic chip. These nanostructures allow proteins to be delivered to the sensing area and detected in a high sensitivity manner, while excluding larger debris, such as blood cells. The proposed work will leverage optical techniques for real-time label-free detection of protein biomarkers at the nanostructured chip. The current method for manufacturing the detection chips is slow and uneconomical. This Phase I work will address the high-risk, high-reward technical challenges by creating a low-cost, high-throughput fabrication method to mass manufacture nanostructured chips with reproducible optical properties. Additionally, this Phase I work seeks to validate blood sample delivery to the sensing area and troponin T detection in blood using an integrated microfluidic device. The selectivity and specificity requirements will be addressed by attachment of custom DNA molecules to the sensing area. These pieces of DNA are designed to bind in a highly specific manner to troponin T only. The outcomes of this Phase I project will establish the scientific and technical foundations necessary to move into a Phase II project by developing a low cost and easy to use point-of-care device suitable for rapid prehospital diagnosis of heart attacks.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the stable and persistent modulation of microbiomes – the community of microorganisms that populate the different regions of a person’s body. All organisms have an associated microbiota that play an intimate role in that organism’s growth, health, immunity, and stress tolerance. Current approaches for modulating the microbiome, including the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and other living therapeutics, lack a demonstrated ability to induce long-term changes in the microbiota. In contrast, this project uses bacteriophages—viruses that infect bacteria but do not affect the human host—for long-term or permanent alteration of resident bacterial members of the microbiome. As a proof of concept, initial development will focus on altering human gut microbes to treat gluten-related disorders, ranging from mild gluten sensitivity to celiac disease. Ultimately, this technology could be adapted to address a vast number of microbiome-related issues that span a wide range of clinical, commercial, and societal interests. Potential health applications include microbiome-related conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, gingivitis and caries, multiple types of cancer, skin disorders, and recurrent bacterial infections. Other potential applications include agricultural and environmental fields.

    The proposed project will exploit the utility and power of bacteriophages to transduce genetic information. As engineering bacteriophages to modulate the microbiome has not yet been attempted beyond preliminary proof-of-concept experiments, establishment of the proposed microbial gene therapy platform will require research and development efforts to overcome numerous technical challenges. The objectives of this project include: 1) engineering Bifidobacterium-targeting temperate bacteriophage capable of infecting B. longum to express a gluten-degrading enzyme from Sphingomonas capsulata and 2) introducing the glutenase-expressing phage into a B. longum in vitro biofilm model. This project will result in enhanced knowledge of bacteriophage–host interactions, genetic circuit modulation, and management of horizontal gene transfer, which will have far-reaching implications for innovation in the fields of applied virology, genetic engineering, and microbiomics. In particular, the ultimate success of this project will rely upon the use and development of synthetic biological approaches to enhance bacteriophage capabilities, such as flexibly integrating and excising genes from host genomes, managing intra-host expression, converting phages between lifestyles (e.g. lytic to lysogenic and back), expanding phage host range, and neutralizing bacterial host defense systems.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safer, faster, and more cost-effective
    solution for hysterectomy. In the US, approximately 500,000 hysterectomies are
    performed per year, typically for uterine enlargement as a result of fibroids.
    There is an urgent need for an improved solution in approximately 30% of these
    cases involving significantly enlarged uteri. Currently the gold standard for
    hysterectomy, contained manual morcellation, is an off-label technique, which
    is slow (10 or more scalpel blades and 20-40 minutes), and ineffective at containing
    potentially cancerous cells (8-41% documented container breaches). An alternative,
    open surgery, is costly and has high morbidity / mortality (1:5000 mortality,
    1:20 serious complications), with additional complications in underserved populations.
    The proposed project will develop an improved tissue extraction solution to increase
    patient safety for all communities and reduce associated health care costs. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project carries out fundamental
    materials, manufacturing process and systems integration research as a foundation
    for development of a novel minimally invasive hysterectomy toolset. The ultimate
    goal of the research is to enable a hysterectomy tissue extraction system that:
    1) lowers the risk of cancer spread and reduces morbidity and mortality during
    minimally invasive surgery; 2) saves 20-40 minutes of operative time out of a
    2-hour procedure; 3) enables conversion of open hysterectomies to minimally invasive
    surgeries–reducing healthcare costs by thousands of dollars per patient. This
    Phase I project will develop and rigorously evaluate a novel technical solution
    to the surgical challenge of removing a large tissue mass from the body safely
    and as non-invasively as possible. The innovations developed in this Phase I project
    are applicable to numerous procedures besides hysterectomy (including myomectomy,
    oophorectomy and others) and have the potential to broadly impact how minimally
    invasive tissue extraction is performed across surgical fields.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a widely available blood test to determine the level of immune protection toward COVID-19 infection in previously uninfected persons. As many as two-thirds of unexposed individuals could be naturally immune due to prior exposure to structurally similar coronaviruses that cause flu-like illness. This information is especially informative for vulnerable populations with advanced age and underlying chronic disease.  Antibodies only occur after exposure to the virus, and have been seen in less than one-third of tested individuals. This project will advance tests to identify individuals who potentially have this natural immunity, potentially lessening the severity of social distancing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will refine the applicant’s blood test for cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to SARS-CoV-2 for widespread use. Preliminary studies suggest that cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to SARS-COV-2 could be present in over half of unexposed individuals. This project will create user-friendly test formats for rapid and widespread use using major classes of cytometers. The technical refinements to be developed and tested in this project will include pre-fabricated assays in solid phase which can be read on major classes of reference-lab-based and portable cytometers, and capabilities for direct testing of unmodified blood samples. The objective is to advance standardized kits for liquid phase assays, and pre-fabricated solid-phase assay tubes with minimal manual steps for use on the most common reference-lab-based, semi-portable and portable cytometers, closer to the point of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is in the development of a low-cost, high sensitivity sensor to measure contaminants in groundwater. These measurements are currently performed using technologies that are relatively expensive ($250-300 per water sample) and have a long turn-around time (10-15 business days). The proposed on-site optical detection technology targets a 10-fold reduction in test price ($20-30 per water sample), and fast detection time (<10 minutes). The proposed sensor will possess the following advanced attributes: high sensitivity, high specificity, fast detection, ease of operation, low power consumption, zero chemical release, low operational cost, remote measurements, and long-term stability without the need for recalibration. Moreover, direct use of the sample water will potentially eliminate uncertainties associated with measurement techniques.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward development of a powerful on-site detection and monitoring system for trace levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater. The proposed technology uses fluorescence quenching induced phase shift. A fluorescent material with PFAS molecule binding sites will be fabricated and its PFAS-induced fluorescence quenching will be experimentally evaluated. Using phase fluorometry, the phase shift of quenched emissions against excitation pulses will be recorded and correlated to the concentration of PFAS in water. The key technical risks lie in improving sensitivity by three orders of magnitude for a complex aqueous sample.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of energy efficient building coatings that have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The market for energy efficient coatings is experiencing accelerated growth due to government and rapid rise in demand for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified structures. With these recent developments, building developers are actively seeking solutions which are technologically robust and cost-effective for meeting energy mandates. These novel architectural coatings not only provide the aesthetics and textured finish as traditional architectural coatings, but also provide the added benefit of decreasing heating and cooling related costs for the building owner.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing an optimized blend of phase change materials for incorporation in architectural building envelope coatings such as paint, plaster and stucco, to provide them with insulative properties. The optimized blend will consist of phase change materials (PCMs) with different phase transition temperatures in specific volume proportions to maximize energy savings in a specific climate zone in terms of heating and cooling costs. Preliminary lab work has shown promise that PCMs can be utilized in coatings to reduce temperature swings and shift the peak load to off-peak hours, which can lead to significant cost savings.  This project will develop protocols to maximize incorporation of PCMs in these coatings without compromising their aesthetics. Energy modeling and experimental work including micro- and macro- scale material characterization will be carried out to verify the laboratory and small field-scale performance of these coatings.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to improve manufacturing technology for the purification
    of monoclonal antibodies, which are important therapeutics as well as valuable
    tools in research and diagnostics. Approximately four new antibody drugs are approved
    every year, and while they can have tremendous clinical outcomes and are sometimes
    heralded as \"magic bullets,\" they often come with a significant price tag. This
    puts a strain on patients and insurance companies, limiting the accessibility
    of antibody-based drugs. Furthermore, antibodies are critical research tools that
    enhance the understanding of biology. The technology developed in this research
    project will provide a completely novel method for the purification of antibodies
    from cell culture that will lower cost, increase manufacturing throughput, and
    accelerate the time to market for new therapeutics. Commercially, this technology
    will disrupt the current gold standard - Protein A resin - making antibody purification
    simpler, faster, and cheaper at all scales: research, clinical, and industrial.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop technology
    for improved purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Although upstream production
    of antibodies in cell culture has improved dramatically, downstream purification
    has not kept pace, resulting in a production bottleneck and a major market opportunity.
    The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to demonstrate technical and commercial
    feasibility of a new technology that combines affinity with liquid-liquid phase
    separation to separate antibodies from cell culture contaminants. It involves
    an antibody-binding domain fused to a biopolymer with stimulus responsive phase
    behavior. When this fusion protein is added to cell culture harvest, it binds
    the antibody and, after triggering the phase separation with salt, pulls the antibody
    out of solution. The purified antibody can then be eluted from the fusion by lowering
    the pH. This project aims to 1) optimize regeneration conditions so that the fusion
    can be reused, 2) evaluate long-term stability, and 3) validate the technology
    at scale and conduct a head-to-head comparison to the industry gold standard,
    Protein A resin. The goal is to identify storage conditions that provide a long
    shelf life for a product that can be reused 10-100 times without compromising
    antibody yield or purity. The focus of the project is to demonstrate promising
    capabilities of the technology for use in industrially manufactured monoclonal
    antibodies, replacing conventional chromatography steps with a simpler and more
    cost-effective method.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve efficiency in the shipping industry.
    Biofouling, or surface contamination on ships, increases drag and consequently
    makes travel inefficient. This project will develop an underwater robotic system
    that performs automated ship hull inspections and cleaning, increasing fuel efficiency
    by 10 percent and subsequently saving a container vessel $2 million annually.
    \ An automated cleaning solution improves safety and minimizes expensive human

    ship hull inspection and cleaning vehicle. This Phase 1 project will develop a
    low-cost sensor architecture and localization algorithm that can reliably place
    the vehicle on the hull. To date, there has been progress on large human-deployable
    robotic cleaning vehicles that can be an alternative to diver operations. However,
    these vehicles must be used at or close to a port, have complex filtration systems,

    of 0.25 m/s will be developed to test sensors for this application. Sensors identified
    as complementary and reliable will be integrated to position the vehicle on the
    hull using a probabilistic estimator. To ensure the vehicle optimizes its energy
    usage when submerged in a high drag environment, a key metric of success will
    be to accurately position the vehicle within 3 meters on the ship hull 95 percent

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address challenges with enduring low operating margins and plant inefficiencies across many application areas. Recovering low-grade waste heat is often a technically impractical and cost-prohibitive process. The proposed technology is designed to offset operating costs and increase overall plant efficiency. Target users for the thermal energy-harvesting system are owners/operators of combined heat and power (CHP) installations, metal manufacturers, chemical processors, industrial boilers, and other industrial facilities currently unable to recover the substantial amounts of low-grade waste heat that their facilities generate. The technology would potentially offer these applications reduced operating costs, reduced energy demands, and improved sustainability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the translation of porous Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) materials as actuators. The innovation will be an SMA actuator comprised of a novel, porous SMA material operating in a compact rotary form. The porous material's small feature size will allow for fast heat transfer and phase transformation, compared to solid SMA actuators. This novel actuator is expected to result in the recovery of substantially more power from the same mass of SMA material. The proposed Phase I proof-of-concept work will produce validated models of the overall SMA behavior and its coupled behavior in a system, including heat transfer, thermo-mechanical behavior, and localized stresses. In addition to the improved models, the proposed work will focus on reliability for translation of porous SMA materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be an affordable, portable breath analysis device to detect marijuana intoxication. First responders, law enforcement, medical professionals, cannabis users, and the general public will benefit from an analytical tool that allows fast and accurate screenings of cannabis impairment. An estimated 37,000 people died in vehicle crashes in 2016; 54% of the victims were tested for drugs and alcohol, and 38% of those tested positive for marijuana. The proposed device will enable objective determination of cannabis impairment, improving road safety.

    The proposed project is based on engineering detectable, reproducible interactions between an array of biomimetic polymer coatings trained to detect gas-phase molecular components that are markers of cannabis intoxication. Drawing inspiration from the principles and chemical features of nature’s cannabinoid receptors, polymers will be molecularly engineered for enhanced molecular recognition of cannabinoids. These materials will be rationally designed to strongly bind cannabinoids and create changes measurable with Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) sensors, while simultaneously affording a functional handle that can be utilized to monitor gas-phase cannabinoids in real-time. The biomimetic polymers will be solution-deposited onto MEMS sensors and evaluated in a controlled environmental chamber for responsiveness to a panel of cannabinoids. Volatilized gas-phase cannabinoid concentrations will be screened, mapped against MEMS resistance and capacitance measurements, and analyzed to develop proprietary chemometric pattern recognition algorithms that uniquely identify each molecular target. The simultaneous use of chemicapacitive and chemiresistive MEMS sensors coupled with multiple molecular recognition strategies will be exploited to enhance the sensor’s molecular discriminating power, adding signal diversity across the sensor array. This approach will distinguish gas-phase cannabinoids in breath via chemometric “fingerprints” across a diversified biomimetic MEMS sensor array.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to leverage architecture as a new tool for advancing health and wellbeing. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital architecture systemically affects patient health, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. However, architects often lack the tools to reliably predict how design choices will impact building operations.   Often hospitals and clinics designs fall short with building owners not able to achieve organizational metrics and goals, and patients can see poorer quality of care, increased medical errors, and even higher mortality rates.  The commercial impact will stem from a software platform that equips architects with no-code workflows necessary to deploy data-driven design while managing project timelines and internal costs. Although the Phase I project focuses on healthcare architecture, the broader impact will be that architects will be able to design all buildings to optimize health, productivity, and organizational goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of 1) algorithms that generate structured architectural data capturing spatial qualities that affect occupant health, 2) data visualization interfaces for exploring and validating spatial data and health data jointly, and 3) statistical and machine learning models for identifying meaningful relationships between architectural characteristics and health outcomes across large-scale datasets. These tools will be tested and evaluated by conducting a proof of concept study with a large health system. The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of untested statistical machine learning methods to identify meaningful relationships between architecture and health outcomes. The proposed research will provide new types of insight into architecture's role in affecting health outcomes, providing a novel approach to data-driven design. Though the focus of this proposal is on architectural data, the principles explored will push boundaries of current limits by 1) incorporating qualitative and quantitative data in machine learning models, 2) assessing new modes of interpretability via data visualization, and 3) advancing methods for working with sparse but rich datasets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccine for COVID-19. The fastest-to-clinic vaccine for COVID-19 was mRNA-based; however, there are no mRNA-based vaccines on the market currently. This is, in part, because this class of vaccines is difficult to optimize and manufacture at a large scale. If clinical trials are successful, hundreds of millions of doses will be needed in the U.S. alone. This STTR project aims to pioneer a novel technique to manufacture mRNA-based vaccines initially for COVID-19. This technology is highly modular, allowing for the better understanding and optimization of this class of vaccines. Importantly, this new technique can be scaled to manufacture the doses needed both for the current COVID-19 pandemic and in the case of future outbreaks. The flexibility and scalability of this platform technology provide a durable competitive advantage. Following demonstration of preclinical efficacy, the company will work with an established pharmaceutical partner for testing and manufacturing. Capturing 5% of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine market would bring an estimated $125 million in revenue. This is a beachhead market, and, once successful, the company will expand into other mRNA-based vaccine and therapeutic markets.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop an mRNA-based nanoparticle vaccine for COVID-19 without the use of cationic materials. Current formulation methods require cationic lipids or polymers to form charge-based complexes with the anionic mRNA. Charge-based assembly limits the accessible nanoparticle surface chemistries, a feature crucial to directing which cell types will be transfected and the resulting immune response. Additionally, mRNA is only a minor component of the resulting formulations. The proposed formulation method decouples the mRNA encapsulation from the nanoparticle surface in a two-step process. The method does not require cationic materials, allowing for mRNA loadings up to 5-times higher than those achievable through other routes. However, mRNA transfection has not previously been demonstrated without the use of cationic materials. This will be achieved by completing three key milestones: (1) optimize mRNA encapsulation, (2) vary surface coatings to enhance dendritic cell uptake, and (3) demonstrate efficient cell transfection. A highly loaded nanoparticle formulation that can efficiently target and transfect dendritic cells is desired. Following the completion of this Phase I work, this formulation may be applied to a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-coding mRNA to produce a COVID-19 vaccine.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes the ability to eliminate two of the primary
    barriers in dealing with seniors and technology: user interfaces and internet
    availability. The  approach makes use of recent (2019) national network coverage
    for Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) enabling low power, low cost access
    for direct to cellular low bandwidth applications. The auto pairing direct to
    cellular gateway provides COVID-19 diagnosed patients with the capability to effectively
    monitor symptoms from home resulting in improved disease impact tracking and monitoring
    adherence while reducing hospital demand, disease spread, and system costs over
    current smart phone-based system. Current systems require lengthy user training
    and account setup as well as cumbersome measurement data transfers using an app
    during each reading. This currently challenging interface would be replaced with
    a single device requiring no set up or direct interaction with the user. The approach
    greatly simplifies and streamlines the disease related measurements while reducing
    the time and cost of getting devices provisioned and into the end users’ hands.
    \ Although focused on COVID-19 monitoring, the technology also provides broad
    application for effective telemedicine adoption by seniors for chronic care monitoring.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to provide
    a solution which is more cost effective and enables greater adoption and compliance
    for long-term, in-home, self-monitoring of seniors and at-risk populations diagnosed
    with COVID-19. The research goals of this project include demonstrating an auto
    pairing direct to cellular device that meets the requirements for COVID-19 monitoring
    under the global COVID-19 Emergency Response Solution. The research approach includes:
    demonstrating a design with optimized narrow band performance; demonstrating FCC/IC
    end unit certification; and demonstrating testing required for network certifications.
    \ The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project enable smartphone-based
    monitoring systems and a gateway into senior populations for chronic care monitoring.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project may lead to an innovative self-defense wristband so that users will not have to remember to carry additional items. The potential users may already be wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc. This device will address the limitations of current devices, which include: charging a separate device, placing a device in the current purse or grabbing it before leaving the house, being alert when walking around, fumbling for a device if attacked, remembering how to use a security device, pointing the device in the right direction, or activating the device in a surprise attack.  The wristband will sense the user struggling and activate automatically. The wearable self-defense wristband will benefit current self-defense product owners, college students, concerned spouses and family members, people who exercise or work alone. etc.. The goal of this project is to enable self-protection for the public and achieve swift and sustained support.  It is anticipated that the wearable, threat-protection product could deter 1 million attacks by 2030.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first Internet of Things (IoT), hands-free, and wrist-worn self-defense device. The device will be motion-activated. A gyro/accelerometer will be programmed to activate defense features when the correct motion is applied.  This wearable self-defense device will be easy and quick to activate, reliable to respond, safe to use, and comfortable for the wearer, as well as aesthetically pleasing. For the Phase I project, the features that will be enabled in the self-defense wristband include a siren, a strobe light, and a GPS ping to designated contacts and/or a 24/7 security firm that will call the user back and call emergency responders, if needed. The key technical hurdles are combining all targeted features in one compact device, while triggering the self-defense wristband consistently and safely.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide U.S. hospitals with a tool to help accurately predict the expected severity of illness for COVID-19 infected patients at the time of initial diagnosis. A simple interface uses Artificial Intelligence-based predictive algorithms to help hospitals make informed and accurate decisions about which patients require specific care and treatment interventions. This enhanced process allows hospitals better and faster decision-making on patient care and treatments, redirecting hospital resources (including staff, hospital beds, ICU) for maximum effectiveness. In the longer term, the platform can be adapted to predict illnesses related to other infectious diseases, and also scaled for countries where availability of hospital infrastructure is limited.

    This Small Business Technology (STTR) Phase I project will develop a completely new category of medical diagnostic and prognostic tools via a novel approach that relies on analysis of a complex multi-variate signal, reflective of the patient’s entire salivary metabolome and proteome. Artificial intelligence tools will be used to see if signal clusters correlating with patient outcomes can be identified. This is a radical departure from traditional medical diagnostics which evaluate individual biomarkers for a clinical diagnosis. Such approaches are ill suited to the task of predicting future patient outcomes. The scope of this pilot phase work is the development of an effective algorithm and understanding algorithm efficacy and reliability in prediction and classification of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The goals of the pilot project are to: (i) obtain COVID-19 patient bio-fluid samples, and (ii) develop machine learning techniques for an effective predictive algorithm. Multiple machine learning techniques and comparison strategies will be used for algorithm development and efficacy testing.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a wound care product to heal bed sores or pressure ulcers (PUs). Over 2.5 million Americans, usually older adults, suffer from PUs annually. PUs can be deep wounds, take many months to heal, cause significant pain; if infected, they can lead to sepsis and death. The annual U.S. cost for treatment of all PUs is estimated to be greater than $11 billion. Current treatment options involve surgical reconstruction with skin or skin substitute grafts, which can fail to heal the pressure ulcer because of infection or because the graft was not strong enough. To address these issues, the proposed project will develop a novel skin substitute that is pro-regenerative, stronger, and releases infection-fighting drugs at the surgical site to allow healing. This could benefit physicians and hospitals treating patients with stage II-III PUs (58% of all PUs); the 3-year market potential is over $150 million. The underlying technology of the proposed solution can be used to make novel grafts for treatment of numerous wound types, improving healing and patient quality of life.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of this drug-loaded, polymer-impregnated acellular biologic graft (ABG) platform technology. Currently, PUs are surgically reconstructed using skin or skin substitute grafts, like ABGs, which often fail due to infection or lack of mechanical strength. By embedding a polymer hydrogel within an ABG, it can be mechanically strengthened. Furthermore, mixing the polymer with drugs (drug+polyABG) enables a drug delivery system that provides sustained, local release of therapeutic agents such as anti-infectives over a 14-day period. This novel approach simultaneously provides an allogeneic scaffold for patient-mediated tissue regeneration and counters onset of common complications during wound healing. This biocompatible polymer impregnation of ABGs for therapeutic applications has not been performed previously. This Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility drug+polyABG by (1) characterizing drug release and bioactivity in vitro and (2) assessing efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of single-stage reconstruction of stage II-III PUs challenged with topical MRSA.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a quick, cost-effective, and sensitive
    early detection assay for Huanglongbing (HLB) disease (aka citrus greening disease)
    to guide management strategies and limit its spread. HLB is the most impactful
    and devastating disease plaguing the global citrus industry.  Current diagnostic
    tools are either unreliable for early detection or infeasible to scale; they are
    hindered by time-consuming sample preparation, delayed result reporting, and high
    operation costs. The lack of technology to detect the presence of the HLB disease-causing
    bacterium at an early stage and diagnose HLB with minimal sampling has contributed
    to inadequate disease control. Consequences include a 60% decline in citriculture
    acreage and a 72% reduction in oranges for processing, a threefold increase in
    citrus farming expenses, and costs in the US of $11 B annually. This technology
    will provide a new diagnostic tool for rapid detection and precise, defensive
    management of citrus crops with respect to HLB.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project
    will address the critical need for a highly sensitive early-detection assay for
    HLB, a major threat to the citrus industry, to support effective disease management.
    Currently, HLB is primarily detected by a PCR assay for the pathogen itself. The
    assay is frequently ineffective, as the titer and distribution of HLB-associated
    bacteria within citrus trees, the types of tissue infected, and degree of disease
    progression are highly variable. Development of new diagnostic tools to detect
    infection prior to symptom development and independent of direct pathogen presence
    is crucial. This project will combine two innovations, small non-coding RNA biomarkers
    associated with the host tree instead of the pathogen, and a novel RNA amplification
    methodology, to develop a 30-minute assay performed in a single step, with the
    capability of detecting infection by HLB-causing bacteria at 10 weeks post-inoculation
    with over 80% specificity and sensitivity. The Phase I project will 1) demonstrate
    feasibility of using a novel amplification technology to detect an RNA biomarker
    panel in infected tree samples; 2) validate assay performance, and 3) compare
    the assay to traditional methods.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve dental care and cavity prevention. Oral health maladies have been referred to by the Surgeon General as America’s silent epidemic, and caries disease (tooth decay) is the single largest disease in the world. Current care models are failing because they reactively focus on treatment instead of prevention, although acidity is recognized as the driving factor behind tooth decay. High-risk patients often spend over $10,000 annually, with the highest-risk patients experiencing bills of over $100,000 for comprehensive dental care. This project will advance an Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology to measure mouth conditions for preventive dental care.  The proposed sensor will continually measure and transmit real-time oral pH data to a mobile application on the user’s smartphone. Dentists will also have access to long-term patient data at checkups. The technology will mitigate or eliminate expensive cavity-related health complications, which may be beneficial for disadvantaged and high-risk patients. In the longer term, saliva can be used as a non-invasive way to detect a range of biomarkers, such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, antibodies, DNA, as well as therapeutic drugs or allergens. The proposed technology will enable the collection of new amounts of health-related data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project aims to develop a novel, intraoral IoT sensor for dental caries preventive care. When prolonged periods of unhealthy pH levels are identified, the user will be provided with a specific product recommendation to effectively prevent the progression of dental caries. The objectives of the proposed Phase I project are to fully miniaturize the electronic system (power supply, CPU, bluetooth antenna, signal conditioning) to comfortably fit around one molar, and minimize both signal drift and biofouling impacts on the ion sensitive field effect transistor pH sensor such that a reliable signal can be produced continually for one week without calibration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide waste concrete as a new raw material source for the glass and other industries.  It is estimated that 2.2 billion tons of waste concrete is generated globally each year.  About 70% of the construction waste generated in the US is concrete, but it is not typically used as a raw material for glass production or other chemical processes.  Using concrete as a raw material reduces its contribution to landfills as well as the need for mining virgin raw materials., and contributes environmental benefits.  This STTR Phase I project will study processes to prepare furnace-ready concrete for glass production.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the feasibility of waste concrete as a raw material constituent (feedstock) for calcium-silicate glass and glass-making.  Environmental benefits are possible because concrete contains the same key oxides used in glass making (silicon, calcium, aluminum and iron oxides) as well as sulfur compounds (e.g. gypsum mixed with the cement to regulate setting, and therefore can potentially serve as a candidate raw material in the production of calcium-silicate soda lime and calcium-borosilicate glasses.Research objectives include: 1) characterize variations in chemical composition from industrially relevant sources; 2) determine variation in contaminant concentrations; 3) demonstrate processes and methods to address contaminant variations' 4) characterize the specifications for a furnace-ready waste concrete glass batch; 5) produce pilot batches of calcium-silicate soda lime glass; and 6) characterize variations in produced glasses.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enhance technological understanding of Asymmetric
    Propulsion, which will in turn enhance scientific understanding of the oceans.
    Asymmetric Propulsion uses a single-bladed propeller to both move and steer an
    Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In addition to eliminating the need for control
    fins, reducing cost and complexity, and increasing efficiency, it can also allow
    AUVs to hold station over objects of interest. This capability has numerous scientific,
    military, and commercial applications because it allows the same robot to perform
    large-area surveys and then hold station over specific objects and perform close-up
    inspections. Such missions currently require multiple specialized robots and supervision
    from a support ship. Providing these dual capabilities in a single AUV will enable
    surveys without a ship, reduce costs and energy, and increase the rate and resolution
    of ocean studies.  The focus of this Phase I project is improving control of Asymmetric
    Propulsion for holding station relative to an object of interest. \n\nThis Small
    Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop and test control
    algorithms that preserve roll stability when Asymmetric Propulsion is used to
    turn and maneuver torpedo-shaped AUVs. Using a single motor with an asymmetric
    propeller to both move and steer an AUV is mechanically simpler but computationally
    more complex. Holding station relative to an object by actuating a single degree
    of freedom is a nontrivial under-constrained control and navigation problem. This
    problem has numerous applications in marine, terrestrial, and aerial robotics.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to assist with preparedness and decision-making for situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. This health crisis has been exacerbated by a lack of real-time information or predictive information about the extent, location, and spread of the disease. This Phase I project ingests data streams from government agencies, healthcare providers, and the general public, returning real-time, actionable information to assist in guiding a broad and coordinated response. While this platform is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is disease agnostic, and will have utility for seasonal influenza and other infectious diseases, positively impacting public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a platform aimed at providing real-time identification of infectious disease outbreaks and predictions of disease spread, with an initial focus on COVID-19. Among the gaps in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is capability to accurately track the magnitude, location, and spread of infectious agents. This project aims to assess and demonstrate the value of leveraging multiple modalities and sources of data for early detection and prediction of disease outbreaks, with focus on COVID-19. The approach will combine data fusion methods and epidemiological modeling approaches with continual input from subject matter experts in an effort to generate actionable information and predictive models related to disease spread. A variety of data streams providing information on disease incidence, transportation data, and sub-population interaction data will be used to construct progressively more sophisticated SEIR models. These efforts will result in an improved understanding of the utility and applicability of various data streams to epidemiological monitoring and forecasting, as well as platform for users of various levels of technical expertise.

    Phase I project will be to detect screen-to-camera video piracy, through first-in-kind
    development of a robust video piracy detection method that uniquely applies camera-display
    messaging to copyright protection, while maintaining network quality standards.
    \ Existing watermarking solutions cannot reliably handle video-in-video piracy,
    where users upload pirated media captured using a smartphone camera; either they
    fail to detect video piracy or exhibit injurious hypersensitivity. The proposed
    solution balances these two concerns by embedding unique and unextractable watermarks
    into video content, thereby improving the ability for platforms to accurately
    match uploaded content with messages in the copyright-protected database. The
    resulting technology will allow for the detection of copyright information in
    camera-captured images and video, so that distributors can automatically filter
    against the illegal sharing of copyright-protected material, dramatically reducing
    liability—and costly copyright infringement fines—for social media companies.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
    an innovative camera-display message system that uses photographic steganography
    to embed covert messages in displayed video, addressing the need to detect screen-to-camera
    video piracy.  Although photographic steganography has been applied to still images,
    video message embedding is complicated by the presence of perceptible artifacts
    that degrade visual quality.  This project proposes to use novel spatio-temporal
    embedding that adapts to video content to reduce visual artifacts and support
    message recovery. This method circumvents the artifact-based constraints of traditional
    grid systems and will support the standard viewing quality. The following Phase
    I objectives will establish technical and commercial feasibility: 1) develop a
    video compression model that can handle multiple compression variations; 2) develop
    an optimal adaptive spatio-temporal embedding approach that reduces observed visual
    artifacts while maintaining a high accuracy rate; 3) design and implement a paired
    comparison protocol perceptual metric to evaluate video quality after message
    embedding; 4) develop a real-time robust screen detection and segmentation algorithm.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the sustainable and economic retrofitting of low-performing older buildings toward improved economic, social and ecological impacts of built environments. More than half of all commercial buildings were constructed before the 1980s with lower energy standards.  The owners and occupants of these buildings now often seek better energy management and air quality technologies. The microalgae window developed in this Phase I project is an energy-efficient, easy-to-install, adaptable modular unit for different retrofitting applications, able to compete with conventional windows due to its good air quality and renewable energy potentials. Gains in worker productivity from microalgae window retrofit are estimated to be substantial and building values at sale or rental are expected to increase significantly due to building envelope improvement.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative, cost-effective microalgae window for retrofitting low-performing commercial windows. Microalgae are an effective biological system for carbon capture and biomass production from photosynthesis. The microalgae window incorporates a network of screens filled with microalgae within a window assembly to replace or add to older windows for energy-efficient retrofitting. The microalgae screen within a window assembly is able to balance multiple functions of thermal insulation, daylight transmission, solar shading efficacy, and views to outside. Research objectives are to: 1) characterize the optimal microalgae window system for pre-1980 office retrofitting applications; 2) verify environmental performance using computer simulations and lab experimentation in accordance with industry standards; and 3) conduct field testing to evaluate building energy savings, indoor air quality improvement and renewable energy production potentials.  The new microalgae window mitigates energy transfer between indoor and outdoor environments, subsequently reducing heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation demands.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the demonstration of an innovative, broadly applicable unique ID technology to link physical objects to the digital world. The proposed technology could help prevent counterfeits, as well as providing a manufacturer information on the product's movement in the supply and distribution chains. The key limitation preventing broad use of unique ID tags is that many key products and components are difficult or impossible to label with existing technologies due to either security, size, or cost. These constraints dramatically limit the space of applications. The tag prototype developed in this Phase I project will advance the field of wireless electronics by demonstrating the first remotely accessible microscopic electronic package.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of a new class of microscopic Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits (OWiCs). Specifically, this project will be focusing on developing a new OWiC specifically designed for use as a unique ID tag. The tag combines an all optical communication and power system with low-power integrated circuits in an effectively invisible package, too small to be resolved by the naked eye. This project will address the following technical challenges:  1) making a tiny wireless tag with complete functionality, 2) manufacturing at scale, and 3) using the tag.  Each of these hurdles will be addressed in this project with low-power integrated circuit design, parallel all-lithographic nanofabrication techniques, and new methods for placement of tags.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of energy-efficient windows. Electrochromic windows may be used to reduce energy costs related to climate control and lighting, eliminate glare, and improve visual comfort in commercial buildings. Electrochromic window manufacturers cite reduction in overall energy loads by an average of 20% and peak energy demand by up to 26%. Growth of the electrochromic window market has lagged because of high manufacturing costs. This project will enable low-cost manufacturing of films employed widely in energy conversion and conservation applications to enable widespread use of electrochromic energy-efficient windows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the translation of solution-processed transparent conductors used in large area devices. Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films are typically produced by vacuum-based techniques or chemical vapor deposition. These coatings often suffer from high expense, poor uniformity, and optical haze.  The proposed research is aimed to eliminate the common drawbacks of conventional TCO films. The technical objectives of this Phase I research project support development of low-cost, large area, solution deposited TCOs meeting industrial performance requirements.  This research project will establish correlations between precursor formulation and film processing to control film composition, morphology, and electrical properties and reliably meet industrial specifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-supported search engine that facilitates reproducibility and efficiency in life science research. Development of the proposed technology will allow researchers to quickly access unbiased recommendations on techniques and products to advance scientific discovery. By streamlining the literature search process and optimizing research at the experimental design stage, researchers are able to avoid lengthy trial-and-error in the laboratory and accelerate productive experiments. By providing researchers with literature-supported and relevant experimental recommendations within minutes, the proposed search engine can spare researchers time and resources spent on experimental methods poorly suited to their research goals, while also enabling researchers to explore promising methods potentially outside their standard operations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to address the persistent problems of experimental inefficiency and irreproducibility that slow life sciences research. Phase I efforts will advance the development and evaluation of a proof-of-concept search engine for recommendation of techniques associated with antibodies, a filter mechanism capable of refining search results, and automatically generated graphical analytics presenting key data on technique usage. Leveraging machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan the entire body of peer-reviewed literature and extract data relevant to technique-based search terms, search outputs will accordingly rank antibodies and protocol conditions. To filter results, constraints, such as access to equipment or target genes, will be imposed through development of NLP algorithms capable of identifying relevant contextual information indicating conformance to imposed criteria. Accuracy and relevance of the developed platform's search results will be compared to a popular research-based search engine and is expected to demonstrate highly refined search outputs and recommendations, supporting improved experimental design.

The technology developed in this Phase I proposal will build an intelligent, low-cost, high-performance, silicon carbide power switch.  The proposed technology can potentially increase energy efficiency by up to 10% and reduce power electronic energy dissipation by 5X for a wide range of applications, including industrial power supplies, motor drives, solar inverters, battery chargers, adapters for consumer electronics and in electric vehicles. In addition, the proposed technology is also an enabler for efficient power delivery in future applications such as electric aircraft, space flight and quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a novel four-terminal silicon carbide field-effect transistor that, when combined with a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor in a novel topology, will create an innovative wide-bandgap switch. The proposed device innovations will allow 50% die-size reduction compared to existing silicon carbide solutions, with similar or better switching losses, and with the potential to achieve cost parity with silicon technology in high-volume production. Moreover, the proposed switch has excellent gate reliability without the need for tight controls on the gate or drain overshoot. By combining the power of advanced silicon technology with silicon carbide the proposed research presents an opportunity to enable a truly intelligent power-switching platform with high power density and high efficiency.

    the novel read operation. The project goals are to validate the novel MRAM read
    circuit with silicon test data and perform a model study to quantify system level
    benefits.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a point-of-care biomedical device for the rapid and quantitative measurement of airway inflammation.  Currently, methods to measure airway inflammation and disease control are difficult.  Recent innovation in breath analysis has provided opportunity to better understand airway disease.  However, the reach of these innovations has been limited due to cost and availability. Chronic lower respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of death worldwide across all countries and income levels. There is an urgent need for methods to better monitor and manage these chronic lower respiratory diseases to improve survival and patients’ quality of life. Using an advanced chemical system, the proposed technology will measure a biomarker of inflammation in exhaled breath condensate (EBC).  Success of this project will deeply impact fundamental pulmonary research and create broad societal value by improving health and reducing burdens on the healthcare system. This will be particularly valuable to underserved urban communities where poor air quality leads to increased severity of respiratory diseases. This product also has significant commercial potential, with the ability to reduce costs and streamline treatment in an industry valued over $100 B annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and implement an advanced proprietary automated chemiluminescent reagent mixing and detector system for instantaneous measurement of airway inflammation by real-time breath analysis. Hydrogen peroxide reports on airway inflammation, which is a critical factor in respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but is difficult to accurately measure at the point-of-care. The current methods of choice include highly invasive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), time-consuming and costly laboratory hydrogen peroxide assays, or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which provides an incomplete picture of airway inflammation. This project will fill this analysis gap and provide a valuable solution to monitoring airway inflammation in patients at the point-of-care. The proposed aims for developing a system to measure exhaled hydrogen peroxide in Phase I will include: a cartridge-based reagent delivery and mixing designed to optimize limit of detection and reproducibility; a robust and compact reader equipped with optimized photon detection technology and built-in vortex mixer; and careful analysis of sensitivity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide versus potentially interfering analytes.

    Phase I project will be to facilitate the use of wind energy.  While wind turbines
    are a carbon-free energy source, they may impact the habitats of birds and bats;
    recently, bats have emerged as a critical focus for the wind industry since there
    are several threatened and endangered North American bat species whose territories
    overlap with existing and planned wind development sites. The current method of
    determining an onshore wind turbine’s impact on wildlife requires biologists to
    walk transects in cleared plots around the turbines looking for carcasses.  This
    method is not only expensive, it also leads to uncertain impact estimates.  For
    offshore wind turbines there is currently no method for determining impacts, which
    may hinder the ability to permit projects. This project will provide a tool for
    automatically assessing bat mortality around industrial wind turbines. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use structured light imaging
    and advanced computer vision to detect bat mortality around utility-scale wind
    turbines.  The concept is to mount near-infrared (NIR) cameras and illuminators
    to the turbine and continuously record images at night during bat activity.  Image

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a high-throughput, low-cost solution to alleviate a major bottleneck in genomics and cancer research. Special next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflows have become one of the most important tools for personalized medicine, helping scientists discover new ways to diagnose cancer and other diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes.  While sequencing platforms continue to advance technologically, less attention has been given to improving the necessary and difficult step of fragmenting or shearing genomic DNA (gDNA) to prepare samples for NGS.  An estimated 75-80% of work activity in a modern-day analytical lab is spent on processing and preparing samples. The current industry standard for  gDNA shearing requires expensive instrumentation (>$150,000), and can require more than 2 hours to serially process 96-samples. Less expensive alternative solutions perform inconsistently, and are not amenable for high-throughput applications.  A critical need exists for a high-throughput, low-cost solution for parts of this process. The proposed project is focused on developing a targeted lens technology for a high-throughput, low-cost sonication device. The ultimate goal of this project is to make sample processing for NGS applications inexpensive, consistent, fast, and widely available.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a transformative solution to inconsistent, costly, and cumbersome sample processing for NGS.   The Targeted Multifocal Lens (TML) technology will enable consistent, parallel gDNA shearing of 96 samples in a standard PCR microplate, improving by an order of magnitude both throughput speed and reduced capital costs.  The TML technology employs kinoform theory to enable focused sonication of multiple samples using just a single acoustic source, thus eliminating the need for robotic scanning systems. In Phase I, we will design and prototype a novel bath-type sonicator that integrates with the TML technology. We will perform theoretical and experimental modeling and characterization to demonstrate feasibility of TML for consistent sonication of a 96-well microplate. We will finally validate the performance of the prototype sonicator by shearing 96 samples of gDNA in parallel, in under 15 minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to use novel energy harvesting techniques to benefit the expanding wearables market and improve the lives of patients who use prosthetics and orthotics. New integrated circuit technology enables vibration energy harvesting from a physically much smaller vibration harvester. These smaller harvesters enable multiple applications. For example, battery life in wearables to track heart rate and steps walked could be extended. Also, fabric-based vibration energy harvesting applications could be realized in military and first responder uniforms to power communication devices. Similarly, for commercial markets clothing-integrated sensors for digital health applications could be powered by vibration harvesting. Finally, first markets will be explored for vibration harvesting systems integrated in prosthetics or orthotics to improve the quality of life for patients.  A sensor system in orthotics could detect medical complications in patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy.   These new energy harvesting circuits could potentially also power sensors integrated into prosthetics that could identify structural and mechanical problems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a vibration energy interface circuit that allows cold start-up from record low voltages and low currents using novel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) design techniques. These CMOS design techniques use only one vibration harvester input to charge large loads such as 100µF capacitors without the use of a transformer or Schottky diodes.  Lowering the minimum start-up voltage in a vibration harvesting interface circuit has been a significant area of circuit research in integrated circuit design over the last decade. The innovation proposed for this SBIR Phase I project uses a classic Cockcroft-Walton charge pump with large off-chip 100µF capacitors. The charge pump's rectification is designed in CMOS to allow leakage-based signals to form and switch the charge pump's rectification from cold start-up. In this project there will be continued research into integrated circuit techniques and solutions to lower the minimum start-up voltage in a circuit interface to a vibration harvester.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to commercialize an automatable microfluidic technology capable of disrupting the existing sample preparation market. This market, projected to surpass $5.32 billion USD by 2025, is driven by the development of new and automatable technology platforms. These technology platforms not only facilitate the development of precision medicine, but also our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind cellular behavior. Here, automated sample preparation platforms are favored for their ease of use and integration potential with both upstream cell capture technologies (e.g. single cell selection, rare cell enrichment) as well as downstream analysis technologies (e.g. DNA/RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry). Rather than requiring scientists to reproduce complex in-house protocols developed by different academic laboratories, automated platforms would allow users the freedom of simply loading a sample and walking away. However, existing platforms in this market are limited by their fundamental single-compartment design, making the processing of complex systems highly challenging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a fundamentally different approach to multi-omic single cell processing. Instead of relying on a single-compartment design (e.g. droplet microfluidics, microwell technologies, valved and chambered microchannels, tube-based kits, etc.) for cell processing, this project will use novel micropillar-based microfluidic technology for high efficiency separation and isolation of single cell omes. Here, micropillar arrays within our microfluidic channels serve to physically size-separate genomic DNA from proteins and RNA during cell lysis in a manner compatible with existing analysis methods. In Phase I, we will build upon our preliminary results by demonstrating bi-omic isolation of the genome and transcriptome from the same cell along with the ability to amplify and sequence the genomic DNA before and after bisulfite treatment for tri-omic isolation of the genome, transcriptome, and methylome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is twofold. (1) Capturing business opportunities in the athleisure market by providing functional textiles with radiative cooling capabilities. As climate change has led to more hot summer days, clothing with advanced cooling features will have significant public safety values. The global cooling fabrics market is projected to grow at a 10% annual rate from $1.8 Billion to $2.9 Billion by 2021. Cooling fabrics conventionally rely upon sweat wicking, and no major brand has incorporated radiative cooling technologies in textiles. MetaRE fabrics will address this unmet need by delivering a novel cooling technology substantially more efficient than sweat wicking. (2) Alleviating the environmental impact of the textile industry. Each year, 63 million tons of synthetic fibers are produced. These fibers turn into 300 billion square meters of textiles, which go through the clothing value chain, and ultimately turn into textile waste. This vast and growing stream of textile waste is creating a massive environmental burden. By introducing nanoscale air voids into fibers, MetaRE fabrics will reduce the consumption of petrochemicals by 30% and will use 50% less dye to reach desired color brightness and saturation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish design and manufacturing technologies for creating radiative cooling fibers and fabrics. The prototype polymer fabrics will have three unique features: superior opacity, radiative cooling, and brilliant metallic luster, all resulting from nanoscale air filaments embedded in the fibers. The radiative cooling feature, in particular, is due to a combination of strong and broadband reflectivity of the fiber in the solar spectrum and high emissivity of the fiber in the thermal radiation spectrum. Research objectives of this SBIR Phase I project include: Develop melt and wet extrusion recipes to produce nanostructured polymer fibers with proper morphology, optical and thermodynamic properties, and mechanical strength; Demonstrate optical, thermodynamic, and mechanical performance of radiative cooling fabrics. To overcome obstacles to industrial adoption, the fiber production processes will require relatively minor changes to existing fiber extrusion equipment, and fibers produced will need to meet mechanical and throughput requirements comparable to those for conventional fibers. A set of optical and thermodynamic techniques and tools will be developed to characterize the spectral properties of the fibers and fabrics from the ultraviolet to the long-wavelength mid-infrared and to quantify the radiative cooling capabilities of the finished fabrics.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a quick, easy,
    and accurate way to count cattle and detect bovine illnesses on feedlots and ranches
    via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Current methods for counting cattle are
    extremely time-consuming or inaccurate, and sometimes both.  Additionally, bovine
    illnesses are often diagnosed too late, leading to 50% of cattle mortalities on
    feedlots and yielding a $1.9 billion economic loss to the cattle industry.  The
    proposed technology will leverage aerial images to (a) count cattle accurately
    and efficiently and (b) identify ill cows up to one week before clinical symptoms
    appear without the need to install expensive health-monitoring equipment on each
    cow.  Ultimately, the proposed technology promises to more broadly impact the
    way wildlife and endangered species are tracked by automating wildlife counting
    on aerial images.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
    project proposes to develop an imaging-based solution for feedlot accountants,
    nutritionists, and auditors to monitor cattle.  The project will leverage aerial
    photos of feedlot pens to automatically count all cattle breeds - regardless of
    season and ground conditions - using a combination of deep learning and traditional
    image processing tools.  Additionally, this project will leverage aerial thermography
    to measure bovine temperatures; machine learning tools will be developed to differentiate
    between elevated body temperatures associated with illness and those associated
    with normal confounding factors.  The goals of this Phase I project are to develop
    and fully validate the technology for cattle counting on feedlots and to establish
    the technical feasibility of leveraging aerial thermographic imaging for prediction
    of cattle health.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the acceleration of discoveries in microbiome science by wider adoption of whole metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing. These DNA and RNA sequencing techniques are the gold standard for data generation in microbiome-based drugs and diagnostics, but are prohibitively expensive for large-scale research efforts. The high cost is due to two factors: First, customers are required to sequence large quantities of DNA and RNA to adequately analyze the microbiome; and second, research projects are plagued by long turnaround times due to lower sample throughput. The proposed product will enrich microbial cells and will remove contaminants before the sequencing analysis begins. If successful, the commercial impact of this product for end-users will be substantial cost savings and the ability to expand their customer base, enabling scientific progress to accelerate in microbiome research. Accomplishing the technical aims set forth in this Phase I proposal will significantly reduce technical risk in the company's commercialization efforts by demonstrating proof-of-feasibility for a single-use device and bench-top instrument capable of enriching microbes prior to metagenomic sequencing.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a microbial enrichment tool to significantly reduce the cost and difficulty of analyzing microbiomes using DNA and RNA sequencing.  At present, sequencing laboratory directors only are able to analyze microbiomes at tremendous expense because samples are highly contaminated with DNA and RNA derived from host cells. The proposed solution is a disposable cartridge and a control instrument that will enable lab personnel to rapidly enrich microbes directly from samples without the use of bioengineered tags or labels that introduce bias, and enable the generation of sequencing libraries composed primarily of bacterial DNA and RNA. The technical challenges in this proposal are to convert the current laboratory method for enriching bacteria demonstrated previously into a bench-top instrument that uses a simple and disposable device compatible with current sequencing workflows that requires minimal operator steps. The system's performance in Phase I will be evaluated using spike-in samples with bacterial isolates and mock communities to simulate realistic microbiomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to overcome the barrier to transparent passive radiative cooling materials that are applicable to commercial environments.  The project develops a transparent passive cooling thin-film applicable to situations that lose efficiency when heated, and where both mechanical and thermal stress are involved, for example, over advertisements on refrigerated trucks, or on the front face of solar panels. It will provide the simultaneous qualities of transparency in visible wavelengths, durability to withstand the elements, flexibility for ease of application, high cooling power to address customers' pain points, and manufacturability in a roll to roll format to minimize costs. The technology has the potential to provide a 25-80% increase in fuel efficiency via application of the thin-film to the outside of refrigerated truck trailers. The benefits to customers include: fuel cost savings, reduced emissions, allowing regulatory requirements to be met, decreased maintenance and replacement costs compared to refrigeration units and in-truck insulation in truck, as well as temperature maintenance in maximum heat.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a thin-film product that could revolutionize cooling technologies across a number of industries. The demand for temperature-sensitive goods is expected to continue to grow significantly. To address the need for refrigeration with reduced fuel costs and emissions, the project is developing selective photonic emitters in thermal wavelength windows such that instead of heat being effectively enclosed in an insulating thermos (the atmosphere), they are exposed to a vast cold sink of space. The result is a revolutionary method of entirely passive heat management. This approach will be optimized in a thin-film photonics material that provides significant cooling to refrigerated truck trailers, saving refrigeration fuel costs. Phase I research objectives will establish proof of feasibility and include producing and testing promising material combinations at wafer-scale, testing to ensure that the material's qualities transfer to a commercially relevant size, and performing a small-scale test with potential customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve data harnessing and real-time intelligent decision making. The proposed technology is a new reconfigurable computing platform capable of performing a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks in a distributed and parallel manner to deliver the best performance at a lower cost. The end products are AI accelerator chips that can be integrated in Accelerator Cards or as co-processors to be applied in both server and edge computing solutions to accelerate AI tasks. The general market need is particularly acute for data center and cloud computing industries where major pain points are performance bottlenecks and high costs due to custom chips or reliance on graphic processing units. The core value propositions of the proposed technology are faster compute, programmability at run-time, and easier integration with existing software to enable execution of popular machine learning frameworks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase I project centers around a novel computing approach where computing and memory elements are parallel and distributed, and interconnection between computing elements is flexible. The project develops an integrated circuit chip that can be reconfigured at run-time to behave as a custom application-specific integrated circuit for each running Artificial Intelligence (AI) application to deliver the optimal performance. It will overcome the memory bottleneck that traditional computing technologies face where data needs to be continuously loaded to and from memory.  The proposed technology also addresses the adaptivity challenge for evolving AI models and datasets. The proposed activities include a chip fabrication using a 28nm commercial semiconductor foundry process, extensive benchmarking of the new technology for scalability, adaptability to data size and shape, and research on a software interface to execute codes developed by existing machine learning frameworks in the new chip. The prototype chip is expected to demonstrate distributed and parallel computing capabilities along with dynamic reconfigurability.  The benchmarking work is anticipated to reveal at least an order of magnitude improvement over more conventional graphics processing unit based approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved care for plantar fasciitis (PF), an inflammation of the fibrous tissue (plantar fascia) along the bottom of the foot connecting the heel bone to the toes.  This progressive degenerative condition results in stabbing, sometimes debilitating, pain.  Plantar fasciitis is most common in athletes, but it also occurs in sedentary people, particularly overweight individuals, and is the most common cause of heel pain in adults, with an estimated lifetime risk of 10%. In the US, approximately 2-3 million patients are treated for PF every year and it is the leading reason to visit a podiatrist. Conservative treatments of PF are moderately successful, but 20% to 30% of patients progress to a chronic condition that can last years and is difficult to treat.  The proposed dynamic night splint is intended to accelerate healing relative to conventional splinting technologies and to improve patient compliance and prognosis.  This can potentially be used for other medical conditions where controlled motion is better than a static constraint.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates miniature electromechanical components, “internet-of-things” technology, and a patient-centric approach to medical device design to achieve a re-imagined night splint.  The concept enables a shift from rigid constraint of the injured tissue to actively manipulating the tissue to accelerate recovery.  To achieve a clinically viable solution this will address competing requirements, including incorporation of dynamic components, a control and power system, an intuitive user interface, and reliable safety features, while minimizing the form factor and maximizing patient comfort.  This Phase 1 project designs and fabricates the night splint with the necessary elements (a leg engaging flexible “boot” structure, an electromechanical drive system, and a mobile app user interface) to validate the design through bench testing and user assessments.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a new vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic. To date millions have been infected, with hundreds of thousands of deaths.  Leading vaccine candidates in clinical trials require two doses, resulting in either: 1) increased spread due to lack of isolation, or 2) incomplete vaccination due to non-compliance. Successful development of a single-dose, self-applied vaccine would not only have a significant positive impact on global COVID-19 immunization efforts, but may also trasnsform the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution. This project advances the understanding of using a novel at-home device as a vaccination tool for many diseases, broadly aiding public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to combine a silk-based microneedle patch with an mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) construct to meet the global need for a robust COVID-19 vaccine. Combining the unique properties of silk fibroin, a low-cost biomaterial, with a single-dose, self-applied microneedle patch represents a novel approach to vaccination and will result in improved protection by allowing the target antigen to slowly release over two weeks. Additionally, the use of mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 peptides that produce neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein and mitigate potential issues from antibody-dependent enhancement will ultimately result in a safer and more effective vaccine. The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate lead formulations of a silk-mRNA-LNP complex that will be thermally stable and identify a release profile of target antigen to improve SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity. Results from preliminary in vitro formulation screens and in vivo dosing and scheduling will be used to develop the formulations for the silk microneedle patch in Phase II studies. This project will identify lead candidate silk-mRNA-LNP shelf-stable formulations with improved immunogenicity that is at least equivalent to traditional, non-formulated injections, while offering critical insight into broader implications of mRNA-based vaccinations and sustained release.

External testing is expensive and can take from a day to weeks for results. For current in-office tests, 40% of all yeast infections and 30% of bacterial infections are misdiagnosed and require further visits.  More importantly, vaginitis can lead to a large fraction of spontaneous preterm births - a major cause of neonatal mortality, emotional distress and lifelong disability worldwide. In the US, PTB results in healthcare costs of $26 B/year, motivating a fast and accurate test.  This project will develop an advanced test that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to study samples quickly and accurately in the doctor's office.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project advances a novel test for vaginitis upon clinical presentation.  This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) image analysis with a high-quality fluorescence microscope to rapidly scan specimens in the doctor's office for fast diagnosis. This project will validate preliminary studies suggesting higher image accuracy compared to viewing similar samples under a microscope. Phase 1 of this project will examine prepared samples from diverse patient populations of up to 500 women to optimize analysis and characterization of VHA automated digital pathology system. All samples will be compared to manual assessment currently used clinically. Additionally, user testing in multiple types of clinical research environments, such as medical schools and health networks, will be undertaken to diversify patient sample populations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to protect healthcare workers and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) through automated medication delivery. The healthcare system is facing an unprecedented emergency during the COVID-19 crisis.  The US has just 3.3 hospital beds available per 1,000 people, and healthcare workers have accounted for 10% of COVID-19 cases in Italy. This project will decrease the frequency of direct contact with patients through a medication dispenser integrated with the Electronic Health Record (EHR). In the near term, it will lower the chance of transmission of the novel coronavirus, saving limited PPE supplies, and potentially alleviating mounting pressure on the healthcare system.  In the longer term, it can be used for other medical conditions; for instance, it can enable a patient to self-administer pain medication in a device that provides reporting for EHR and the physician, potentially addressing the national opioid epidemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the design and development of a medical device managed by secure software and integrated with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) via FHIR (Fast Hospital Interoperability Resources), an emerging protocol and evolution of HL7 (Health Level 7) intended to radically simplify the data interface in the EHR system. The outcome of the project is to further the interface between the device and the hospital EHR through FHIR. The SBIR Phase 1 project is focused on defining challenges for this EHR-FHIR integration, including potential cybersecurity risks.

    Phase I project would come from the successful development of a nano-porous membrane-based
    filtration technology enabling lower-energy, low-cost, and rapid molecular separations
    in gas and liquid phases.  The proposed technology is to develop new materials
    for membranes used to separate liquid or gas samples into their components.  Although
    the primary focus of the current project is a new type of refrigeration system,
    the core technology has a wide range of potential applications including desalination
    of agricultural and potable water sources, blood dialysis, industrial liquid-liquid
    separations, CO2 removal from air, and separation of oxygen from air. \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I projct is to advance a 2-dimensional (2D)
    molecular sieve, based on a Covalent Organic Framework (COF), to enable a new
    type of refrigeration system using water and endothermic salts. The closed-cycle
    refrigeration system requires a nano-porous membrane to regenerate the used coolant
    into two streams (water and brine) so that a subsequent recombination will again
    provide a cooling effect. High flux and high rejection of hydrated NH4 cations
    at low pressures are critical to successful operation.   The project will explore
    the condensation of diamines with dicarbonitriles in COF formation, study how
    hydrogen substitution in NH groups can optimize rejection of NH4(H2O)4 ions, and
    investigate how charge works as a rejection mechanism in 2D COFs.  Benchmarks

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the further development of sustainable mobility by developing a new, disruptive class of renewable materials for low-rolling resistance tire tread rubber compound applications. The company will be active not only in materials development and sales, but also in the exploration of new and valuable application areas for energy-efficient renewable materials. The initial target application area is the material used in low-rolling resistance tread compounds for tires currently using petroleum-derived materials, a $5 B market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be directed to the technical feasibility of a critical enabling technology supporting the use of renewable elastomers in low-rolling resistance tire applications. Specifically, the innovation will focus on latex-phase nano-scale reinforcement of natural rubber using novel functional silica-based materials. The technical hurdles include translation of the technology from spin-coating of polytetrafluoroethylene nanoemulsion thin films to bulk solids formation from a natural rubber latex. These are significant challenges because the formation mechanisms, required functional groups, and end-use performance requirements are significantly different. Specific challenges include creation of novel functional silica-based materials; uniform dispersion of the materials in a natural rubber (NR) latex; interactions between the material and the phospholipid of the NR latex particle surface; the chemistry and concentration of the functionalization; characterization of the resulting composite polymer and its microstructure; and adaptation and processing of the innovative polymer into a vulcanized rubber tire tread compound with the desired properties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to greatly advance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) in terms of efficiency, stability, and readiness for commercialization. The success of the proposed research and development (R&D) activities will ensure a smooth transition from the realization of concepts in Phase I to prototype development of PVSCs on flexible substrates through slot-die coating in SBIR Phase II. Our final products will be mass-produced through low-cost roll-to-roll (R2R) printing and satisfy the customer needs for additional and cheaper electricity. By integrating our high-performance fully flexible solar panels with freight trailers/reefers, freight-truck owners can significantly reduce the diesel fuel consumption (by 30%) and avoid idle run of diesel engine while the drivers are resting. When our products are attached to the military tents, sufficient electricity can be generated to meet electricity needs at forward operating bases (FOBs), thereby significantly relieving the demand for diesel fuel at remote locations and effectively limiting the casualties related to the fuel transportation. In addition to its technical and commercial contribution, this project will impact society by involving and educating the new generation on the PVSCs with a sub-award to The University of Alabama.

    The proposed project will clear the obstacles that currently preventing PVSCs from upscaling manufacture and commercialization. Metal oxides rather than organic materials as charge transport layers have been demonstrated to enhance both device performance and stability. However, high quality metal-oxide films require high thermal annealing temperatures and long annealing time, which will destroy both flexible substrates and perovskite absorber layer.  Photonic irradiation will be employed to achieve rapid and layer-specific annealing for both metal-oxide hole transport layer (HTL) and metal-oxide electron transport layer (ETL) without damaging other layers in PVSCs. Moreover, the rapid layer-specific photonic annealing happens in seconds, which is fully compatible with the R2R printing. With compositional engineering, the perovskite absorber layer will also go through rapid photonic treatment. The resulted PVSCs will be able to achieve PCE over 25% with long-term stability and pave the way for large-scale manufacturing of PVSCs through high-speed printing. The proposed highly-selective photonic treatment for each stacking layer in HTL/Perovskite/ETL sandwich structure provides the solution to achieve stabilized PVSCs with efficiency over 25%.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will revolutionize AC-DC convertors that are present in nearly all existing and future residential and commercial electronic devices.  Reduced convertor complexity and increased power efficiency will result in extreme cost savings for both the manufacturers of these devices as well as the end consumers, enabling adoption to all corners of society.  This dramatically different integrated convertor will also bring powerline communications into these electronic devices, a game changer that will enable electronics developers to add intelligence to their products across numerous markets such as home and office IoT devices, AC powered medium-wattage (~5W) electronics, power-over-ethernet, and smart LED lighting.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create an alternative integrated AC-DC converter architecture.  Existing converters have numerous bulky, expensive, and unreliable discrete magnetic components that will be replaced with this integrated circuit (IC) based solution.  The result of this project will be a reduced footprint, reduced BOM count, efficient converter for medium wattage (~5W) electronic loads.  This project will additionally support low wattage loads (<1W) with an even smaller footprint and even lower BOM count, showcasing the scalability of this technology which is not an option with existing fly-back AC-DC convertor solutions.  Validation of the Phase I IC-based converter performance will provide a foundation for Phase II, and incorporation into powerline communications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce a novel form of ultralight wearable cooling technology.  Excess weight is a key limitation of active wearable cooling technology today, restricting its adoption.  In contrast, active indoor heating and cooling, where solutions are stationary and the weight is relatively unimportant, is a multi-billion dollar market.  Significant unmet demand exists for lightweight active cooling that can work outdoors as well.  The proposed wearable cooling technology would improve performance and comfort while reducing the risk of dehydration and heat stroke.  Users who can benefit range from specialty applications to recreational uses.  For example, military personnel who are active in hot climates while wearing body armor and struggling to stay hydrated is one specialty application.  Other specialty applications include welders wearing protective gear in hot environments.  Here, extending work times, improving comfort and thus reducing errors would boost productivity.  Endurance athletes could also benefit from faster times during events of multiple hours in hot climates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for a state-of-the-art Droplet Transmission Technology (DTT) for Ultralight Wearable Cooling System (UWCS) to achieve a flexible, ultralight cooling technology that allows longer-lasting, powerful cooling capabilities for the end-user. The proposed activity will demonstrate DTT, a novel transport phenomenon.  DTT enables a unique way to manage and generate cooling from two-phase flows. The design of channels utilized in the product and their dimensions will be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and tested via 3D printing of the experimental prototypes. The final UWCS design for the full torso prototype will be integrated and the cooling capabilities verified using a thermal manikin.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide global populations with a safe, affordable and viable edible vaccine against the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). hRSV is a critical global health problem, annually affecting 64 million people and causing over 160,000 death, motivating a vaccine. Natural food-derived vaccines offer advantages over traditional injections by providing a safe, affordable, non-invasive, non-egg-based (reduced allergenic risk), vegan-friendly, effective and efficient antigen-delivery system. The project addresses this need by developing a cherry-tomato-based oral vaccine that can be administered painlessly in a chewable gummy-like pill formulation or in oral drops.  The proposed fruit-vaccines will minimize the global incidence of hRSV through scalable production and distribution, increasing global accessibility and vaccination rates. Furthermore, with fewer disposables it is more environmentally friendly. This method could apply broadly to other oral-delivery platforms.

    This Phase I project will advance peptide-based oral-delivery platforms.  The project will improve the yield and consistent expression of the immunogenic antigen (hRSV-F protein) in the plant, both pre- and post-harvest, as well as before and after delivery into the body. The approach involves bioengineering the plant-optimized gene for the hRSV-F protein to improve its stability by blocking undesirable cleavage sites while retaining the desirable protective epitopes of the hRSV-F immunogen. Transgenic plants expressing the stabilized hRSV-F in the tomato fruits will be grown in a greenhouse. The hRSV-F-containing cherry-tomatoes will be harvested, homogenized (pureed), and then lyophilized (freeze-dried) to formulate innovative vaccine purees or pills, respectively. Tasks include conducting qualitative and quantitative analyses, such as color, consistency, pH, concentration of intact hRSV-F protein, its potential degradation products and desired epitope/s, analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western-blot and high-performance liquid chromatography.  These tests will help characterize the persistence and effectiveness of the proposed changes on hRSV-F protein expression, yield, and stability in fresh-fruits, tomato-puree and in the freeze-dried fruit-pills. Similar assessments will be performed also post-ingestion, in the gut contents and in blood of mice.

    synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection
    free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds.
    While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound
    healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US
    $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans
    suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe
    morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000
    deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant
    pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is
    very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple
    pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop
    further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing
    a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious
    pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product
    is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and
    is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use
    of any additional agents.  \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the
    feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial
    cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant
    bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current
    product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment
    along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon
    contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels,
    the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and
    stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores
    two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent
    crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to
    dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines
    by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by
    reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally

    and monitoring performance via the proposed in-home therapy platform may demonstrate
    a reduction in symptoms or slowing of disease progression, thereby helping to
    reduce costly, adverse medical complications and improving the PwP quality of
    life. Data collected from regular in-home, daily therapies may lead to improved
    standards of care and aid the research community in the search for a cure. Once

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an urgent need for a rapid and convenient
    method to monitor blood phenylalanine levels for patients with phenylketonuria,

    therefore have elevated, toxic levels. These patients are treated with a severely
    protein-restricted diet and other potential medications. Since excess phenylalanine
    results in neurologic injury, and inadequate phenylalanine results in protein
    malnutrition, the diet of patients must be carefully balanced. This balance can
    only be accomplished by tracking blood phenylalanine levels, which fluctuate throughout
    the day. Currently the turnaround time of laboratory tests is 5 to 7 days, and
    sometimes longer, during which patients may experience prolonged episodes of behavioral

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly improve the way clinicians and researchers measure, study and treat pain.  Chronic pain affects 20% of U.S. adults and costs $600 billion annually. Opioids are often the first treatment option offered to patients with chronic pain. Currently pain is assessed using simplistic, subjective and generalized visual/verbal scales (1-10) with little ability to localize the origin. It is essential for clinicians and medical researchers to have calibrated and accurate measures of pain to assist patients in determining the underlying disease and directing patients to the most effective therapies. This project will develop a new biomedical tool to quantify pain data for multimodal treatment plans to potentially minimize opioid use. This tool will improve quality of life for people suffering from chronic pain and help those on opioids find better therapies. Furthermore, it will help clinicians with varied levels of training and experience achieve the highest level of exam skill.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will digitize a physical exam by capturing palpation location and pressure and patient pain expression via multiple biosensors to create a personalized “contour” map of pain intensity onto a 3D image of the human body. This comprehensive and calibrated data set can then be used to assist clinicians in developing a more accurate differential diagnosis for the underlying pain condition. This project will advance the hardware and software components for future integration with augmented reality and artificial intelligence modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a data analytic tool to predict and identify the organ of origin from early cancer screening blood tests. This will allow noninvasive detection of cancer at early stages, when it can be treated with potentially improved outcomes and in a less costly manner.  Second, a complementary application of the proposed  technology is to address an unmet need in identifying cancer organ of origin in metastatic cancers of unknown primary, where not knowing the organ of origin hampers designing an effective treatment plan in 30,000+ cases/yr in the U.S.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accomplish internal development, and external validation of the proposed data analytic technology so it is ready to be validated on circulating tumor DNA data from blood, and can be used for metastatic tumors of unknown primary origin.  The proposed technology addresses the problem of the unknown primary by analyzing whole genome or large subsets using predictive tools. Different cancer (sub)types have different patterns or signatures of somatic single nucleotide variations in the cancer genome. A library of these signatures is built using a large number of whole genome data samples with a broad cross-section of known cancer (sub)types. The unknown cancer organ of origin of a new data sample is identified by comparing its somatic mutational patterns to the signatures in the library. A key research objective is to identify the minimum subset of whole genome required to determine the cancer organ of origin to facilitate its application in blood tests.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is ultimately to increase the representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) employment areas, enabling the US to meet the increasing demand for STEM workers and maintain competitiveness in the global innovation community. Factors promoting underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM often take effect early in education and extend beyond traditional classrooms settings; this solution specifically addresses the support needed by parents in order to facilitate STEM informal learning in a way that is particularly engaging for their young daughters. This proposed project, based on evidence-based research in learning in informal environments, will deliver monthly personalized informal learning plans to enable parents to catalyze positive STEM experiences for girls early in their learning journeys so that they are more likely to embrace STEM careers and better positioned to secure them in the future.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform the way young girls perceive and engage in STEM career exploration by providing a progressive playlist of STEM informal learning experiences personalized to their unique interests. This is accomplished through a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven recommender system that learns from user preferences and attributes to recommend content and learning experiences, which are meant to increase STEM confidence and interest for young girls as well as inspire their curiosity. Parents can opt to provide immediate feedback on the recommended plan that further tunes the plan to their child’s needs or swap selections with secondary recommendations. The proposed project’s objectives are to develop and test algorithmic model for sequenced recommendations, design and build the prototype application, and conduct research to determine that personalized recommendation sequences deepen and/or expand STEM knowledge and interests. To guide the development, efficacy of the recommender will be assessed by comparing results from conducting studies using human recommendations with results using the AI recommender. Once the algorithmic model is established, pre and post assessments will be conducted to assess impact of the intervention on engagement and curiosity with STEM, thereby contributing to an increase in knowledge in the field as well as a commercially applicable and timely marketplace product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a transformational ventilator design targeted at the unmet clinical need for low-cost (<$3000), highly functional, rugged, modular and low maintenance ventilators supporting advanced ventilation modes. Current midrange ventilators cost between $8,000-20,000 with high-end ventilation units costing up to $50,000. The proposed design uses highly efficient and low-cost modern technologies with few moving functional elements. Only four modules are employed, designed to connect together in a quick-release, tool-less fashion requiring no service technicians to maintain. The design ensures that the new ventilator will work in existing hospital and acute care settings by (a) supporting networking of mobile devices for remote monitoring, (b) networking to hospital information systems to integrate with patient records and analytic systems, (c) supporting standard breathing patient circuit tubing and intubation tubes, (d) inclusion of monitoring settings and alarms, (e) supporting the use of hospital oxygen, oxygen in cylinders, medical air and atmospheric air. The global mechanical ventilator market was valued at $2.94 billion in 2019 and is estimated to reach $12.54 billion by 2027, driven by the rising worldwide prevalence of respiratory diseases including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. This new design will favorably impact clinical settings including acute care facilities, in-transit systems, home health care and developing countries.  It is ideal for surge and scale requirements, such as stockpiling by hospitals, strategic national stockpiles, mass casualty response and humanitarian missions.

    This SBIR Phase I project leverages applied engineering principles and understanding the mechanics of compressible fluids.  It leverages the use of computer-aided design and engineering, 3D printing, networking and low-cost components in consideration of hospital protocols. Novel innovations include: (a) positive displacement, volumetric air motive system for air/O2 delivery, and (b) a multi-position single element rotary selector valve for flow control of the air motive system. An inexpensive bill of materials is achieved with minimal components for low weight (<4 pounds not including battery backup), small logistics footprint, minimal component failure points, ease of maintenance and rapid scale of manufacture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide new tools to evaluate and enhance teaching of higher-order critical thinking.  This project will leverage advanced machine learning models to generate critical-thinking questions for any text a student reads, analyze their written response, give them immediate feedback on how to refine their thinking, and ultimately provide data-driven insights to their teachers. The capability to automatically interpret open-ended responses using artificial intelligence (AI) is a rich area for the educational community.  This project will deepen the education community's knowledge in this area and apply the findings to K-12 education. In particular, the results may lead to a new evaluation architecture relying less on multiple-choice questions and related techniques, enhancing education with a method to efficiently evaluate and provide feedback with open-ended and short-response questions. This project will address the problem of using multiple-choice assessments to assess ‘learning’ and move to more accurate ways to ascertain the nuances of learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on automated short-answer scoring to solve a pressing and largely unsolved problem. Most work in automated scoring focuses on longer essay grading, which is more relevant for higher education. At this time, there are no general-purpose algorithms available for short responses. Adding to the technical complexity is the fact that this project’s machine learning approach needs to work for any book or text, and include questions written by any user. This project will improve the accuracy and detail of assessments, particularly with written responses regarding texts new to the reader. This project will require deep-learning natural language processing (NLP) technology to fully model language representation. The proposed system will ingest the subject text and the associated question before evaluating the written response without prior submissions used as training data. The project prototype will be developed for English Language Arts instruction prior to broader deployment across other disciplines.

    \ RNA viruses, in liquid blood and especially dry, degrade rapidly.  It is why
    SARS-COV-2 is primarily a contact/aerosol transmission and not a problem with
    packages.  RNA samples have a high sensitivity to ribonucleases (enzymes that

    fixed and known amount of specimen, desiccant for drying, and modified atmospheric
    packaging (MAP) preventing specimen degradation at ambient temperature for up
    to 14 days.  The MAP prevents gas exchange during transit, enabling collection

    The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a wearable sensor that monitors ovulation hormones to aid conception.  The end product will make fertility tracking and treatment more convenient, accessible and affordable to the 7.5 million American couples currently struggling to grow their families. Patients undergoing infertility treatments typically have to visit a fertility clinic 3-8 times during a single ovulation cycle to assess circulating reproductive hormone levels in the blood. These frequent clinic visits create high costs and a burden, decreasing overall access to infertility care. This project will develop an affordable, accurate, at-home fertility-monitoring solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes research towards the development of a low-cost ovulation monitoring wearable to accurately track reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle. The proposed low-cost, wearable device will capture hormone peaks in real time. This project will demonstrate that the proposed technology can continuously monitor reproductive hormones and that the data generated of equivalent quality and accuracy compared to standard blood draws. Furthermore, the proposed research will validate the device’s ability to function over multiple days.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of ultra-clear, super-insulating aerogels. Insulated glass manufacturers have a need for improvements to existing double-pane window manufacturing.  Residential insulated glass units represent a $2 billion market in North America alone. Currently, windows in the U.S. lose $20 billion dollars in energy each winter. A double-pane window with a sheet of aerogel between glass panes can achieve a vastly improved insulation, as an aerogel thickness of just 3 mm enables a product 50% more insulating than gas-filled double-pane windows, comparable to triple-pane products. Adoption could enable cost-effective energy savings of 1.2 quadrillion BTUs by 2030. This work also extends to other markets, such as transparent doors for refrigeration and ovens, and solar thermal receivers for process heat, which also represent significant opportunities for energy savings and viable market applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address key technical barriers for integration of super-insulating aerogels in window insulated glass units by focusing on two main risks. First, the project will further improve the optical clarity of the aerogel materials. The human eye is highly sensitive to haze and defects in transparent media, and although optical clarity meeting minimum requirements for the residential window market has been achieved, further improvement and testing are needed. Clarity will be improved by reducing haze through solution-gelation recipe optimization and by removing the fundamental causes of surface defects through development of mixing and molding strategies. Second, widespread adoption also requires straightforward incorporation of aerogel into insulated glass units. Bonding methods to attach aerogels directly to glass without reducing optical clarity will be developed, which will enable simple handling and incorporation into existing insulated glass unit manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to streamline surgical training and reduce the burden of surgical complications by creating a device that can train and evaluate surgeons.  The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of progressive skills education and quantitative assessment on a simulated open surgery system. This project will develop a high-fidelity modular system and synthetic vasculature to effectively train surgeons in open vascular surgery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance development of an educational tool to support surgical training.  The device must provide progressive skills education, expose users to a comprehensive range of open surgical procedures, and provide objective feedback metrics. The proposed research will first investigate the feasibility of developing a variety of simulated vascular components, including those with abnormalities, and subsequently integrating them into the benchtop system. The synthetic training models will be evaluated by practicing surgeons using a bipolar scaling method. The mechanical properties of the synthetic vascular tissue will be measured and compared to live tissue. This project will additionally develop components to measure surgical performance. The metrics will be evaluated in a pilot study of a panel of experienced and inexperienced surgeons. The anticipated results are a synthetic vascular material with similar mechanical properties as live tissue, surgical models that are validated as realistic by a panel of expert surgeons, and a system with sensors and components that are capable of differentiating between user skill levels.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a secure domestic supply of isotopes.  The initial target isotope for production is lithium-7-hydroxide for use in US light-water nuclear reactors. Currently the only source of this critical material is China or Russia and so the supply is susceptible to disruptions that would cripple the US electrical generating capability.  A cost-effective method to enrich very large quantities of lithium-7 is also required for the introduction of next-generation nuclear reactor technology.  Molten salt reactors will deliver inherently-safe, environmentally friendly, carbon-free base load electrical power generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides an innovative approach to enriching lithium-7.  The concept is to develop a liquid-liquid method for lithium isotope separation that will work with an innovative high-speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC) system.  All commercial HSCCC suppliers (UK and China) build their bobbins by winding tubing around a shaft.  The sides of the bobbins have the inlet and outlet fittings attached.  This restricts the bobbins to only having a single inlet and outlet and having only a single tubing 'style' on a bobbin.  Using 3-D printing to manufacture bobbins enables flexibility in design and manufacture while lowering cost.  In this project, 3-D printing will enable bobbins with different configurations to be manufactured and tested quicker and cheaper than the current conventional tube winding method enabling the bobbin configurations to be quickly adapted alongside the liquid-liquid method extractant/diluent formulations to optimize performance criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the deployment of solar power in the United States. The technology can potentially make solar panels up to 16% more efficient and result in up to 10% lower costs. This enables solar power to potentially become more economically viable across larger parts of the United States. This technology can serve the existing 110 GW solar panel market. Global commercialization of the technology can increase solar energy production by 14,000 TWh and reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by 6 billion tonnes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a light conversion material that combines a light absorber material, a wide bandgap inorganic perovskite, with a highly efficient, quantum cutting near-IR emitter, a ytterbium dopant. The material is applied to existing solar panel components using a rapid vapor deposition process to create drop-in replacements, avoiding changes to the panel production process.  Traditional silicon solar panels poorly convert ultraviolet light into electricity, generating substantial waste heat and degrading panels.  The light conversion materials developed here utilizes that traditionally wasted light, thereby boosting overall panel efficiencies.  This project will confirm the feasibility of the technology for solar applications by building coupon solar modules, measuring power performance improvements, and confirming intrinsic device stability through environmental stress tests.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is through a compact and efficient means of mitigating atmospheric pollution of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a major human health and environmental hazard. Conventional wet scrubbers for SO2 removal are expensive to install and are highly limited by their large footprint, reducing the practicality of their implementation for mobile or space-limited applications. The proposed approach to SO2 capture uses electricity to directly remove the contaminant from a gas stream, providing significant improvements in energy efficiency and eliminating the need for caustic chemicals inherent to conventional SO2 scrubbers. The need for innovative solutions for SO2 removal is highlighted in the maritime shipping industry, where recent legislation on SO2 emissions has created an immediate need for technology that can be retrofitted into existing infrastructure on cargo vessels. This project can potentially be extended to many applications where electrical energy is supplied.


    The proposed method of SO2 removal uses a technique known as electro-swing adsorption (ESA), which uses a polymer-composite electrode containing an electroactive species that can capture and release a target gas through charge/discharge cycles. This technology has been demonstrated for CO2 capture, but there are significant challenges associated with developing novel chemistry for capture of SO2. Phase I research will focus on gaining a molecular understanding of the electrochemical mechanism of SO2 reactivity. The binding constant for the target gas can be ascertained as a function of the reduction potential of the electroactive species, providing a method of selecting optimized candidates for SO2 capture that are highly reactive and selective over other gases present in exhaust streams, such as CO2. The absorption capacity of the electroactive species will also be assessed using packed-bed absorption columns to simulate an electro-swing adsorption device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the ability for developers to build massively collaborative and real-time cooperative video/virtual reality applications without compromising end-end security. Lack of end-to-end encryption has been a growing problem for consumers, educational institutions and businesses collaborating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will advance the state-of-the-art by providing developers with the necessary tools to create high quality synchronous collaborative virtual environments where children, teachers, corporate professionals and even national security personnel can safely engage in work-activity without risks of privacy loss or security/data compromises. This will also benefit telemedicine where privacy is paramount from a personal perspective and also from a legal standpoint. The success of demonstrating end-end encryption for a high-performance application will result in other remote-work collaborative tools being designed with end-end security as a key feature.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project solves the problem of maintaining end-end security of content while allowing expressivity using a scripting language by separating the data plane from the control plane for such massively collaborative multimedia applications. The control plane can be programmed using a web-friendly language that can be executed on any existing user-device such as laptops/smartphones thus giving maximum portability to the app developers. The data plane always stays end-end encrypted and can be manipulated using the scripting language in a highly expressive manner. The system provides perfect forward and backward secrecy by using a fast-group rekeying protocol to maintain confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the multimedia content. Research and development on this project will lead to breakthroughs in multiple avenues including the demonstration of a truly high performant decentralized end-end encrypted application. This will spur the demand for end-end security for any remote-work collaborative application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate a platform for increasing computing power and decreasing power consumption in applications such as: datacenter search, machine learning, cell phones, and personal electronics.  By addressing the key bottleneck of data interconnects at short length scales, this project will enable new computing architectures that can learn, retrieve information, and solve problems beyond the reach of conventional computing.  The impact will range from chip companies to electronic packaging, to the system companies and ultimately to the users of computing services, from businesses to individuals.  Addressing this interconnect bottleneck will realize more powerful personal computing that consumes less power, creates more efficient data centers, and accelerates widespread adoption of new machine learning architectures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a key issue of moving data within and between computing platforms.  As the length of a datalink increases, the power consumption and density drop.  Generally electrical wires are used for length scales less than a meter, and optics are used for high speed signals over a few meters.  This project will enable a new light source based on Gallium Nitride devices, typically used in lighting and display applications.  Through this approach, optical signaling can be used at shorter distances, giving much higher density and lower electrical power consumptions.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate an optical link with 10x to 100x lower power than electrical wiring and 100x the density of traditional optical links.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve radiology and management of medical imaging equipment. The proposed analytics platform will provide detailed insight into device utilization to help oversee operations, optimize workflows, better leverage existing equipment, and evaluate the success of investments.  More efficient use of scanners is expected to substantially benefit the patient population as it will reduce the wait time for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increase patient access, shorten imaging protocols, reduce sedation duration, reduce and predict delays, and ultimately improve the patient experience. The data unlocked by the platform will also open new avenues of research for radiologists and researchers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology that repurposes the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data created by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to build a unified, query-able source of knowledge about imaging exams. This project will harmonize DICOM metadata and build upon it to create an ontology that describes all the facets of imaging exams. Areas of development include recovering acquisition duration and scanner activity through algorithms that analyze images and exams to infer when the scanner was truly active. The project also demonstrates the impact of the data source by training a machine learning model to automatically detect repeated images, a prominent source of schedule delays.  Overall, the developments from this project construct key aspects of timing and workflow from DICOM data to enable a new form of data analytics in Radiology.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance an improved system to sense and map  atmospheric conditions using nano-drones that are the size of small birds; these systems have benefited from recent innovations in miniature power electronics and flight control sensors.  The proposed project leverages the safety, cost and portability advantages of these small form factor aircraft in a system of coordinated drones flying in formation to measure wind, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations. Each flight of the swarm can cover hundreds of square miles, creating a high resolution 3D map of atmospheric properties. This enables the study of wind currents and gas movement for applications including detection of urban gas leaks, smog movement, and forest fire detection. Satellite measurements can be validated and improved through aerial measurements. This research will benefit public health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance new software to analyze and optimize nano-drones. This project will expand the understanding of miniaturized (under 100 g) drone performance and enable the development of advanced nano-drones to carry out valuable sensing missions. This project will: (1) validate an optimization framework with laboratory test data; (2) develop a novel, portable drone docking station allowing for easy launching, landing and charging of hundreds or thousands of drones by a single operator, eventually enabling fully automated use for continuous monitoring applications; and (3) develop visualization and analysis tools to facilitate data analysis.

    Phase I project is that it will answer the quest for developing a new type of
    vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft combining the competitive advantages
    of winged aircraft with those of helicopters.  Accordingly, this project will
    enable the production of a new type of VTOL aircraft that will be able to cruise
    at 640 mph; to operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet; will be cheaper to build
    and maintain, easier to fly and less prone to accidents; and will provide the
    comfort and low noise level winged aircraft enjoy. These competitive advantages
    will make this new type of VTOL aircraft more attractive to Helicopter and Business
    Aircraft manufacturers and customers, which will boost the $55 Billion/year helicopter
    and business aircraft Industry.  In addition, this project will enable the production
    of small/medium-sized, electric, VTOL Aircraft for use in metropolitan areas,
    which will provide U.S. communities with a fast, convenient, low-noise means of
    transportation for use in metropolitan areas. \n\nThe current SBIR Phase I project
    aims at confirming the feasibility of an innovative lift-generating mechanism
    to enable the production of a new type of VTOL Aircraft. The lift-generating mechanism
    employs two novel components, a compound propeller having a cascade of specially-designed
    low angle-of-attack blades positioned in close proximity to one another, and an
    airflow pattern modifier. The feasibility of these two components was suggested
    with a multi-element airfoil CFD analysis tool, motivating the prototype proposed
    here.  This project will broaden our understanding of blades operating at low
    angle-of-attack and positioned in close proximity to one another. The main objectives
    of this project are to assess the performance of the compound propeller and the
    effect of using the airflow pattern modifiers on the performance; and to estimate
    the overall disc loading and hover lift efficiency of this proposed lift-generating
    mechanism.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    Phase I project is to support reservoir de-silting. The nation has a number of
    dams and reservoirs to produce low cost-electricity. However, sediments transported
    every year by floods consume the storage capacity of dams and must be removed.
    For example, the Hoover Dam is full to a depth of only 90 ft. Similarly, some
    1430 dams are at risk of collapsing or overflowing from floods, such as the Prado
    Dam and Mojave Dam in California, and two dams collapsed in Michigan in 2020,
    flooding towns and displacing thousands of residents.  Traditional dredging costs
    $20-70 per cubic yard and poses a major barrier to restoring the storage capacities
    of those dams. This project will reduce the cost to $8 per cubic yard by switching
    from a slurry to a capsule technology. The payback would be in the 1% power capacity
    restored from lower sediment accumulation. This could also protect turbines from
    erosion. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project advances translation of a system to address
    sediment accumulation. The proposed project represents an extension of technologies
    to move pressed coal logs. The sediments are first pumped to shore from a depth
    of 50-200 ft. They are dewatered in settling ponds and excess water is returned
    to the reservoir. The dewatered sediments are then packed into large plastic capsules
    and sent to a dedicated pipeline some 30 miles away from the dam. Since the capsule
    is streamlined, it needs little water to be supported in the pipeline by hydrodynamic
    forces. For this purpose, a new natural gas fired capsule pump is developed; this
    liquid piston pump engine can pump up to 60 million gallons per day; it is also
    compact and does not need a complex system of locks and pump bypasses. It can
    be easily relocated to a new site and operates on low-cost natural gas. This transition
    from slurry to capsule pipeline technology represents a cost-effective method.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid manufacturing and on-demand microchip microfabrication capability. This is enabled by a rapid-manufacturing platform that is targeted at serving the needs of micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), Internet of Things (IoT), and MEMS in biological applications (bioMEMS) developers. The innovation will enable IoT developers to create new MEMS-based products at a fraction of the cost and time typical today. This will enable development of high-value, mass-customized IoT devices that will further stimulate growth in manufacturing, security, and a multitude of other areas.  This project will enable for the first time, a true low-cost rapid manufacturing capability for the MEMS community, thus addressing a long standing challenge in the industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address key technical questions related to the feasibility and scalability of microelectronics manufacturing to tabletop form factors. A capability required for the manufacturing platform is a wafer bonding system. Development of this key capability on a tabletop scale requires precise engineering of a complex system including precision motion controllers, cameras, kinematic fixtures, actuators, and heaters into compact modules. Furthermore, these complex modules must support and maintain sensitive environments with requirements like vacuum pressures and vibration isolation. Key questions remain such as how to maintain wafer alignment while moving between system modules, how to preserve precise registration of wafer positions through multi-axis movements, and how to attain micron-level optical resolution of alignment marks with edge-mounted optics rather than bottom-up or top-down optics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide government and regulatory bodies with better information gathering tools related to identification of special nuclear material. Due to the limitations of current radiation detection materials, physicists tasked with developing the next generation detector products often have no commercial supplier.  This project will develop special detectors that are low-cost, rugged, and amenable to large deployment. By leveraging advancements in amorphous scintillator research and materials science, this project will enable additive manufacturing of the next generation of radiation detection tools to improve global nuclear security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops high-efficiency neutron discriminating scintillator arrays capable of coupling to 64-channel detectors for the purposes of neutron event reconstruction. The additive manufacturing of organic glasses has significant challenges, such as bubble nucleation of dissolved gasses, stress cracking due to differences in coefficients of thermal expansion, and destabilization of the metastable glassy state. Any of these failure modes would lead to the loss of optical integrity required for high fidelity neutron event reconstruction. To fabricate segmented arrays of this type, the base formulation of organic glass scintillator material will be altered to adjust the glass transition temperature, and enable these materials to be cast into rigid molds. Through this approach highly complex pixelated arrays can be rapidly produced while maintain high performance.  Development will focus on low surface energy additives and covalent modifications of the fluorophores to prevent defects during casting and annealing, as well as mold materials, surface preparation, and thermal transport properties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase the productivity (speed) of manufacturing machines at low cost without sacrificing quality. The project is specifically motivated by 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), a $9 billion rapidly growing industry whose adoption for mainstream manufacturing is hindered by the low speed of 3D printers. For example, faster 3D printers can help support manufacturing of key equipment, such as personal protective equipment (PPE).  A major hindrance to high-speed 3D printing is vibration, which causes loss of quality at high-speed operation. This project seeks to develop a new approach for mitigating the vibration of 3D printers and other manufacturing machines. Because the dynamic behavior of manufacturing equipment may lead to uncertainties in software compensation schemes, this project will develop new software algorithms to address these uncertainties. The software algorithms developed through this project will not only benefit 3D printing, but would also apply a wide range of manufacturing machines, like machine tools and robots, whose speed and accuracy are often limited by vibration.

    This STTR Phase I project seek to develop two new calibration approaches that allow the filtered B spline vibration compensation software to handle uncertainty and avoid loss of accuracy due to dynamic mismatch. The first approach is robust offline calibration – i.e., calibration of the machine offline to accommodate the widest range of potential mismatch in machine dynamics. Preliminary lab-scale work has shown potential of a robust filtered basis functions to address this issue. However, remaining technical challenges of guaranteed computational efficiency and accuracy of the robust filtered basis function approach must be overcome. The second approach is adaptive online calibration – i.e., updating the calibration of the machine while it is operating in the field using vibration measurements obtained from low-cost accelerometers. To achieve this, this project will address challenges of guaranteed accuracy of adaptive online calibration using low-cost accelerometers by ensuring persistence of excitation during online calibration.

    These conditions produce high levels of stress on diseased cells compared to normal
    cells. This project leverages insights that COVID-19 uses the same pathway to
    enhance viral infection as cancer cells use for survival; this process causes
    immune system weakening which allows tumor cells and viruses to multiply.   The
    proposed project will create innovative anti-viral therapies by exploring how
    this survival pathway increases COVID-19 infectivity, weakens the immune system
    and induces tumor cell resistance. Its use can be expanded to other new targets

    between tumors and viral infections. This project will advance translation of
    a novel inhibitor to a survival factor that continually keeps these wounds from

    inhibitor can potently block the binding of COVID-19 spike protein to this survival
    factor, which has been shown to be highly expressed on stressed lung cells as

    high power electric currents to create a strong magnetic field. This magnetic
    field induces eddy currents in the workpiece, heating it and enabling it to be
    pressed into an adaptable mold. The reconfigurable mold can quickly change its
    shape to form different sections of a parabola or other freeform shape. Using
    an adjustable mold saves the cost of machining a high precision mold for each
    unique reflector segment. The adjustable mold also allows for easy correction
    of springback, mold wear, and other errors to achieve higher shape accuracy than
    other mass production processes. The low tooling cost allows this technology to
    economically produce any batch size. The project will model and test induction
    heating and forming processes, ultimately designing a workstation to produce curved
    panels.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel electromagnetic navigation system that
    offers a transformative solution for a wide range of medical procedures that demand
    accuracy, efficiency, and safety. The result of this capability and its subsequent
    commercialization will positively affect the outcomes of medical procedures for
    patients worldwide. The system will enable tracking medical instruments over the

    staff exposure to harmful radiation while being compatible with the intraoperative
    imaging. It will create and augment navigation volumes on demand during the medical
    procedures. The system will enable reliable detection and mitigation of electromagnetic
    interference.  The commercial and market potential of this solution is significant
    based on customer discovery interviews with industry representatives seeking novel
    electromagnetic navigation capabilities for minimally invasive and robotic medical
    procedures. The broader societal impacts of the technology offer flexible and
    highly customizable platforms across key industry sectors important to United

    advance the development of a new electromagnetic navigation system that requires
    solving several complex problems involving mathematics, computer science, and
    electrical engineering. Millions of minimally invasive procedures are performed
    annually worldwide which include cardiac ablations, valve replacements, bronchoscopies,
    orthopedic procedures, cancer treatments, etc.  All of these procedures are being
    treated with increasing robot utilization. Electromagnetic navigation systems
    are widely used in these procedures providing knowledge of locations and orientations
    when medical instruments are out of the “line of sight”. Currently available systems,
    developed before the wide adoption of robotic surgeries, can handle only fixed
    navigation volumes and are often unable to track instruments throughout the full
    procedure space, which may require the use of additional harmful X-ray radiation.
    The current systems use bulky field generators incompatible with imaging equipment
    and provide only limited detection and correction of electromagnetic interference-induced
    location distortion in the body. This project will address these shortcomings.
    It leverages the industry expertise and demand validation by leading companies
    in the minimally invasive and robotics markets, the efficiency and innovation
    of an experienced team, and a functional electromagnetic navigation system prototype
    developed by the company.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a demonstration of a high-quality, self-disinfecting facemask, which is safe, comfortable, and reusable, and will have an immediate impact during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The filter media used in modern facemasks are either inefficient in filtrating submicron size viruses or are difficult to breathe through and highly uncomfortable. Viruses can be active on a facemask for up to one week. With the possibility of contamination and without a self-disinfection function, facemasks must be disposed of after single use. The proposed highly efficient and self-disinfecting filtration technology will solve these problems. The reusability will also directly address the facemask supply shortage as well as waste disposal issue.  In the long term, this technology may be further applied as window screens for blocking and disinfecting airborne pathogen particles. The self-disinfection function could be adapted for other personnel protective equipment as well as for environment self-disinfection and for food packaging, etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an innovative filtration medium for a disruptive facemask technology by effectively capturing submicron particles including viruses via a nanoparticle-functionalized nanofiber mat that has high filtration efficiency and is thin with low air flow resistance.  The technology will also deactivate pathogens in-situ via the   ambient, light-enabled, photocatalytic disinfection function of nanoparticles and the subsequent synergetic effects that include physical and chemical disruption of virus membranes and their RNA/DNA. The functionalized catalysts absorb ambient light, producing reactive oxygen species to disinfect pathogens, while the plasmonic effects enhance the light absorption. The charged nanoparticles are firmly embedded on the electrospun nanofibers, and the resulted surface irregularity, the improved charge density, and the hydrophilic absorption further boost the filtration and trapping efficiency through mechanical and electrostatic capture of aerosol particles. Taken together, all these effects may lead to a highly efficient, breathable, reusable facemask with in-situ self-disinfection functionality to combat highly infectious viruses and a broad spectrum of pathogens.

    of surgical site infections (SSIs) through reducing wound drainage. Wound complications,
    namely persistent wound drainage, typically precede SSIs. Patients suffer from
    an estimated 100,000+ SSIs, associated with nearly 1 million additional inpatient-stays
    and estimated annual cost of $3.3 billion. Initially, the project has the opportunity
    to impact obese patients, as obesity and subcutaneous fat have shown to be a strong
    risk factor and risk predictor of SSI in both adults and children, this solution
    can be launched initially to support this population, representing roughly 40%
    of adults and 18% in youths.  This project will investigate a new solution to
    close surgical sites, with impacts including improved surgical efficiency and
    improved care. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
    addresses the need for reducing SSIs with improved, standardized, everted surgical
    closure with a guiderail-like solution providing uniform skin tension and accurate
    realignment when closing a wound. The proposed solution will produce 3.25x more
    wound compression than freehand closure in both linear and rounded incisions on
    a neoprene surface, with 20% reduction in trans-incision closure variability over
    hand-stapled wounds in linear incisions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to fully automate frequent and regular disinfection tasks in hospitals, care centers, commercial units, universities, schools, and other indoor spaces.  This task has become critically important in light of the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2.  By being fully automated, the proposed robotic system reduces human risk and required protective gear (as humans do not need to enter a contaminated zone to move in and position their devices) as well as human workload (due to autonomous operation of the robot system).  Current Ultra-Violet C (UVC) disinfection robots utilize integrated bulbs and have limited operation intervals due to the need to frequently recharge, the proposed solution is able to operate a wide variety of disinfection devices like UVC lamps, High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, hydrogen peroxide aerosols, and others, and thus, offers maximum versatility to the customer while also allowing for the utilization of the customer’s existing devices.  In addition, the assistive system can be instructed in natural language by non-experts and can thus be operated without prior training.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop two autonomous robots that, together, can carry out room disinfection tasks with existing equipment.  One challenge with automating disinfection, especially UVC disinfection, is the power consumption of UVC lights and the need for frequent recharging of battery-operated units on autonomous robots.  Another is that current robotic solutions have UVC devices integrated, which prevents the use of existing or custom devices. The solution to both challenges is to build a flat carrier robot where existing or custom devices can be mounted and a second robot, tethered to the carrier robot, that can power the device by docking at a purpose-made docking station connected to a wall outlet.  While the device is on, both robots will also be able to recharge their batteries and thus operate continuously.  Advanced navigation strategies are necessary to ensure that both robots can drive through indoor environments to their target locations without tangling the tether.  Both robots will be equipped with laser and camera sensors and utilize joint sensor information communicated via their tether for improving localization and navigation.  The result will be a robust autonomous multi-robot system for navigation and disinfection tasks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring climate risk management tools, including parametric insurance, to the consumer leisure travel, events, and outdoor recreation markets. This project quantifies the probability of contextually relevant weather events and presents these analytics through a suite of tools to help plan for weather variability. The project will make previously uninsurable weather and climate risks broadly insurable for the first time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a high-performance data service and application programming interface (API) for historical weather and forecast data to power an advanced machine learning data analytics front-end and an actuarial parametric weather insurance platform. The data service will access over 40 years of structured historical weather data recorded at hourly and sub-hourly temporal resolution and at spatial scales of less than 10 km, globally, in addition to multiple ensemble-based National Weather Prediction forecasts at similar spatial resolutions. This data service will power a front end capable of millions of location-specific queries and analysis requests per day. In order to accomplish the technical objective of second or sub-second access times, the open-source and proprietary software will need to be used in conjunction with existing cloud services provided by the leading cloud providers, principally caching, streaming, and scaling / load balancing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to predict a patient’s risk for developing an adverse and often lethal response to certain viral infections, such as COVID-19. This project proposes a fast and accurate test for the severity of COVID-19 infection.  The proposed assay has the potential to enable early intervention and save lives. It can potentially be used for many other infections and public health hazards beyond COVID-19.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a new technology capable of diagnosing immune response dysregulation to any infectious disease (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue, influenza, hepatitis C, etc.) that progress through an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism. While infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus begins as a mild illness, some patients experience a sudden and rapid decline in health, precipitated by a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., a “cytokine storm,” Cytokine storms cause hyperinflammation of the lungs, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality. Unfortunately, there is presently no test capable of predicting this event. This project aims to fill this medical technology gap via the development of a highly multiplexed, rapid, sensitive, disposable immunoassay specific to COVID-19 infections to be deployed at scale. The effort will include designing, building, and optimizing a prototype immunoassay based on nanopore technology innovations and analytically validating the developed technology against industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project include a high performance, low cos, dependable, novel antenna with high data bandwidth in 1000s of Gb (Tb) and high data rate speeds in 1000s of Gb/s (Tb/s). The elevated performance of this antenna, the cost effectiveness due to its 3D rapid prototype printing fabrication, and the easy integration to existing technologies may promote proliferation of wireless communications. The antenna may enable global connectivity and increase access to internet/phone connectivity for previously inaccessible areas of the globe, especially to disadvantaged and underserved communities. The high data bandwidth and speed rates will positively impact the scientific community and technologies based on data transfer such as remote learning, remote healthcare (remote surgery, patient consultation), the defense industry, telework (work from home during this COVID-19 pandemic), etc. The antenna’s technical superiority and low cost support substantial anticipated commercial success.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses critical challenges in the two emerging wireless communications systems: LEO-SATCOM (Low Earth Orbit – Satellite Communications) and 5G mobile phone/internet. This project will develop a unique antenna technology that will be integrated into satellite gateways, 5G ground terminals and also satellites in orbit. The wide aperture angle of the antenna provides a wide scanning angle capability that enables connection to highly inclined satellites. The antenna is also capable of multi-beam analysis to enable the simultaneous tracking of multiple satellites and to insure no down time during handoffs. The radiation beam pattern has excellent characteristics of high gain (Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power), very narrow beamwidth, and low cross polarization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid, inexpensive, and ultra-high throughput test to screen patients for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions.  The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing.  Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified.  The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a deep learning approach to predictive maintenance of industrial and agricultural equipment. High productivity demands and just-in-time approaches to manufacturing mean that equipment downtime can be extremely expensive;  Research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. Further, an increasing quantity of aging equipment and a maintenance workforce that is largely reaching retirement age have led to a situation where maintenance staff often lack the knowledge, training, and/or manpower to address a growing pool of aging assets. This project intends to bring forward a novel suite of intuitive and explainable technologies that can help reduce or eliminate unexpected downtime and help digitally capture and transfer expert knowledge from the retiring workforce.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a novel, deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. However, monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. This approach will not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but it will also quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions can be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Furthermore, many existing deep learning approaches lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where bad predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction.  This will allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Assistive Robots for Personal Care and COVID-19 Protection'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve COVID-19 treatments by providing imaging information to assess the severity and progression of the disease. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be sensitive to COVID-19 via the observation of ground-glass opacities and is being used on patients with acute symptoms. Practical considerations such as high radiation to the patient and cross contamination risk from moving the patient for imaging must be taken into account in the decision to image with CT. A 3D imaging solution that is low cost, low radiation, and mobile could provide advantages and bring quality of care while integrating efficiently in the hospital workflow. Along with addressing the current crisis, the usage of this solution to address other respiratory diseases would secure strong commercial potential for this research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 3D imaging reconstruction algorithm that can be used to assess the severity and progression of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Current chest imaging technologies can either provide adequate image quality or efficient imaging of the lungs, but not both. Two major advances could make the imaging more efficient while also providing the required image quality. Scatter modeling has been shown to be successful in improving image quality when reconstructing from few radiographs; Preliminary data shows how Machine Learning (ML) can be integrated to enhance efficient imaging to provide higher quality images. A 3D image creation algorithm that models X-ray scatter and uses ML to reconstruct 3D images from rapid radiographs will enable using 3D imaging for respiratory diseases including COVID-19.  This algorithm will be validated on cadaveric models to assess if an AI-enabled imaging system that is mobile, that can be used bedside, and that is easily draped for sterile utilization is feasible.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a device that effectively and reliably
    secures endotracheal tubes for babies in the neonatal intensive care unit.  Endotracheal
    tubes are airways placed in patients to help them breathe, but babies in the NICU
    experience high rates of unplanned dislodgement and early removal. These dangerous
    events are primarily attributed to poor and ineffective securement of the endotracheal
    tube to the patient. An integrated solution to endotracheal tube securement would
    reduce complications for the 80,000+ neonatal intubations that occur every year

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable low energy, low power, physically

    use the human body as a \"wire\" to achieve orders of magnitude lower power than
    today’s communication around the human body while simultaneously being physically

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the transition from chemical pesticides to non-chemical alternatives by providing farmers with a sustainable, long-term solution for managing plant diseases (e.g., fungus), while reducing agricultural impacts on human health and the environment. Organic farms lack effective fungicide treatment methods resulting in high labor costs and increased risk of yield loss. This project will develop a system for using ultraviolet light as an efficient and effective alternative for chemical treatments, by providing farmers with a healthier and more environmentally-conscious method for treating crops. The solution may eliminate chemical applications, reduce labor requirements, and increase profitability for farmers. Additionally, technologies developed as part of this project will minimize human exposure to chemical fungicides and greatly reduce the ecological damage caused by existing agricultural treatment practices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to understand how environmental and physical variabilities affect dosing of ultraviolet light in open-field strawberry production. Ultraviolet light has been shown to effectively treat pathogens including gray mold, for which there is no organically accepted treatment other than picking by hand. Ultraviolet light can be used as a non-chemical alternative for treating pathogens but is not commercially feasible due to environmental and physical variabilities that affect treatment dosing. Excessive dosing damages plants and reduces yield, while insufficient dosing is ineffective. This project will advance agricultural best practices by developing the equipment and predictive software necessary for reliably applying ultraviolet treatment on commercial farms. The project team will establish an experimental process for measuring multi-dimensional irradiance profiles as a function of physical and environmental factors, then use empirical data to establish functional relationships between variables and irradiance. Using real-time sensor feedback, the treatment system can automatically modulate exposure time and achieve desirable treatment dosing in open fields. By developing the ability of maintaining ultraviolet treatment dosages, food can be grown reliably without dangerous and costly chemical applications.

    physically handling or grasping a wide range of delicate objects. The electrically-actuated
    soft robotic gripper technology is inherently safe to work in human-occupied environments
    and collaborate with human workers since its soft fingers can deform and absorb
    impacts in case of a collision. In addition, with the data generated from the
    research and development, new use cases will be opened for robotic hands in the
    long term such as helping farmers pick fruits from trees. Working in the robotics
    technology area and targeting items that are difficult to pick up by traditional
    robotic grippers and algorithms, the research will help automate and increase
    the efficiency of traditionally manual processes that suffer from a lack of enough
    workers to ultimately support American manufacturing. This research also has longer-term
    benefits to expand into other sectors such as collaborative robotics, healthcare,
    and assistive robotics areas because of the inherent safety and adaptability of
    soft robotics in human interaction. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on technical research and development of electrically
    actuated soft grippers with a modular approach, sensory integration, and feedback
    control, as well as the study of new algorithms and user interfaces to endow these
    systems with intelligence for improved performance. When there is variation in
    object size, weight, shape, and fragility, robotic system integrators find it
    difficult to use traditional rigid and expensive grippers to automate mundane,
    low-value tasks. Soft grippers can provide a solution, adapting to variations
    in objects and other conditions. Enabling electrical operation of soft fingers
    enables direct integration with robotic arms eliminating complex infrastructure
    requirements and reducing cost, which will help improve the return on investment
    and reduce barriers of entry for small businesses to utilize this latest technology.
    The research will undertake testing and validation under common, realistic conditions
    encountered in fresh produce picking and packing and e-commerce order fulfillment
    applications. The research goals are to: optimize the design and fabrication techniques
    and quantify grasping behavior for improved adaptability, provide feedback control,

    The broader impact commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the accessibility of eye health care.  Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness but can be addressed with early detection, and the prevalence increases with age. However, existing tests can be tiring and difficult and require specialized equipment. This project will advance an inexpensive test for early detection for treatment.  This low-cost, tablet-based tool can offer universal, cost-effective glaucoma screening.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances novel retinal testing for glaucoma detection through improved modeling and data analysis of the visual system.  This project analyzes visual field test results to reveal a pair of linked cartographic maps that transmit central and peripheral retinal information to the brain through grouped retinal nerve fiber bundles segregated in a conformal mapping. A cone of photons displays the visual field information on the central S2 spherical non-Euclidean Riemann surface centered around the foveal axis, which lacks representation in the brain and can be considered as a singularity or reference region for each eye. Information on the S2 surface is transmitted through bundles of retinal nerve fibers that are grouped to represent single surfaces, and modeled as though the eye is a S3 4-dimensional hypersphere, with the blind spot being a singularity region and serving as the reference point. The retinal nerve fiber bundles transmitting the information to the brain are passively reordered at the blind spot and bring about an inversion of the Y (Up-Down) axis. Information from both eyes enables parallax removal and leads to depth perception. Information from the peripheral retinal regions of each eye is crossed across the optic chiasma and provides spatial locations of objects during peripheral vision.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the discovery of new therapeutics

    to elicit almost every signaling pathway. Drugs targeting GPCRs make up 35% of
    all FDA approved drugs, generating sales of more than $200 billion annually.  Despite
    relative success in pharmacologically targeting GPCRs they remain vastly underexploited,
    largely due to the lack of technology that addresses the characteristics and signaling
    patterns of GPCRs. The proposed project will explore the potential of GPCRs to
    help develop new drug candidates. \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project leverages genetically encoded fluorescent GPCR sensor technology
    to address several challenging but necessary characteristics of GPCR targeted
    drug discovery: selectivity despite close sequence and structural homology, precise
    signal modulation within the continuum of receptor activation/ deactivation states
    and downstream signaling, in many cases the absence of a known endogenous ligand,
    and the ability to monitor compound activity (pharmacodynamics) directly in vivo
    in real-time. The proposed technology reflects ligand-dependent changes in GPCR
    conformation in real-time and directly reports ligand-receptor interactions, the
    primary determinant of signal generation in continuum. The technology can be readily
    implemented in high-throughput formats and universally adapted for a broad exploration
    of all GPCR targets. GPCR sensor technology provides unprecedented spatial and
    temporal resolution critical for in vivo analysis and enables precise measurements
    of the dynamic changes of receptor conformation. Therefore, it is well suited
    for the exploration of functionally selective compounds. Furthermore, by harnessing
    the sensitivity and selectivity of GPCR sensor technology, compounds that activate
    allosteric receptor sites through heterodimerization can be discovered. Ultimately,
    compounds discovered using the GPCR sensor technology are expected to be more

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a system to improve pharmaceutical manufacturing and sepsis treatment. A toxic substance known as endotoxin is a common contaminant in many types of therapeutics, and it is the primary cause of batch rejection in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The economic impact of pharmaceutical batch failure due to contamination is high due to loss of product and facility closure for cleaning. The endotoxin removal market within drug manufacturing was valued at $315 million in 2018 and is expected to grow due to the increase in biopharmaceutical products. Additionally, endotoxins are dangerous when they enter patients’ bloodstream and can cause various medical complications, including sepsis.  The technology has the potential to remove endotoxins from patients’ bloodstream more effectively than current solutions  This project will develop a universal high-efficiency endotoxin removal filter that has the potential to not only improve drug manufacturing but also provide a life-saving treatment for sepsis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a high-affinity, high-specificity filter for endotoxin removal by using a protein that specifically binds endotoxin and has been shown to remove 99.9% of endotoxin from protein preparations. Traditionally, the use of proteins for product separations cause problems with durability and protein density, stability, and activity. These problems are overcome with unique materials that allow 100% incorporation of active proteins via a stable fusion with substantially increased protein stability. The binding capacity of the materials for endotoxin similar to current solutions (5,000,000 EU/mL) would be considered successful, although the binding capacity is expected to greatly exceed the current standard. Current solutions are compatible with only specific types of therapeutics. A prototype filter will be evaluated for endotoxin separation and protein recovery for three protein therapeutics. An 80% recovery of each therapeutic is expected, with simultaneous removal of 5,000,000 EU/mL of endotoxin. These tests will prove the technical feasibility of the prototype filter by showing the materials have a significantly higher binding capacity for endotoxin than current methods and that they are compatible with multiple types of therapeutics.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a smart cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
    shunt system to improve the treatment of hydrocephalus, called “water on the brain”.
    Despite being the most common pediatric brain surgery performed worldwide, 40%
    of CSF shunts fail within the first year and nearly all fail within 10 years,
    leading to increased patient morbidity as well as unnecessary revision surgeries.
    In fact, adverse events related to shunts arguably account for the majority of

    surgeries cost the global healthcare system at least $2 billion annually from
    intermittent emergency room admissions, imaging, care of complications, and other
    factors associated with failed shunts. The current solutions do not account for

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to digitize access to high-quality custom prosthetic and orthotic devices. This will increase convenience and reduce the cost of care for millions of people with limb loss or other disabilities. In 2018, the leading cause of amputations was complications from diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases, and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older. Despite progress in other aspects of prosthetic limb design, inefficiencies in the design and manufacture of the custom prosthetic socket still exist. The proposed technology uses a computational approach to digitize the biomechanical design required to develop high-quality, custom prosthetic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to digitize and automate customization of wearable devices that conform to the portion of a person’s limb remaining after an amputation. The function of this device (i.e. prosthetic socket) is to re-distribute pressure to areas of the person’s soft tissues that tolerate those pressures. This project will introduce new guidelines and processes for prosthetic socket design. The objectives include: (1) codify, modify, and implement existing design guidelines within a biomechanics engine to manage customizations for the individual user; and (2) implement a machine learning framework using training datasets of paired limbs and prosthetic sockets. The techniques developed by this work can be extended to other biomechanical processes with load/pressure transfer considerations beyond prosthetics.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to disrupt renal replacement therapy (RRT)

    patients in the United States (US) require RRT each year, with only 52,000 patients
    receiving PD, despite it having a lower cost of care. PD adoption has been limited
    due to high rates of peritonitis, which occurs in over 30% of PD patients each
    year and is linked to 1 out of 6 PD patient deaths. This project will reduce the
    risk of infection in PD, providing current patients with safer care and enabling
    more RRT patients to receive PD. This would save the US healthcare system over
    $100 million annually in peritonitis-related hospitalizations. \n\nThis Small

    caps leave catheter ends vulnerable to contamination when removed for treatment.
    This project aims to develop a device that demonstrates sufficient microbial disinfection

    a closed system eliminates the risk of secondary contamination events. However,
    significant concerns exist with regards to exposure of the patient’s abdomen to
    the antimicrobial solution. To address this, rodent animal studies will be conducted

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the risk of patients experiencing a severe drop in body temperature during surgery, known as inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH). In the United States, 57.5 million procedures are performed annually with significant risk of IPH and an estimated 22 million surgical patients develop clinical complications associated with IPH. IPH leads to increased wound infections, blood loss, cardiac problems, increased use of mechanical ventilation, and longer stays in hospital, contributing to 1 million excess inpatient days and $1.6 billion in yearly costs. The proposed technology will develop a novel device to prevent IPH, saving an estimated $2,000-$3,500 per patient or $1 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to create a body heat transfer model that accurately integrates the novel device with a tissue model of the lower limb. The resulting model will enable in silico evaluation of device performance (heat output), efficacy (heat transfer), and safety (burn risk) across a broad clinical setting (expanded surgical procedures and patient demographics). We will collect clinical data from a proof-of-concept feasibility study to create and validate a model.  Further simulation in support of prototype development efforts enable the optimization of critical parameters. Physical prototypes (including sub-components) will be developed and manufactured based on the optimized design. Prototypes will be evaluated for thermal performance under controlled bench-top tests, with empirical results compared to expected values generated by the model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a reliable, economically viable, and cost-effective domestic supply of cobalt, nickel, and manganese by harvesting critical metals from spent lithium ion batteries. These critical metals are needed in modern infrastructure, transportation and communication. Today, the United States imports 78% of cobalt it consumes annually but recycles only 5% of cobalt-containing lithium-ion batteries. Replacing cobalt with nickel and manganese in these batteries puts supply of those metals at risk. This project proposes a straightforward recovery process to create supply chain stability, more economic activity through recyclers and less landfilling of potentially dangerous lithium ion batteries. The project aims to create standalone processing units that can be added to existing battery processing to create a refined source of these key metals for domestic use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new approach to lithium ion battery recycling by integrating a metal sulfide sorbent technology into a capacitive deionization (CDI) electrochemical system for scalable and efficient recovery of cobalt, nickel, and manganese from spent batteries. CDI is an emerging process for removing charged species from a feed solution using porous electrodes. This work pairs CDI with efficient metal-sulfide sorbents by integrating the sorbent material into the cathodes for efficient recovery of critical metals from black mass leach solution. While CDI has typically involved carbon cathodes, metal sulfide sorbents have been selected for surface doping owing to their remarkable stability, adsorption capacity, and expected amenability to casting. The proposed work will: 1)  demonstrate viable cation uptake from black mass into the sorbent material; 2) construct a capacitive deionization cell with the sorbent material integrated into the cathode for increased recovery; and 3) demonstrate recovery with appropriate selectivity toward cobalt, nickel, and manganese separations from black mass using a novel CDI cell.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the growth and processing parameters of a methane-reducing seaweed feed additive for ruminant livestock (i.e,. cattle). Globally, livestock methane emissions contribute up to 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%. The proposed project will advance this as a feed additive at scale by exploring three novel solutions for natural lighting optimization in land-based cultivation systems, profiling and integrating aquaculture wastewater (AWW) as a circular nutrient stream, and deploying an alternative processing method to the energy-intensive industry standard. These growth processes can likely be applied to algae production for other uses, such as food, while drying innovations are expected to be broadly applicable in tropical climates.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will build on work to grow Hawaiian Asparagopsis taxiformis in land-based systems and optimize for both yield and concentration of desired metabolites. Diurnal changes in solar position and irradiance, along with occlusion caused by algae self-shading, result in photosynthetic inefficiencies.  AWW contains large amounts of waste nitrogen and phosphorus; only 20-30% of nitrogen from the fish feed is retained in fish biomass. The integration of AWW will recover some of these nutrients and avoid downstream consequences of pollution, such as eutrophication. While drying material is important for the production of a shelf-stable product, existing technologies are either energy-intensive or perform poorly at retaining critical compounds in seaweed tissue. The project will test proposed solutions to this quandary, as well as contamination and strain development.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel on-board sensor for detecting oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in diesel exhaust streams with a sensitivity and specificity unmet by existing technologies. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot accurately precisely control their exhaust systems due to the lack of appropriate cost-effective sensors capable of differentiating between NOx and other species in the exhaust stream. The proposed sensor can result in 10% fuel efficiency improvements.  Use of this sensor at scale will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments in a form factor similar to those of existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a vaccine to prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  The proposed project is a novel vaccine that activates multiple components of the immune system, potentially more effective than other SAR-CoV-2 vaccines, and using a well-understood approach as a protein-based vaccine.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance a protein vaccine based upon a platform technology combining two functions, activating the immune system and targeting it to attack to a specific pathogen or cell.  The platform has a modular design that allows it to be re-engineered, in a cassette-like fashion, to redirect the attack to different targets.  Applications for the technology include vaccines against viruses and cells infected by viruses, as well as against specific cancer types.  The vaccine can be rapidly generated and easily re-engineered. The focus of this project will be to produce this SARS-CoV-2 targeted protein vaccine utilizing an immune-activating platform with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inserted into the targeting domain of the platform. The will be followed by studies to demonstrate the vaccine candidate activity in an in vitro model and an animal model.

    was growing 27% annually prior to COVID-19. Furthermore, peer support for mental
    health increases engagement in self-care decreases substance use and depression,
    particularly for vulnerable populations. The project will advance the use of machine
    learning for voice mental health biomarkers in a group setting. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will define voice biomarker
    features for a deep reinforcement learning based system. This project will advance
    a voice biomarker technology that can serve as fast behavioral health diagnostic,
    potentially superseding the current paper-based PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tests. The priority
    is to scale the optimal mix of individuals and activities for group therapy based
    on reward functions that maximize improvements in depression and anxiety scores.
    The major technical challenges include: (1) capturing nonverbal cues in a video;
    (2) interpreting multi-speaker audio processing; (3) creating deep reinforcement
    learning models to serve relevant group matches and follow-up exercises; and (4)
    building engaging visual feedback of progress from group meetings. The anticipated
    technical result of this innovation will be to define voice biomarker features
    and reward functions for a deep reinforcement learning based system in clinically
    relevant settings to improve depression and anxiety treatment outcomes.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable drug discovery for life-threatening
    diseases. A group of proteins involved in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders,
    as well as many proteins inside bacteria and viruses, are desirable therapeutic
    targets due to their role in disease. Designing therapeutics to regulate these
    proteins is difficult because of their challenging structural features. Specifically,
    these proteins constantly shift shapes instead of remaining rigid like existing
    therapeutic targets. This project aims to develop a computational-experimental
    platform to facilitate the discovery of therapeutics for shape-shifting proteins.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project facilitates
    structure-based drug discovery for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a
    class of flexible proteins implicated in life-threatening diseases. The extreme
    flexibility of IDPs enables their diverse cellular functions, but obscures experimental
    details about their conformations. Because of this, traditional drug discovery
    methods have lacked the structural details needed to design and optimize ligands
    that regulate IDPs, and no drugs have been successfully developed that target
    IDPs. The first aim of this project is to develop an AI-chemistry-based molecular
    dynamics algorithm for accurately modeling conformations adopted by a given IDP.
    In the second aim, these structural models will be coupled with NMR fragment screens
    in order to obtain detailed models of the interactions between the proof-of-concept
    IDP and any small molecule fragments observed to bind the IDP. In the third aim,
    the structural models will direct the fusion, extension, and optimization of promising
    fragments to design lead candidates for regulating the proof-of-concept IDP, and
    biophysical experiments will validate and guide computational hypotheses. Together,
    these aims provide a systematic platform for structure-based drug discovery for
    IDPs, as well as a set of lead candidates for targeting the proof-of-concept protein.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a remote monitoring system that can alert caregivers to relapses in opioid use. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions billions per year.  Most tools to help people stay in recovery have low or mixed success rates. Reducing relapse saves lives and families and it reduces rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. In this proposal machine learning and pattern recognition, both forms of artificial intelligence (AI) will be aid identification of and response to potential relapse.  Benefits include conserving emergency response resources, but more importantly, improving long-term intervention success.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility of identifying and predicting a future state of craving / obsession or relapse using physiological and smartphone data, a use-case where physiologically underpinned alerts alter current care coordination workflows, and a use-case where relapse after discharge from inpatient facilities for rehabilitation can be significantly averted. Technical objectives include: 1) devise a novel data-driven framework for accurately and objectively estimating probability for relapsing into opioid use using individualized classification models; 2) Deploy and assess efficacy of model risk stratification system and monitoring dashboard at addiction treatment centers through feedback from managed care providers; 3) Assess and compare efficacy of craving vs. prediction models for just-in-time interventions vs. standard practices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of new therapeutics against coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19. Few broad-spectrum antivirals exist, and vaccines are effective but strain-specific and require development time for each new strain. This project will engineer probiotics native to the upper respiratory tract of humans to serve as antiviral and antibacterial agents.  These probiotics will inhibit viral entry inside human lung cells and stop lung inflammation that causes lethal severe acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. This development will be enabled by modern synthetic biology techniques and an agile research and development paradigm.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will advance the development of new probiotics. These benign, non-virulent microbes will be equipped with defensins, protegrins and compstatins. Defensins are peptides known to inhibit critical steps in viral infection, including the antagonistic binding of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the human cell receptor thought to facilitate Covid-19 entry inside lung epithelial cells. Protegrins are broad spectrum antimicrobials, with strong activity against bacteria, such as pneumonia-causing Klebsiella spp. and viral particles, including enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Compstatin is a complement system inhibitor that modulates the overactivation of inflammatory responses, which in the case of a coronavirus infection results in severe acute respiratory syndrome. At the end of this project, a library of live biotherapeutics will be developed that can exhibit antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity when expressing and secreting combinations of peptides.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address a key challenge in the response to COVID-19, namely manufacturing sufficient quantities of novel therapeutics and vaccines. This project can shorten the development times of drugs by as much as 6 months, accelerating translation of new therapeutics. This technology will also enable more testing, thereby increasing the performance and potentially reducing the side effects of these drugs.

    This SBIR Phase I project advances the manufacturing of biologics, which starts with a high performing clonal cell line derived (by definition) from a single cell. Developing such a cell line today takes up to 6 months due to iterative screening and testing to assure quality and performance. The proposed project aims to enable selection of a high performing cell clone in one day compared to many months by using a proprietary single cell proteomics platform, at an unprecedented throughput rather than lengthy, iterative selection, clonal expansion and analytics.

Being able to quantify and track viral loads at low concentration and high accuracy will expedite tests, reduce false negatives, and accelerate vaccine and drug development to combat COVID-19, and future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop innovative fluorescent probes based on high-brightness fluorophores/dyes (HBFs) that offer tunable extinction coefficients up to several thousand times higher than commercial dyes. Based on this HBF platform technology, we will be able to create high-brightness qPCR probes that can specifically quantify viral RNAs by strong and tunable fluorescent signals at fewer amplification cycles and minimum replication errors. The activity, efficiency, and specificity of high-brightness qPCR probes will be evaluated in the project.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel device to detect COVID-19,
    its derivative strains, and new, unknown viruses in pre-symptomatic environments.
    Current methods depend on knowing the viral structure and/or producing antibodies
    to specific, known viral proteins.  This project will provide pre-symptomatic
    virus detection using a standard throat or nasal swab in a rapid point-of-care
    format (20 minutes) for preemptive detection of emerging viral infections of both
    known and unknown origin. The project integrates machine learning with novel devices.
    This could potentially alleviate social distancing concerns, particularly in special
    environments, such as nursing homes and schools. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project employs cellular phenotyping to detect viral infection
    of cells. A cell’s phenotype is the particular cell’s morphology, functionality
    and otherwise observable characteristics which result from the specific combination
    of its present genomic and protein expression. This project combines a novel computer
    vision algorithm with lithographically-prepared, highly-characterized microchip
    substrates that impart specific, quantifiable, physical, and chemical cues to
    cells. This enables in-vitro observation of their responses and to quantitatively
    characterize cell phenotype and detection of meaningful cell behavior deviations
    or anomalies due to the onset of cellular viral infection. This project will demonstrate:
    1) the capability of a machine vision image analysis algorithm to extract the
    most relevant datasets; and 2) the ability to detect meaningful feature vectors
    due to infection onset. The anticipated technical results are to characterize
    cell phenotype through in-vitro studies, demonstrate the use of infected cell
    phenotype features to diagnose viral infections with traditional modes of light
    microscopy, and describe the phenotyping of cell lines infected with a SARS-CoV-2-like
    coronavirus.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the development of vaccines and anti-virals with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This project will develop technology to detect changes in virus-infected cells days or weeks before they can be detected manually. This will accelerate studies for novel anti-viral compounds characterizing their effectiveness on rapidly mutating viral strains, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. This will impact COVID-19 research and general virology.

    This SBIR Phase I project will investigate AI techniques to accelerate testing of anti-viral agents in plaque assays for the development of vaccines and anti-virals. These assays measure the number of infectious viral particles in a sample by observing the effects of infection on a culture of susceptible cells.  Currently, the assay takes 2-14 days because several rounds of infection are necessary to ensure an accurate reading. This project will advance AI techniques to automatically detect infected cells in microscopy images without human intervention or time-consuming preparations, thereby increasing the throughput for these assays. To achieve this goal, this project will: 1) Collect a time-course of microscopy images of infected cell cultures for training an AI model to measure virus infections automatically on large cell culture plates; 2) Investigate microscopy image acquisition approaches with respect to ease of integration in existing workflows and image quality; 3) Evaluate the suitability of various AI techniques; 4) Determine the detection accuracy and compare it with traditional assays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel smartphone-based method for symptom monitoring and screening for chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Current methods of evaluating respiratory diseases are not easily accessible or do not scale to screen large populations. The proposed technology will enable detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases to anyone with access to an internet-connected microphone (e.g., smartphone), using voice as an indicator.  The technology will administer simple tests in minutes and deliver results in seconds, without requiring specialized user training. The anticipated outcome is a widespread, real-time screening, monitoring and exacerbation warning system that remotely analyzes voice signals for patients with chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop voice-based classifiers that diagnose COVID-19 and monitor the severity of the disease. Existing algorithms that detect vocal biomarkers in breath and speech indicative of lung function and respiratory disease will be extended to incorporate COVID-19 signatures. Audio recordings from patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test will be collected to extract micro -signatures and develop algorithms to automatically recognize and map patterns to clinical findings and reported symptoms. The research objectives include developing: (1) A binary classifier that differentiates symptomatic and asymptomatic patients; (2) A multi-class classifier that correlates (in future predicts) changes in the severity of a patient’s symptoms when provided a series of voice samples (3) Developing a dashboard for physicians that provides up to date reports and visualizations of the cross sectional and longitudinal analytics (4) An API giving lung function metrics and classifiers available for integration into 3rd party IT infrastructure.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of a tool for caregivers
    and educators of children with speech impairments, particularly those with autism
    spectrum disorder. Left untreated, these impairments have lasting impacts on quality
    of life but remain difficult and expensive to treat; the market for autism treatment
    is estimated at $3.2 B worldwide. This project will expand the capabilities to
    provide treatment in non-clinical settings. The technology to be developed will
    include automated evaluation of speech development levels in the absence of a
    speech pathologist. In addition, technology will be pioneered that allows activities
    and lessons to be individually customized and continuously updated for each learner.
    These two advances will form the technological core of a new product designed

    speech impairment associated with autism spectrum disorder. Artificial intelligence
    will be applied to two fundamental challenges, the automated determination of
    speech development levels in the absence of a speech pathologist; and the assignment
    of activities and lessons in response to user input. This project will collect
    labeled text from language learners at various stages of development to form a

    engines to make learning assessments independent of a clinician. In parallel,
    the development and application of a business rules management system will allow
    the platform to accept user input such as an image, word, or phrase; and it will
    output new words and phrases for the learner to attempt. The system will follow
    a decision logic that considers the both the user input and the previously assigned
    language development level. The goal of this research is to produce algorithms
    that closely match the labeled assessments of language development and decision
    logic that assigns activities appropriate for each level.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new device for conducting blood tests at home or in smaller clinical settings. The platform will be fully electronic, portable, low-cost, and using advanced artificial intelligence techniques.  This proposed analyzer provides information normally obtained from costly high-end commercial equipment at much lower cost, enabling new diagnosis and monitoring for many different conditions. Additionally, the ultra-compact modules developed here will be applicable to a broad range of assays beyond complete blood count analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to build and characterize an ultra-compact all-electronic cytometer with a fully plastic cartridge capable of quantifying the key cellular components in a complete blood cell count (CBC) test including: red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, hemoglobin (hgb) concentration, and hematocrit levels. An impedance cytometer will be developed in conjunction with machine learning to discriminate between RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, while estimating hgb and hematocrit levels with less than 15 ul of blood. The primary goal is to engineer a cartridge that can work with the reader while being manufacturable in high volume with ultra-low cost. The research will involve fabrication and testing an integrated microfluidic biosensor, developing data-driven software for accurate classification of blood cell types using impedance cytometry data, building ultra-compact pocket-sized hardware and a smartphone application, and finally benchmarking and testing of prototype accuracy against a standard.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances a new type of drug delivery. Protein-based drugs (biologics) have become more popular due to their high specificity of activity and generally low level of side effects. Biologics treat many conditions, impact lives of millions of patients, and have a global revenue of over $100 B. Patients prefer and comply with injectable versions of biologics because injections are rapid and make home-administration possible, unlike IV infusions that require clinic visits lasting several hours. However, the development and utility of many biologics is hampered by their inability to be used via injections because they are thick liquids. The technology developed in this project will act as an early-stage screening to determined the suitability of potential drug formulation for injection, enabling delivery of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will increase the number of injectable protein-based therapeutics by providing early screening of protein formulation viscosity. Viscosity measurements early in formulation development are currently not possible because the existing viscometers require high material volumes. Therefore, injectability of new protein-based formulations cannot be tested until significant amounts of material are developed, typically at late stages of preclinical research. This project will create a high-throughput viscometer that requires only drops for each test, for formulation optimization; it will determine the feasibility of multiplexing microfluidic quartz sensors on the same substrate to achieve simultaneous viscosity measurements. Specifically, in this project, 1) the electronics for the multiplexed sensors will be developed, 2) the multiplexed sensors will be designed using analytical and finite element models, and 3) these designs will be executed by microfabrication. Finally, the multiplexed microfluidic quartz sensors will be tested by analyzing relevant formulations simultaneously.

It will be able to roll and walk, serving as a novel, general purpose unmanned ground vehicle (UGV).  Its ability to operate in diverse, highly unstructured environments enables it to support disaster recovery, humanitarian relief, and first responder applications; agricultural monitoring; industrial inspection tasks; and ultimately planetary exploration, such as surveying the lunar surface.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of the key enabling technology to realize Spaceballs -- the design, development, and characterization of a compact, high-bandwidth, high-power linear electromagnetic actuator.  Multi-body physics simulations will be used to determine required actuator performance characteristics for potential operational scenarios to inform the design of a linear actuator prototype.  The developed prototype will be characterized via testbed experiments that evaluate actuator power and bandwidth, which will in turn be used to develop actuator motion controls.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed prototype, the actuator will be installed in a single degree of freedom testbed to experimentally characterize the system’s maximum jump height, hopping bandwidth, and movements required for rolling locomotion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a rapid, point-of-care device that allows for the precision management of blood clotting (coagulation) disorders and therapies.  The proposed technology will support the development of a fully-automated reader system, along with single-use disposable cartridges, to enable clinical testing of COVID-19 patients with blood clotting issues. Due to the severe inflammation that occurs during COVID-19 disease, these patients often require frequent testing for blood clotting disorders. The proposed technology will rapidly identify patients that are more likely to form blood clots, and it can help evaluate the effectiveness of their current regimens; this will have impact beyond the current pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project allows for the determination of coagulation factor-specific inhibition and/or deficiency and real-time monitoring of response to treatment. The development of a point-of-care, portable, small volume coagulation assay that can be used for anticoagulant management using a precision-medicine approach would enable the identification of coagulation factor-specific inhibition, and, therefore, prove to be an essential tool in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulation disorders. This diagnostic would also be able to be used in non-COVID-19 anticoagulant management, aiding the identification and quantification of anticoagulants in an emergency and surgical setting and in other high-risk patients, such as neonates.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide timely and highly localized climate forecasts, plus information such as extreme heat and frost risk, to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Climate forecasting at sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales is challenging, yet essential for proactive risk management of extreme natural hazards.  This project will leverage artificial intelligence and cloud computing to implement a data-intensive approach for revolutionizing global climate forecasting. The project will provide efficient and accurate seasonal forecasts at relatively low computational cost in a user-friendly web environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop a localized, timely, and reliable climate forecasting system that is industry-focused and crop-specific. In this project, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques will be deployed to advance operational climate forecasting skill at a global scale. While conventional forecasts are trained exclusively on observational data, this project will train models on historical simulations and reanalysis, then evaluate them with observations. In this approach, the training dataset is substantially larger, consequently improving accuracy. This processing at scale is enabled with cloud resources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a diagnostic technology capable of identifying the drivers of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), which promises to enable new therapeutic options for a large population of under-served patients. AF is the most common and complex cardiac arrythmia. AF patients are at severe risk of complications including stroke, heart attack and death. AF patients have limited treatment options and medications are only effective approximately half of the time. Ablation is highly effective at treating other arrythmias, but current diagnostic mapping technologies are limited in the ability to provide customized treatment for chronic AF. This project will test concepts of a new device to measure AF.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the ability of a novel micro-electrode array to accurately measure AF in an animal. This is important because conventional intra-cardiac catheters lack the spatial resolution to adequately resolve discrete, closely spaced activations. Accurate resolution of cardiac tissue activations is essential to deduce the properties of diseased tissue and to plan effective patient-specific ablation therapy. Optical mapping is a gold standard for measuring electrical activation of tissue and therefore provides a trusted platform for comparative validation. The expected results are to observe complex activation patterns on an ovine heart model using the novel micro-electrode array, and for those electrical patterns to be corroborated by optical mapping data.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to
    reduce errors and improve accuracy, standardization, agreement, and reporting
    in evaluation of COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest computed tomography (CT)
    images. Chest CT procedures play a critical role in COVID-19 patients but current
    methods for evaluating chest CT images lack accurate, quantitative, or consistent
    information, leading to text-based reports that are difficult to interpret. The
    proposed AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow will efficiently capture the fraction
    of lung involvement and improve communication with clinicians by providing a standardized
    graphical report, key images of important findings, and structured text. The quantitative
    data will standardize reporting on an individual patient basis and provide data
    for population-level analyses, thereby offering the potential to significantly
    advance scientific knowledge of COVID-19 lung disease on a national level. \n\nThis
    STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow
    to rapidly and objectively quantify the percentage of lung involvement, classify
    lung involvement using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), track
    common and uncommon COVID-19 lung findings, and automatically generate summary
    reports with a graph, key images, and structured text. The standard-of-care for
    assessing and reporting COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest CT images involves
    dictated text-based reports that are subjective, highly variable, inefficient
    to generate and interpret, prone to errors, incomplete, and qualitative with data
    provided in an unstandardized format. The proposed AI-assisted COVID-19 chest
    CT workflow will reduce interpretation errors and omissions and improve accuracy,
    standardization, inter-observer agreement, efficiency, and reporting in evaluation
    of COVID-19 disease severity and response to treatment. This project will validate
    the working prototype with a team of expert clinicians.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be significant for helping senior caregivers optimally understand and respond to cognitive changes in older adults through a new Virtual Reality (VR) The project will result in a high-quality, effective training module for helping senior caregivers optimally understand and respond to cognitive changes in older adults. This will enhance the competence, confidence, and motivation of their nursing staff, and help reduce staff turnover. The solution will empower caregivers to effectively attend to the needs of the elderly in a way that enhances seniors’ quality-of-life and facilitates ‘aging in place,’ hence contributing towards increasing well-being among the elderly population and alleviating the societal costs of aging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge of developing VR content that effectively promotes caregiver knowledge acquisition, skill development, and motivation increases, while keeping the training experience relatively brief and efficient. Unlike simple memorization of information, positive psychological outcomes like enhanced motivation are challenging to generate. This project will strategically employ cinematic directing techniques at key points in the VR training - a new  approach to VR training. The solution leverages principles from the cognitive neuroscience of learning to deliver innovations in VR content design, analysis and delivery. Research objectives include: (1) building an engaging VR training module centered around teaching empathy and communication skills, which is enhanced with cinematic directing elements, (2) assessing the usability and feasibility of the developed content for achieving the desired outcomes in the short- and long-term, (3) building and assessing a VR training module centered around teaching observation and behavioral skills to senior caregivers, which includes embedded interactive testing elements.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop personalized clinical decision-making
    in cancer care. An estimated 17 million cases of cancer are diagnosed globally
    each year. Over $90 billion per year is spent in total on cancer-related health
    care in the U.S., and cancer patients pay over $4 billion out of pocket for health
    care. Therapeutic strategy selection and clinical trial research targeted to oncology
    become exponentially complex when unique types of cancer are considered, as well
    as how they may uniquely impact gender, race, ethnicity, and age of affected populations.
    The proposed technology will develop advanced bioinformatics models and visualization

    several innovations: a) Transfer Learning to Scale Available Data:  Since cancer
    survival modeling is limited in many cancer types due to lack of data, we will
    demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning in this context. b) Single Recurrent
    Neural Network: We will implement a recurrent neural network to improve performance
    and allow a single network to be trained across all cancer types and patient population
    characteristics. c) Control Feature Mediation Analysis: We will develop accurate

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative method to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). UGIB results in more than 550,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone with a mortality rate of up to 20%. The gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding market is projected to be nearly USD 1 billion by 2026, with the overall hemostatic agents market reaching over USD 5 billion. Current solutions require endoscopy performed by a specialist or hospital admission. The proposed approach is a drinkable formulation to stop bleeding after ingestion, eliminating the need for endoscopic intervention or hospitalization. The technology developed in this project could then be applied to other bleeding scenarios, including field/combat medicine or rapid treatment of hemorrhage during surgical complications. The gel can also be used as a drug delivery vehicle for a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new approach to achieve hemostasis in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), based on a novel thermosensitive gel (thermogel) formulation. The drinkable formulation is liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a mucoadhesive gel when warmed to body temperature, thereby treating hemorrhage in the upper GI tract without the need for endoscopic intervention. Its action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) The in situ gelation of the mucoadhesive thermogel provides a mechanical barrier against blood flow, and (2) the slow release of drugs from the thermogel at the hemorrhage site enables more rapid healing. Initial efforts will be dedicated to formulation development wherein compatibility of the thermogel with different drug candidates will be evaluated, and optimization of the gelation temperature will be performed. The best formulations will then be tested in vitro for stability, drug release kinetics, and mucoadhesion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach will be assessed in preclinical models of bleeding, demonstrating its superior ability to reach hemostasis. This is expected to apply to disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and oral mucositis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project would be the development of a neurorehabilitation technology with a total addressable market of $54B and the opportunity to increase access to advanced care for the 5.2 million people in the US living with paralysis and the 1.3 million people each year that experience an extreme neurological injury or diagnosis that can lead to severe gait impairment. This technology will encourage a proactive approach to care, eliminate the need for a clinician to be physically present in the rehabilitation experience, and introduce software solutions to increase motivation and connectivity. Clinically, if successful, this technology could dramatically decrease secondary complications, help people regain the ability to walk, and ultimately reduce costs associated with neurological diagnoses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is to develop an at-home gait trainer for rehabilitation and physical therapy of individuals with neurological injuries or neurological conditions using a patient-centered approach. This project integrates at-home advanced medical technology with telemedicine physical therapy.  This will enable continued rehabilitation and physical therapy without clinical oversight via training videos.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase aquaculture productivity by reducing disease impact. Disease costs billions in losses each year to the aquaculture industry and threatens the global food supply. The disease caused by White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) can devastate a shrimp farm and costs over $1 billion in losses each year. Farmers are often unaware of a disease issue until animals show advanced signs of disease or there are mortalities. Laboratory diagnosis is expensive and results take days-to-weeks, which is often far too long for results to be actionable. Early warning of white spot disease can enable farmers to take immediate action to reduce losses, reducing costs and increasing industrial robustness.  This project advances a new diagnostic to quickly, easily, and reliably detect WSSV in cultivated shrimp in a new easy-to-use, on-site test.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance translation of a novel diagnostic for WSSV in a technology incorporating engineered proteins with specific targets into a paper-based biosensor. Prior studies demonstrated proof-of-concept with a paper-based immunoassay with polymerization-based amplification for detection of protein-based biomarkers for HRP2–the primary protein biomarker of malaria–with sensitivity as low as 70pM. This project will bioengineer thermostable rcSso7d DNA-binding proteins to bind the WSSV target and incorporate them into the paper testing format. Assay sensitivity, reagent composition, and dynamic range will be explored as part of an effort to understand the biological and functionally meaningful limits of the developed assay. Tasks include a WSSV challenge study to evaluate the sampling parameters and detection limits of the prototype in laboratory cultured shrimp. The resulting prototype will rapidly and selectively bind the WSSV target and yield stable, easily interpretable, colorimetric results.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve math education by integrating cognitive and behavioral approaches to learning. This project will develop a novel data-driven approach to understanding the underlying root cause of students' mathematics struggles to enable appropriate interventions in a practical solution addressing the needs of educators of all grade levels and content.  This will be particularly important in a virtual learning environment, such as that generated in the COVID-19 crisis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates cognitive, behavioral, and learning research. The innovation will add measures of self-control to existing cognition measures.  This development is important because of the high variation in behavioral responses across learners. This innovation is expected to help develop independent, self-regulated learners by enabling the delivery of evidence-based teaching (EBT) with fidelity.

    Phase I project will be to empower researchers to make bio-structure discoveries
    by eliminating computational bottlenecks to shorten drug discovery cycles and
    time-to-market, such as those needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most modern
    drug discovery projects start with protein target identification and verification
    to obtain a 'verified drug target'. Structural vaccinology is a rational approach
    to generate an effective vaccine. For instance, knowing the structures of the
    proteins on the surface of the virus can guide vaccine design, and knowing the
    structures of viral enzymes can lead directly to drug treatments that inhibit
    replication. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a method to image important
    structures. The proposed innovation enables fast classification of images and
    creation of 3-dimensional structures by using advanced deep learning techniques.
    \ This will accelerate analysis and discovery by more than 50%. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project delivers an autonomous image
    processing pipeline for Cryo-EM data sets in real time at benchmark accuracies.
    On average, each cryo-EM microscope produces up to 2 TB of data daily. High-resolution
    image sizes from Cryo-EM are typically on the order of 10k x 10k pixels, requiring
    specialized software to process, classify and convert these images into 3D structures.
    Traditional fully supervised deep learning methods fail due to diversity of biomolecules
    and lack of labeled images. The proposed approach utilizes large-scale “deep unsupervised”
    learning methods that can train AI systems and deliver accurate results without
    labeled data on full resolution image sizes by use of High Performance Computing
    (HPC) clusters. The project involves development of cloud infrastructure software
    that eliminates GPU memory limitations. Further, the proposed machine learning
    approach dramatically accelerates and improves cryo-EM particle picking, both
    in 2-D images from single particle reconstruction workflows and in 3-D images
    of intact cells in electron tomography workflows at benchmark accuracies.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial the potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is significant reduction in suffering and healthcare costs from the incidence of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs), Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs), and Superbugs. This project will provide many societal benefits: improved disaster care prior to hospitalization; better in-field military injury outcomes; improved infection care in underdeveloped nations with limited access to hospitals and clinics, and others. Costs of HAIs and SSIs currently exceed $41B worldwide. A recent estimate indicates that failing to tackle antibiotic resistance could lead to over 10M deaths annually, and millions in cumulative economic damage. The proposed technology is an infection treatment that does not use antibiotics.  As an alternative, this project will offer a non-pharmaceutical solution providing cost-effective treatments that reduce the clinical use of antibiotics. This project will provide a reduction in patient suffering, improved medical outcomes, and reduced overall healthcare costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a non-pharmaceutical therapy that selectively kills bacteria and viruses and prevents SSI’s and HAI’s and does not induce further antimicrobial resistance. The project focuses on combining and simultaneous applying specific wavelengths of light and sound frequency resulting in a novel therapeutic dose to kill bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The technology can be used pre-surgery to disinfect body areas where the surgery will be performed, and post-surgery to prevent infections at surgical sites. The innovative combination of specific wavelengths of light and sound frequency activates a unique biochemical mechanism to kill bacteria from within. The research will identify ideal materials that will transmit both light and sound energies efficiently whilst meeting safety, efficacy, and ergonomic configurations for proposed applications. The aim is to also find optimal treatment times to treat different areas of the body for specific bacterial infections.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the COVID-19 global pandemic. Recently,
    transfusions of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients has shown some efficacy
    in treatment. This is due to antibodies in the donor plasma that recognize the
    SARS-CoV-2 virus, boosting the recipient’s immune system to better fight COVID-19.
    By mixing donor plasma with magnetic particles coated with molecules that can

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to improve solid organ transplantation outcomes. Few significant clinical or technological advancements have been made within the last two decades to improve organ matching success, and the accuracies of current models predicting survival outcomes are diminishing. There is a great need for clinicians to have better decision-making support tools. Every 12 minutes, a new person is added to the organ transplant waiting list, a number growing by about five percent each year. Within a single day, 21 people die waiting for a kidney, liver, or other organ match. Although 36,500 kidney and liver transplants are performed each year, the patient demand for donor organs far outweighs supply by four to one, so the need to improve donor-recipient matching is urgent. Optimizing the donor organ-patient match is a key determining factor for improving transplant success and patient survival. This project's artificial intelligence (AI) model will guide transplant surgeons, physicians, and other healthcare professionals will deliver precise, accurate, quantitative information for real-time predictions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes artificial intelligence to predict outcomes after solid organ transplantation procedures. Clinicians currently consider several factors when determining organ allocation and candidate patient ranking on the recipient waitlist, including extent of disease pathology, functional status of the recipient, and intrinsic donor and recipient compatibility factors. Measures, indices and functional status scores have been designed to predict specific outcomes but are not easily combined into one optimized decision to guide organ allocation decisions. To date, no organ-matching predictive outcome model has comprehensively synthesized all available patient- and donor-specific variables at the time of transplantation. This project will train an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to comprehensively integrate all information available at the time of transplantation procedures (hundreds of variables) into a predictive model. An AI model of this nature would be a substantial improvement from linear models able to synthesize only a modest number of parameters (approximately 15) to date. It is expected that the proposed technology will predict both pre- and post-transplant survival more accurately than currently accepted models.

    The broader impact/commerical potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a potentially significant reduction in medication-related falls, injuries, and deaths, as well as a reduction in fall-related medical costs.  The number of older adults dying from falls increased by a factor of three between 2000 and 2016, with increased medication use possibly contributing to this alarming trend.   Polypharmacy (i.e., taking 4 or more drugs) is growing with a 3-fold increase from 1992 to 2002.  Since drugs are a modifiable risk factor, periodic medication reviews are recommended for fall prevention.   This project will explore a new balance test involving target tracking to remotely monitor medication fall risk and allowing for timelier, personalized assessment of the risk of getting hurt.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new balance test using target tracking. Technical work includes: 1) Confirm that the new test is sensitive to medication effects and is safe to perform; 2) Discriminate between fallers and non-fallers, thus demonstrating test validity; and 3) Compare test results with those of other tools.

    during therapy sessions. A prototype will be deployed in a field data collection
    study to determine usability and a provide a rich set of data for algorithm development.
    Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection
    of patient dropout. We will measure several quantities as potential data sets
    for training and testing algorithms.  We will evaluate several models including

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a nearshore (just offshore of inhabited
    coastal land, in shallow water) solution to reduce coastal flooding. The proposed
    project addresses a need to lessen heavy flood protection solutions based on carbon-intensive
    concrete in the form of seawalls and other barriers. This project will prototype
    an interconnected network of floating growth mats, made to seed marsh grass above
    the water and seaweed below. The heavy biomass of these mats and their network
    properties as a large interconnected group provides wave and storm surge reduction.
    A proposed turnkey kit offers a low-cost system, readily deployable and expandable
    over time. Additionally, as a floating park-like marine landscape, it has many
    co-benefits to the surrounding communities. As plant-based infrastructure, it
    serves as a site for native marsh grasses and local seaweeds to populate, providing
    new habitats and improving water quality. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project is a natural
    coastal resilience technology designed to be pre-fabricated, modular, and easy
    to implement for a variety of coastal environments and communities. The technology
    consists of robust vegetated mats linked in a network and deployed in the nearshore.
    The mats are colonized by local varieties of semi-aquatic marsh flora above the
    water line, and aquatic seaweeds below. Research objectives to validate this approach
    include comparing mat network performance in a range of flow conditions, including
    extreme waves, to inform mat design.  A second research thrust will measure biomass
    accumulation and ecological performance through in situ deployments of mat structures.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Phase I project will be to improve product quality in products generated in continuous
    extrusion environments.  For instance, 2-55% of raw material can be wasted in
    plastics extrusion. In aggregate at least $500M raw material is lost each year
    in the US alone, creating additional environmental concerns because this waste
    plastic is typically not reusable nor recyclable. Manual inspection is problematic
    for this process at scale.  This project will apply intelligent systems to automatically

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an new way of imaging the entire chest and lungs, a critical capability in assisting physicians treat COVID-19 patients. Identification of COVID-19 patients with lung conditions enables accurate triage to appropriate care levels. Current imaging modalities are limited:  CT scans are limited by logistics of patient flow, re-sterilization after use, cost, and radiation risk; and conventional ultrasound cannot penetrate the full depth of lung tissue.  The proposed project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside low-cost, non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung, delivered via remote streaming and control, for the complex logistics of COVID-19 patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung parenchyma, mediastinum, and pleura. This project will develop core transducer components for integration into ultrasound probes, creating a 2-D imaging probe using 1-D transducer arrays. These 2-D arrays could ultimately be extended into a 3-D probe with full tomographic capabilities. The project will demonstrate the capability for lung imaging with sufficient quality to distinguish COVID-19 related issues without the need for accurate positioning, alignment, or registration.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help manage COVID-19 transmission in hospitals
    with a novel patient face mask to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus during
    endoscopic procedures.  All endoscopic procedures are considered aerosol-generating
    procedures because of the possibility of coughing and retching during upper endoscopy,
    and the passage of flatus during colonoscopy. The proposed patient endoscopic
    mask limit the spread of microdroplet and aerosols from the patient. This project
    proposes to develop an endoscopy mask which will be disposable, single use, with
    an oral opening for the introduction of an endoscope to the gastrointestinal tract.
    The proposed solution will allow most type of endoscopes, probes, and tubes to
    be inserted through the mask and enter the mouth or nose, while providing a seal
    between the mask and scope to limit leakage during the procedure. In addition,
    it will reduce the post-procedure wait time needed for air circulation in the
    endoscopy room to remove aerosols for the safety of patients and gastrointestinal
    health care givers. The solution will be useful for managing transmissions of

    the mouth of a patient. The proposed mask will have an access for suction to clear
    airway secretions and to remove aerosol and micro-droplets generated during endoscopic
    procedures. If successful, this seal technology can be utilized in other aerosol-generating
    clinical applications, such as reducing spread of aerosolized droplets of blood

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop new touch sensors for applications in many sectors, such as fitness, healthcare and automotive uses.  The proposed system uses special light sources that change internally when pressure is applied to external surfaces. These can be extremely accurate and have previously been used to control robots. The proposed project extends this to human-computer interfaces, with an initial focus on developing novel wearables that track motion for human performance monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on using elastomeric material to create lightguides that change power output upon stretching, expanding the use of these highly accurate photonic strain gauges. This photonics sensor matrix consists of nodes of intersecting powered and unpowered stretchable optical lightguides in 2D and 3D arrays. When these lightguides contact, the light coupled between them is proportional to the applied stress and strain, localizing the deformation and measuring its amplitude. This project will address:  1) scaled production of these fibers; 2) development of centralized electronics hubs ensuring separation from sensing fibers; and 3) development of robust signal processing for calibration and error minimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable superior digital displays with better cost, power, and performance.  Today's typical solutions include liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). LCDs require many layers of materials, each of which adds cost, reduces efficiency, and increases fragility; OLEDs are typically even more expensive to make and degrade faster than LCDs.  This project proposes a manufacturing process for an improved display assembled from arrays of very small light sources.  These displays will enable advances in many applications of low-cost, lightweight displays, such as artificial and virtual reality headsets, automotive consoles, wearables, medical devices, and mobile devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a manufacturing process to place millions of microelectronic components, such as micro-scale light emitting diodes (microLEDs) onto substrates with the required accuracy to build functional displays. Conventional approaches use basic mechanical tooling to pick up each microLED from a source wafer and place it on the target circuit board. The objective of this project is to develop a manufacturing process consistent with yield, cost, and performance requirements.  The project is based on properties of polymers related to those used in photolithography.  When illuminated by light, the polymers vaporize and cause components adhered to them to be transferred to a substrate, moving millions of microLEDs in a single, cost-effective step. This research will advance this technology toward translation.

Lightweight metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, are particularly desirable for alloys used in automotive and aerospace components, as they could reduce the weight of components by 30%-70%. However, it is difficult to coat these materials because the high temperatures required for the coating processes weaken the alloys. This project will develop a new process to conduct the coating process at lower temperatures, offering high load capacity and enhanced wear and corrosion resistance.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes a high-pressure gas nitriding medium to enable surface reactions for coating lightweight metals, allowing for lower treatment temperatures at or below 450C. Traditional engineered surfaces are often incompatible with lightweight metals because of cracking that destroys the functional properties. Furthermore, coating these alloys presents challenges because they distort at relatively low temperatures.  This novel approach of nitriding at high pressures provides a chemically converted surface layer that prepares the surface for a secondary surface treatment, such as diamond-like carbon coatings or metal oxides, that typically fail on lightweight metals. The multi-layer approach also provides enhanced corrosion resistance by disrupting diffusion pathways of corrosive media. Combining a hard and stiff sublayer with a softer top layer with lower elastic modulus provides a multi-layer surface for lightweight metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help fruit and tree nut growers minimize environmental impacts and improve profitability. This project will use data from implantable microchip sensors that directly measure tree hydration to develop precision models of tree and vine needs for water. These models require no hardware installation and are packaged in a user-friendly format. They will automatically provide growers with affordable advice tailored to their field and crop, enabling accurate 24/7 water status data, forecasts, and recommendations for large-scale improvements in irrigation management of tree crops.

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore plant health via continuous variation of water status or drought stress within the tissues. This data stream will be used to build dynamical models of plant water stress. The project's technical aims are to: 1) Characterize the spatial (due to plant position in the field) and temporal variations; 2) Develop a framework for iterative development of predictive models of water stress dynamics from the single-plant to the whole-field scale; and 3) Develop a system optimized for industrial modeling of the spatial and temporal dynamics of water across the full orchard or vineyard, diagnostics of high- and low-performing cultivars, irrigation blocks, and decision support to optimize field design and crop management.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the use of aerogels in daylighting applications to efficiently incorporate natural lighting in building design, benefitting society by significantly decreasing energy consumption and simultaneously improving environments. Natural light is linked to health and productivity The daylighting market ascribes high value to natural light transmission, optical clarity, and thermal insulation; however, existing products generally fail to achieve all three. The proposed technology decouples thermal performance from window clarity, allowing end users to experience the benefits of increased natural light without being resigned to low translucency or high heat or cooling loss. This solution will provide the benefits of natural lighting while improving overall energy efficiency in buildings. As a direct result, architects and glazing contractors will not be limited by thermal considerations when adding windows to structures. Further, it addresses a need for windows that are acoustically insulating.

    The intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project lies in the combination of a proprietary design with a licensed aerogel fabrication method to yield a transformative, elegant window product that promotes natural lighting and reduces energy waste. Silica aerogel monoliths have outstanding insulating ability and superior optical properties to materials currently used in daylighting products; however, traditional methods for making monolithic aerogels are time- and labor-intensive. The patented fabrication method employed in this project is advantageous for several reasons, including ease of automation, speed of processing and production of consistent monolithic aerogels, and offers an alternative to existing daylighting solutions with the potential to transform a generally stagnant industry. To mitigate the risks associated with bringing an aerogel window product to market, this project focuses on: (1) improving aerogel molding technology; (2) developing a proprietary innovation to build larger systems; (3) experimenting with dye-doped and etched aerogels for tailored aesthetic effects; (4) fabricating aerogels for two prototype windows (one colorless, one aesthetically enhanced); (5) developing a simplified window assembly method to fabricate two prototype windows; and (6) studying the aerogel precursor supply chain and use of alternative chemistries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the process of intermittent urinary catheterization while decreasing the risk of associated infection For individuals who cannot empty their bladder due to anatomic or physiologic causes, single-use intermittent catheterization is the safest method for bladder emptying. Despite this, typical catheterization methods produce an annual 40-60% risk of complicated urinary tract infection, leading to over $4 billion of avoidable healthcare costs and patient morbidity. Some catheterization tools are safer than standard disposable catheters (e.g. no-touch catheters), but these are more costly and rarely used. To address this cost, some individuals attempt to sterilize their single-use catheters and reuse them in an off-label manner, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection to 70-80% per year. This project aims to develop a safe reusable catheter with the benefits of a no-touch catheter, allowing for an at-home sterilization device; this innovation will allow for a decrease in urinary tract infection risk, improvement in catheter usability, decreased catheter spending, and a 99% reduction of catheter-associated waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the technical sterilization abilities of this novel purpose-built catheter sterilization device, especially when dealing with anticipated formation of bacterial biofilms. This research will involve exposing catheter samples to pathogen-inoculated urine, performing the anticipated cleaning and sterilization methodologies, and utilizing previously-validated fluorescence imaging techniques to document the presence and location of surviving bacteria and biofilm formation. It is expected that the intended sterilization techniques inherent in this novel device will provide adequate sterilization assurance for safe catheter reuse. This project will also focus on the feasibility of the laboratory-validated cleaning and sterilization protocol for anticipated users to perform without medical supervision. This research will examine cleaning and sterilization protocols by individual catheter users to determine points of potential risk to inform design of the device and the protocol.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable broad use of inorganic micro light emitting diode (microLEDs) in displays through a new manufacturing process.  MicroLEDs are used for ultra-high resolution vivid displays for many consumer electronics applications ranging from hand-held devices to large area displays, but they require low power consumption. The proposed technology will be used to facilitate processes in which the picking and movement of parts that are micron-sized (one-tenth the thickness of a human hair) are advanced through a manufacturing system. It will have the ability to scale to various display form factors and microLED sizes, offering a significant cost advantage and new manufacturing flexibility.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project develops a two-stage process and micro-transfer head (PSETH) technology for the selective massive parallel transfer of microLEDs from native substrate to a display matrix.  The PSETH is enclosed by a film of high magnetic permeability material and is mounted on an electromagnet to hold microsLEDs and features patterned elements of the same size and layout structure as the desired plurality to be transferred. It detaches them from the native substrate using a selective wet etch process, and then picks and transfers only the selected plurality of microLEDs.  The proposed project will advance the technology for use at scale.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from reducing overall COVID-19 mortality,
    and reducing the incidence of morbid secondary infections in intubated patients
    such as ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The market for antifouling/antimicrobial
    indwelling endotracheal tubes (ETTs) was estimated at $1.85 billion in 2017 with
    6.6% annual growth, and further increases are likely due to the outbreaks of COVID-19
    and other respiratory diseases.  More than 50% of COVID-19 deaths are attributable
    to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from secondary healthcare-acquired
    infections, such as VAP. Unfortunately, ETTs used for ventilation do not prevent
    bacterial settlement upon their surfaces (biofouling).  To date there is only
    one FDA-approved antimicrobial ETT that does not target fouling as the root cause
    of VAP, leaving this critical issue unaddressed.  The proposed technology advances
    the development of ETTs with novel coatings and can potentially be used in other
    indwelling biomedical medical devices, including urinary-, central venous-, and
    hemodialysis catheters (estimated market size: $77.7 billion by 2026). A ~10%
    reduction infection rate with this technology could prevent 1.7 million healthcare-acquired
    infections, annually saving 99,000 lives and $28-45 billion associated-cost in
    the US. This technology will also support research in antimicrobial interactions
    with surfaces. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish the feasibility
    of gemini-surfactant inspired coatings on ETTs to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Current
    approaches to prevent biofouling in ETTs involve incorporation of biocidal Ag+
    ions or deposition of hydrophilic polymers resembling traditional surfactants
    to the surface.  However, such biocide-release coatings liberate Ag+ ions that
    are cyto- and genotoxic and are subject to gradual depletion of the active agent.
    \ Meanwhile, the polymers are limited by both intrinsically hydrophobic regions
    in their backbones and the low surface activities of conventional “parent” surfactants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a coupled guidance and control flight software solution that enables multi-spacecraft systems to be truly autonomous in their station-keeping and self-distribution. The proposed innovation is for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to learn how to autonomously determine and command maneuvers that yield a desired spacecraft formation. The proposed project could reduce customers’ cost of operations by removing humans from the closed loop control system. The proposed innovation scales to systems of large numbers of spacecraft without scaling the cost of flight operations. Other potential benefits to customers are risk reductions: a DRL agent does not require an exact model of spacecraft subsystems and orbital dynamics and can learn in real-time, thus being robust to off-nominal system performance and unexpected perturbations. Benefits of this project may include a DRL agent discovering novel guidance and control solutions for mission designs that are not known from legacy orbital dynamics approaches. Potential broader societal impacts include enabling Deep Space Gateway operations and science missions to sample in-situ, simultaneous measurements over a large area, resulting in valuable science data returns for research or commercial applications in Earth orbit or deep space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of implementing DRL as a solution for truly autonomous spacecraft guidance and control. The challenge motivating this project is the control of multi-spacecraft systems, where maneuver planning is neither intuitive nor straightforward due to the nonlinear equations of relative motion. Historically, solutions are found by making simplifying assumptions of circular orbits and linearized equations of relative motion. Such assumptions are avoided in this research plan. The primary research objective is to train a DRL agent using the high-fidelity model of NASA’s General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). First, the problem of achieving a particular formation or distribution will be formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Next, software infrastructure will be developed using TensorFlow, Python, and GMAT. Within this framework, the DRL agent will be trained to learn a policy that maneuvers the spacecraft into a specified formation, subject to operations constraints like available propellant and actuation limits. Anticipated technical results include comparisons of on-policy versus off-policy approaches to achieving coordinated spacecraft mission, demonstration of the technical feasibility of DRL-based flight software for guidance and control, and a characterization of the limitations of DRL-based control.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes the potential to improve survival and quality of life outcomes in cancer care while decreasing treatment costs.  Each year, 1.7 million people in the US are diagnosed with cancer.  National expenditures on cancer care are projected to reach $156 billion by 2020.  Cancer treatment is delivered mostly in an outpatient setting, leaving patients unmonitored at home while at high risk of complications that can lead to high utilization of emergency services and associated hospitalizations.  Early detection of complications can trigger rapid intervention when most effective, leading to improved outcomes and lower costs.  A linked implantable vascular access port will provide sterile means of cancer drug delivery and physiologic monitoring.  Advanced analytics will identify patients showing the earliest signs of common complications.  Finally, aggregated data will provide valuable insights for hospitals to better understand outcomes and costs, serving as a valuable research tool for industry and academic researchers developing next-generation cancer therapies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance technology development toward a linked implantable vascular access port (VAP) capable of intravenous drug delivery and patient monitoring.  The proposed research will focus on risk in technology development and clinically important endpoints.  For ease of use, the linked implantable VAP will communicate with the patient’s mobile device via secure Bluetooth wireless.  Aim #1 focuses on establishing a front-end mobile application to control the collection and transport of ‎multiple sensor inputs and associated metadata.  This mobile application will provide a critical link between the implanted sensor technology and the cloud database for analytics.  As an implantable medical device, replacing the power supply would carry unacceptable risks and costs.  Therefore, Aim #2 focuses on power supply characterization, selection, and optimization.  In Aim #2 power requirements for 12 months of active patient monitoring will be identified based on clinical needs and used to identify a power supply compatible with implantation.  Most cancer patients require radiation therapy as part of their treatment.  It is therefore critical to understand the effect of ionizing radiation on any device implanted in cancer patients.  Aim #3 addresses this need through in vitro irradiation of the device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is technology that encompasses the development of customizable carbon fiber products and package formats at a low cost. Lack of suitable raw materials and corresponding processes has largely stymied the development and manufacturing of many high-volume industrial composite applications. The current advanced material reinforcement knowledge base is built on technology developed to serve space/aerospace composite material applications, which are relatively low-volume and cost-insensitive markets. This project focuses on creating a new platform designed specifically for high-volume, cost-sensitive industrial composite applications. The resulting carbon fiber products from this advanced material delivery platform can be tailored to facilitate a broad range of industrial composite applications currently unmet or underserved, such as automotive, wind energy and infrastructure applications.  This will potentially enable sizable performance and efficiency gains in those industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new carbon fiber format technology platform. The proposed technology platform entails delivering carbon fiber with customizable tow linear densities produced from a universal conversion feedstock while seeking to maintain requisite and optimal physical properties of the carbon fiber. Physical properties of multi-level samples will be analyzed iteratively to determine acceptable linear density boundaries. Prototype mechanical devices will be developed to explore multiple viable approaches to optimize processes for the target product formats. The project also will determine the material handling viability of the resulting products for downstream composite uses. The project will explore the trade space of carbon fiber production economics, application requirements, and product performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance diagnosis and treatment of walking disorders and associated rehabilitation. An estimated 50 million Americans experience gait (walking) impairment due to injury, disease, and age, and more than 38,800 physical therapy clinics treat these patients. This project will develop an artificial intelligence system to extract gait metrics from video data from cameras surrounding a small area. A new diagnostic tool will track nuanced gait metrics throughout rehabilitation treatment. This technology will enable new and faster ways for physical therapists to precisely diagnose gait abnormalities and track treatment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project could result in a system to diagnose gait deficiencies for people who suffer from neurological impairments. The proposed project will develop a markerless three-dimensional motion capture system to accurately diagnose gait pathologies in a time- and cost-efficient manner for clinicians. The project will: validate of the markerless motion capture system to ensure accurate measurement of raw kinematic metrics within 10% error of standard methods and potentially expand the system metrics; and conduct verification and validation processes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an engineered probiotic as an treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. Acute gout episodes cause debilitating pain and hypersensitivity, seriously impairing mobility. Over time, joint damage and deformity, chronic usage-related pain, and disfigurement follow. Although gout can be treated by drugs that lower uric acid levels, these drugs have significant drawbacks for many patients: they have limited effectiveness, are associated with serious side effects, and may be expensive. Gout patients experience an estimated increase of 5 absence days annually with an incremental cost of $3,000 per patient. The 9.2 million gout patients in the USA spend more than $1.3 billion per year on gout drugs. Moreover, roughly half take additional supplements. The proposed project will develop a novel probiotic strain to address hyperuricemia.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance hyperuricemia treatment using an engineered probiotic. The proposed treatment is based on the observation that enzymatically degrading uric acid in the intestine reduces serum uric acid levels, unlike conventional treatments targeting the circulatory system, the urinary tract, or function systemically. This project will use genetic screening to identify a probiotic strain to break down uric acid, engineering it to prevent gene mobility across species and avoid transfer of antibiotic resistance to the intestinal microbiome. Finally, we will confirm safety and efficacy in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from development of augmented intelligence software improving planning and operational decisions for water and wastewater systems. The most challenging issues for water utilities include addressing aging infrastructure, adapting complex systems to changing regulations, and addressing the impacts of environmental change. They arise from interconnected infrastructure networks that interface with both the built and natural environment. Current artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions for water are narrowly defined for specific use cases. The proposed intelligence software will enable transformative changes in water management by seamless composition of hybrid models from simulators and data-driven models to overcome data and information silos, enabling decision-makers to integrate data in a system model that increases resilience at reduced customer costs. These improvements can lead to significant reductions in the roughly $4.7 B annual energy spend for water/wastewater, $50 B in combined sewer system programs, and up to $1 T in aging infrastructure needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop methods for combining multi-fidelity simulation models and data-driven models to support decision-making for both long-term planning needs and real-time operational decision support for water and wastewater systems. Meta-modeling techniques for embedding physical system understanding from high-fidelity physics-based simulators to low-fidelity models will be evaluated. Accuracy and runtime tradeoffs will be evaluated for multiple reduced-order methods (e.g. linear and non-linear equations, projection-based methods) to enable more efficient optimization of large solution spaces. Domain applications include reduced-order versions of the St Venant equations for one-dimensional flow, and analytical solutions of biological, physical, and chemical processes in secondary wastewater treatment.  The project will evaluate multiple machine learning methods, including deep neural networks, reinforcement learning, random forest, support vector machines, and boosted learning algorithms, to detect patterns in observed data for near-term predictive power toward operational real-time decisions. Expert elicitation techniques will be used to quantify human expertise for subjective decision criteria, integrating valuable tacit human knowledge into the decision process. Meta-analysis of alternative hybrid modeling workflows will be evaluated to identify computationally efficient pathways to optimize complex planning challenges.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve productivity, compliance and insight for businesses. Documents are the underlying fabric of business as they hold detailed agreements, obligations, requirements and terms central to business operations with customers, suppliers, partners and regulators. However, documents still represent "dark data", separate and inaccessible to automated business processes. Businesses like commercial real estate, insurance, professional services, financial services, legal firms and many others produce and consume many documents containing similar patterns with innumerable variations. Authoring and executing these agreements is laborious and error-prone, but it is difficult to automate the use of this semi-structured information. This project develops a series of sophisticated steps to discern structure and information from narrative text, applying the latest techniques from several schools of thought in artificial intelligence. This project will enable knowledge workers to gain the assistance of artificial intelligence to author and execute commercial agreements with greater ease, efficiency, precision, confidentiality, compliance and insight.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance unstructured human-centered text with a structured computer-optimized version, a "shadow" representation of each document that uses XML and database technology to enable innovative software assistance for users and organizations. The research takes a multi-faceted approach, applying computer vision and then creating a pipeline of new algorithms using techniques from Deep Learning, Bayesian, Evolutionary, Symbolic and Classic NLP.  The process operates on "small" datasets (10-30 documents) with high accuracy as well as large datasets.

    Phase I project is to advance the capability of current robots to autonomously
    engage with the household environment, recognize objects, and manipulate them

    of household and entertainment robots. A user can teach a robot a wide range of

    leverages a deep neural network-based computer vision system that creates a lower-dimensional
    representation of the world-view of the robot. On this latent encoding, the robot
    behavior is trained using a combination of optimization criteria (e.g. training
    loss) that ensures the generalization of the target task, smooth operation, recovery
    from accidental mistakes, and ability to choose between alternative solutions
    to the problem (e.g. avoid an obstacle to the left or to the right). The technology
    is novel: current learning by demonstration systems usually reproduce an identical
    trajectory to what has been demonstrated. This might be useful on a factory floor
    but would not work in a home environment. In contrast, the proposed model learns

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a smart wearable stethoscope platform as a new tool to remotely monitor patients affected by COVID-19. Many infected patients may not present with symptoms until it is too late. Remotely monitoring these patients for the development of cough and shortness of breath prior to presentation in respiratory distress is critical. Patients with existing cardiopulmonary disease are at increased risk of contracting viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia due to COVID-19, but it is challenging to continuously assess these patients’ lung sounds due to risks of healthcare worker exposure. There is a clear need for more effective ways to monitor patients’ respiratory health due to COVID-19 both in quarantined patients and those in acute care. This project allows for remote monitoring to help triage COVID-19 patients and reduce healthcare worker exposure.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the further development and optimization of an artificial intelligence-based wearable device that monitors and analyzes lung sounds in high ambient noise environments. Ambient noise affects the use of standard electronic stethoscopes. Many commercially available electronic stethoscopes address ambient noise by reducing dynamic range or by warning the user not to use the device in a high noise environment. These mitigation methods restrict the utility of these devices by limiting the information that can be obtained from the acoustic measurements. Additionally, susceptibility to ambient noise eliminates its potential use in the home environment. Ambient noise has been shown to degrade the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms trained in low-noise environments to accurately detect lung sounds. This project addresses issues with high ambient noise using novel and established techniques of passive noise cancellation, active noise cancellation, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The optimal combination and integration of these solutions in a wearable respiratory monitoring platform will establish a useful tool for use in a variety of real-world environments. The success of this project will be measured by the improvement of the machine learning sensitivity metrics after system optimization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the potential to reduce devastation from forest fires.  Wildfires across the world increasingly cause devastating impacts on local economies, human life, air quality, natural resources, property value, jobs and wages.  In 2018, more than 58 million wildfires burned 8.8 million acres in the U.S.  A system that alerts authorities within minutes (vs. days) dramatically increases the ability to minimize property damage and loss of life.  The goal of this project is to develop a precise computationally efficient AI-based software solution for thermal (infrared) imaging detection of fire, to be implemented on various remote and moving platforms, such as manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.  The resulting technology will be more precise than current solutions due to the incorporation of a unique approach to machine learning based on the use of real-life and artificially created training datasets.  In addition, it will be developed to function “at the edge” to enable local, real-time operations in remote locations.  A Deep Convolutional Learning approach should dramatically improve current mathematical models, potentially saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate how a solution utilizing Deep Convolutional Learning can be successfully applied to the detection of forest fires from moving or static platforms or in remote locations.  The project takes a unique approach to image recognition using multiplication-free neural networks based only on the discriminator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and training the model with real and artificially created datasets that address extensive variability of conditions.  This will eliminate confusion in the detection of smoke plumes, which can be caused by clouds and reflections of bodies of water.   Additionally, the development of low-power neural network algorithms for real-time processing of sensory data will enable the software to run on low-cost embedded computers for use in remote, resource-constrained environments.  Expectations are for precision levels above 80%, false alarm rates at less than 1 per 24 hours, time to detection in minutes vs. days and ease of use in the most remote locations.

    This broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is to address certain medical procedures, such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Currently, one in 11 people develop kidney stones by the age of 70, with a lifetime recurrence rate of 60-80%. PCNL, which involves removal of kidney stones through a surgical channel into the kidney, is the preferred method for stones less than 2 cm. However, availability of this critical procedure is limited by technical difficulty and cost. Current dilation systems are (1) cumbersome, requiring two skilled users, (2) not optimized for ultrasound visibility, limiting use of this less expensive, radiation-free imaging modality, (3) damaging to the kidney, and (4) only allow pre-selected tract diameter, inhibiting miniaturized access adoption. The product developed in this proposal will reduce the time, cost, and negative side effects of PCNL by providing one-step dilation with combined dilator, balloon, and sheath; offering several operating diameters with the same sheath; and providing ultrasound visibility. This technology can help hospitals recoup up to 20% of direct costs per procedure by facilitating the transition to ultrasound-based dilation and more miniaturized access. The less invasive nature of this dilator can potentially avoid expensive complications and convert the requirement for a hospital stay into an out-patient procedure.

    The proposed STTR Phase I project will address achieving ultrasound visibility, as a device made of a thin polymer is typically hard to detect on ultrasound. To optimize the dilator for ultrasound visibility, the effects of parameters such as geometric changes, surface texture, material, echogenic coatings, and reagents on ultrasound visibility must be assessed, with a focus on delineating the tip of the sheath for maximal precision and safety. The material also needs to 1) maintain columnar stiffness for penetration into tissue, 2) resist radial compression when in the expanded and locked position, 3) be flexible and thin enough to roll tightly around a balloon dilator, 4) be lubricious to allow sliding expansion to occur smoothly and 5) be durable enough to withstand post processing and sterilization. This project will advance the development of a sheath and tip to be adapted for extrusion manufacturing and integrated with current balloon dilators. Verification and validation studies will be conducted to demonstrate the improvement in visibility, procedure speed and ease of use, and quantitative material testing will be conducted. Mechanical evaluation will include: radial compression, tensile strength, sheath fatigue from torque, durability, and performance following aging. Through this program, the product will demonstrate the theoretical and practical capabilities of using thin plastic devices for ultrasound guided procedures.

    Phase I project will result from improving the quality of healthcare and streamlining
    its delivery. The accumulation of clinical data has become a potentially valuable
    resource for clinical practice, as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) contain information
    on day-to-day patient care. Latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
    applied to EMR data enable the development of health Intelligent Virtual Assistants
    (hIVAs) to assist healthcare professionals in incorporating evidence-based decision
    support, reducing errors and improving efficiency. Current most promising NLP
    approaches are underdeveloped for the clinical domain given the lack of high-quality
    annotated clinical data required for training, testing and validating the machine
    learning algorithms. As most EMR data is available as unstructured free text,
    software developers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) struggle to find these annotated
    texts. The proposed project will inform the production of high-quality hIVAs -
    from voice-based clinical AI chatbots for assisting physicians at the point of
    care to Question-Answering systems for clinical decision-making. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge
    of exploiting different combinations of Deep Learning (DL) structures for developing
    a novel set of annotation tools and an expert adjudication methodology to optimize
    the development of annotated corpora, specifically tailored for the clinical domain.
    The lack of these standard and annotated data sets is a major bottleneck preventing
    progress in clinical Information Extraction. Without these corpora, individual
    Natural Language Processing applications abound without the ability to train different
    algorithms, share and integrate modules, or compare performance. The company is
    leveraging the latest DL techniques to develop a unique architecture, able to
    identify a comprehensive set of context modifiers within unstructured clinical
    texts. This approach will boost the semi-automatic annotation of clinical corpora;
    produce accurate and robust annotated corpora; and reduce corpora production time
    and cost. The project objectives include: (1) adapting the existing in-house algorithm
    for automatic clinical text pre-annotation; (2) integrating a hybrid algorithm
    into a multi-user operable software platform for obtaining a minimum viable semi-automatic
    annotation product; (3) conducting a small pilot study to validate the performance
    of the resulting software platform and a Minimum Viable Product of an annotated

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to address age-related cognitive impairments. Neurodegenerative disorders are a rapidly growing public-health concern, with Alzheimer’s disease alone projected to affect 13.8 million Americans by 2050. Alzheimer’s disease patients undergo gradual cognitive decline and during this progression, patients experience multiple pain points, including memory loss, executive function deficits, and depression. Early intervention in the mild impairment stage may assist in delaying cognitive decline. While pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer’s disease have primarily targeted biological markers such as amyloid-Beta plaques, these strategies have shown limited success in improving outcomes. The proposed device consists of a novel therapy for cognitive impairment conditions through a device that stimulates the brain via music and lights.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result in a digital-health device that non-invasively drives Gamma-frequency neural activity in the brain to improve memory and cognition in aging individuals suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. The digital-health device is based on neural network technology that models the dynamics of rhythmic brain activity. In clinical populations who have disruptions in brain rhythms, i.e., patients with Alzheimer’s disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment, we hypothesize that these technologies can help restore normal brain activity important for memory and cognition. This project will: 1) optimize the technology by integrating multiple Gamma-frequency parameters into a flexible neural network model for musical beat detection, and 2) determine how the device impacts neural activity and cognitive abilities in aging adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing surgery.  Inadvertent bleeding during surgery represents a critical problem that occurs during all types of procedures on millions of patients around the world.  This project will advance a robotic surgical tool system using artificial intelligence (AI) to manage intraoperative bleeding.  Reduced blood loss will lead to a reduced demand for blood transfusions, reduced healthcare costs, and improved recuperation from surgery.   This technology will advance a universal standard for bolt-on safety utilities to the evolving surgical tool manufacturer market.

    The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will advance the translation of an intelligent intraoperative system.  Currently, there is no tool to detect or characterize bleeding, so the surgeon must continually monitor the camera view for bleeding and estimate the source of the bleed, which is often submerged in a pool of blood.  The proposed effort will advance a prototype to assist a surgeon in detecting, visualizing, and characterizing arterial bleeding in real time during urological surgery. The source of the bleeding will be presented to the surgeon using 2D or 3D (augmented reality) overlays, enabling him/her to control the bleeding precisely and quickly.  The technology fuses robotics, computer vision, and machine learning in a novel manner to produce a surgical tool that will significantly advance the current state-of-the-art.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the acceleration and improvement of battery manufacturing and production. Forecasting battery safety and lifetime is largely an unsolved problem in the battery industry. For manufacturers, this uncertainty increases cell cost through control measures during production as well as the precautions taken to avoid warranty events. This project proposes "data science-as-a-service" for battery formation to address both issues. By streamlining the battery formation, test, and grading process, manufacturers benefit from reduced work-in-progress (WIP) inventory waiting for final inspection, reducing facility space requirement to store WIP cell, and reducing scrap rates and increasing manufacturing yields.  The impact of these improvements will potentially enable wider spread adoption of electric vehicle applications, a major driver for battery demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing information technology infrastructure and algorithms for the prediction of battery performance during cell production. By combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with data management and manufacturing execution systems, battery cell manufacturers will greatly reduce the cost to operate and manage cell formation and test - an environment which has been largely underserved for innovation. The proposed project objectives will be achieved through two developing battery classification and prediction machine learning algorithms to improve early detection of battery failures.  Novel implementation of the proof-of-concept algorithms in battery production environments will improve the key performance indicators of these battery manufacturers.  Regression and clustering models will be used as often as possible, and the bulk of the technical work will be dedicated to the feature engineering required to elucidate changes in the change and discharge voltage profile during the first few cycles. New features will be developed by a) modelling physical processes (e.g. growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer) expected for a given cluster group or b) employing dynamical systems techniques like time-delay embeddings.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to effectively treat skin tears, which when mismanaged, have a high propensity to become complex and chronic wounds involving infection, pain and delayed wound healing and impose health and financial burdens on individuals and care agencies. Skin tear injury effects at least 1.9 million institutionalized patients yearly and has a high probability to reoccur in high-risk categories, elderly and neonates.  Though frequently under-reported, the literature suggests skin tears have a prevalence that is similar to pressure injuries. In USA long term care settings, the prevalence rate is 20% with skin tears principally on arms (60%) and legs (40%) occurring during daily routines. This research is to provide a skin tear treatment that requires less nursing time, reduces pain, and improves healing times resulting in improved patient quality of life and treatment cost savings.  The estimated USA market for skin tear treatment is $646 million/year with 44% ($285 million/year) coming from nursing homes, wound care clinics and home health. The innovative chemistry developed through this research could be applied to other medical devices, separation membranes, and coatings/films to provide mechanical strength, anti-fouling, or size exclusion separation.

    The proposed project is to investigate the premise that zwitterion-containing polymers can be created that retain epidermal-like membrane properties for wound healing and demonstrate mechanical strength when evaporated as thin films (e.g., Saran™ wrap-like).  Each of these intellectually challenging goals is a technical hurdle to be addressed by the proposed R&D. The research findings are to direct the research for and subsequent development of a skin tear treatment product.  The Phase I research focus is to synthesize and characterize this unique class of film-forming copolymers that contain zwitterions - with specific objectives to synthesize zwitterionic polymers, characterize polymers, determine mechanical properties and correlate morphology to mechanical properties. This research is to provide vital feasibility data for polymer synthesis, masking of zwitterion self-assembly, and zwitterion self-assembly parameters during solvent evaporation to form a strong polymer film. The resulting platform chemistry and body of knowledge is anticipated to be translated into a wound care product for skin tear treatment.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be the development of an artificial intelligence software solution that enables automated detection of dental cavities in digital X-rays. Routine misdiagnosis of dental cavities (tooth decay) is a global challenge; cavities alone account for over 5% of healthcare costs in developed countries, with dental care focused on repairing rather than preventing tooth decay. This project will develop an add-on solution for software already in use by 200,000 dentists nationally. The technology resulting from this project will allow non-expert assistants to automate the triaging, screening, and tracking of patients, increasing access to oral care for underserved communities nationally and throughout the world.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of two key innovations: (1) a novel software framework using an innovative neural network algorithm for the detection of cavities in X-rays, and (2) the world’s largest database of dental radiographs annotated by specialists in oral radiology. The goals of R&D are to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in cavity detection and to ensure consistent high-quality annotations. Outcomes include: (1) achieving state-of-the-art performance in cavity detection, (2) outperforming domain experts in detecting all stages of cavities, and (3) enabling professionals and non-experts alike to interpret pathologies using a visual heatmap of prediction confidence. The proposed technology features an innovative neural network structure for learning visual representations of dental radiographs that jointly characterize the data while highlighting their most salient attributes. Using a new and original training procedure, the technology will maximize the benefit of existing unlabeled data. Technical challenges include scaling performance while maintaining a minimal false-negative rate, establishing interoperability under various calibration settings, and achieving the desired level of results on the types of machines used by customers with reasonable resource costs.

    Phase I project will result from targeting pain points in the K-16 math and physical
    science curriculum to improve participation and sustained achievement in these
    subjects. Despite investments in education technology, curriculum overhaul, and
    teacher development, STEM education in the US continues to struggle to improve
    student proficiency, democratize access, and meet global changes in workforce
    demand. Current methodologies continue to promote 2D tools to teach concepts that
    are inherently 3D in nature, which have led to gaps in spatial reasoning and the
    ability to conceptualize abstractions - critical skills for success in STEM. The
    company seeks to develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) platform that closes
    these gaps in STEM proficiency, particularly for non-selective and historically
    underserved student populations. The aim is to shape the next generation of STEM
    practitioners by providing students the opportunity to creatively solve high impact
    real world problems in state-of-the-art interactive virtual learning environments.
    Ultimately, it is hoped the proposed platform will become the standard in advanced
    STEM learning solutions, utilizing multiple platforms (VR, AR, Mobile) and data
    analytics to ensure students of all backgrounds are equipped to succeed in STEM
    fields. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
    address a key question for VR in education today - how can VR be used for the
    purpose of cognitive advancement in competencies and skills that serve as gate-keepers
    to success in postsecondary STEM? There is evidence that learning via VR increases
    activity, brain arousal, and engagement, but more lasting impacts on conceptual
    understanding and transfer have yet to be realized. The primary objective of this
    project is to define how core VR functionalities and multimodal interactions can
    be designed and implemented within a rich, problem-driven pedagogical framework
    to enable 3D sense making of abstract topics.  The company will conduct rigorous
    research and iterative user testing to identify the most effective VR modalities
    and kinesthetic interactions that support enduring content mastery and cognitive
    flexibility. In addition, data analytics will be developed to enhance interactivity,
    provide crucial real-time formative assessment of student progress, and predictive
    learning insights to teachers and parents. The technology will also enable networked
    interactions on the platform to promote collaborative learning.  In doing so,
    the project will not only transform the STEM learning experience, but also provide
    a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualized through VR
    to drive student learning outcomes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance technologies for vision improvement. Many suffer from undetected problems with moving their eyes for reading, and current technologies do not reveal this in school screenings or sometimes, even in doctor's offices. This product will be an app designed for smartphones to engage children in games that build skills for optimally using the two eyes together, a critical element in reading ability and visual performance. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by integrating in one app eye movement, psychophysical, and reading fluency assessment. The technical result will be an all-in-one, portable, easy and fun-to-use solution for improving visual skills and reading in children. It will provide data to learning technologists to improve solutions customized to address conditions, such as dyslexia and autism.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the issue of “functional binocular vision” or FBV. When the eyes do not look at exactly the same place, or when they cannot move across a page of text accurately and efficiently, discomfort often occurs. This discomfort causes children in particular to stop reading, affecting their learning. The project aims to develop and test an approach less expensive and more appealing than solutions available today. The proposed app will test existing visual skills (convergence and tracking) and reading fluency, then track the eyes as they move while the user plays games. Users receive points for being able to identify targets; they can only perceive the targets if their eyes are working together correctly. The technology will enable users to get immediate feedback on how they performed in the games (their visual skill level) and how their reading speed (fluency) improves.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a fully flexible high-temperature (operating in the 200-400°C range) insulation product for industrial applications (e.g. pipes and other process systems).  The proposed technology offers performance improvements compared to current solutions, such as fiberglass and mineral wool, while reducing costs through lower-cost manufacturing  and easier installation.  High-temperature industrial insulation can achieve significantly greater energy savings versus building insulation, leading to project paybacks as low as 1-2 years.  This will reduce costs and energy loads in energy-intensive industries such as food, paper, chemicals, refining and metals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize nanomaterials to produce a novel composite insulation material that is flexible and delivers high performance above 200°C.  The inorganic materials will raise temperature durability while high-temperature specialty polymers will enable flexibility.  The materials will be processed using high-volume chemical foaming processes (such as extrusion) scalable into mass production using off-the-shelf equipment, addressing cost and throughput issues.  This work addresses a longstanding industry challenge to mass-produce a fully flexible high-temperature insulation material easily installable by a single individual using standard tools and supplies.  A key activity is to reduce pore sizes below the mean free path of air (~100 nm).  This minimizes all three forms of heat transfer - conduction, convection and radiation, the last of which becomes more prominent at high temperatures.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a highly integrated power-efficient micro-actuator technology.  All electrically powered systems with mechanical moving parts utilize actuators to convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, including robots, surgical/medical micro-devices, precision micro/nano-positioning systems, and optical systems like the Compact Camera Modules (CCM) in smartphones and tablets.  The market for electromechanical actuators embedded in compact camera modules was an estimated $2+ B in 2018.  The proposed project will advance a technology for these CCM optical systems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project aims to explore commercialization of arrayed cell electrostatic (ACE) actuators.  Arrangement of individual micro-scale actuator cells, resembling that of biological muscle cells, allows addition of force and displacements of a large number of cells, leading to large actuator displacements of hundreds of microns.  Submicron electrostatic transduction airgaps within the actuator cells between electrodes tens of microns tall are realized via a bulk micromachining fabrication process utilizing a sacrificial layer technique.  Submicron transduction gaps lead to large work output per actuator volume and lower operating voltage, both of which are major limiting factors for electrostatic actuators.  This project specifically focuses on micro-lens manipulators to replace conventional Voice Coil Motors (VCM) in compact camera modules for Auto-Focus (AF) and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) functions.  The targeted actuators can lead to more compact CCMs with improved auto-focus and image stabilization performance, lower power consumption, and without the VCM heat deteriorating the image sensor performance. The technical efforts will focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of a chip-scale low-power 5-degree of freedom (DOF) micro-lens manipulator suitable for use in compact camera modules.  Comprehensive long-term reliability and durability tests will be performed on the fabricated prototypes to determine the limitations and viability of the actuators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of novel wearable sensor techniques to provide a complete diagnostic assessment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with a single wireless patch worn on the chest. An estimated 25-30 M adults in the United States have OSA, but 80% of OSA-positive patients are undiagnosed while the highest volume clinics can only conduct around 5,000 sleep tests annually. Low diagnosis rates result partly from the challenge of sleep clinics managing an inventory of expensive and complex home sleep testing devices. To date, all home sleep tests require patients to wear bulky sensors that attach to multiple (3-5) regions of their body via a network of wires, tubes, and probes. This project will explore novel, unobtrusive, cost-effective sensors to reliably detect apnea and hypopnea during sleep. The project outcomes will strengthen fundamental understanding of how physiological signals are altered during sleep apnea and how to reliably measure these signals using simple wearable patches.

    The proposed SBR Phase I project will advance the development of a sensor platform for a wireless device to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea. The project will explore the feasibility of new sensing modalities to provide sufficient diagnostic information with a single wireless patch. The innovation stems from: (1) use of novel cardiorespiratory sensing modalities and machine learning to determine respiratory events and arousals from disordered breathing, and (2) integration of multiple sensing modalities into a chest-worn patch to provide a complete assessment of sleep apnea severity according to established clinical guidelines. This project will: conduct functional tests of sensor modalities relative to the clinical standard wired technologies; identify digital signatures of disordered breathing using advanced digital signal processing techniques; and assess the diagnostic capability of the complete single patch sensor relative to the clinical gold standard sleep tests.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in transforming a source of water pollution into a renewable source of fertilizer, which will reduce dependence on non-renewable resources for both wastewater treatment and fertilizer production. Rather than combining all domestic wastewater into one dilute stream, this project inverts the paradigm by separating out and recycling the largest source of nutrient pollution: urine. Special toilets with a separate drain at the front of the bowl direct urine through dedicated plumbing to a compact building-scale processor, which converts it into a purified liquid fertilizer. This technology will have immediate utility in sensitive watersheds where regulations require landowners to remove nitrogen from wastewater using expensive septic systems upgrades. Urine diversion could be an alternative to such upgrades, at a lower cost, with less ongoing energy demand, and with the added benefit of producing fertilizer as an end product. When the technology is more mature, it could be applied in areas served by central sewers, as a decentralized nutrient recovery strategy. The technology will create jobs in installation and service, reduce the load on wastewater treatment plants, help restore our waterways, and yield a clean, domestically-produced fertilizer for use in agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance translation of a building-scale urine collection and treatment system is paired with commercially-available urine-diverting toilet fixtures to create an advanced resource recovery system with a conventional bathroom experience. The system employs a four-step process: acidification, pasteurization, freeze concentration, and charcoal filtration. The combined effect of these four steps includes volume reduction, odor control, nutrient stabilization, and removal of contaminants such as pathogens and pharmaceutical residues. The project has two main goals: 1) measuring the energy requirements of the treatment steps, using these data to optimize the freeze concentration step; and 2) testing the performance during ongoing operation to identify and address problems relating to biofilm or mineral scale formation. The proposed freeze concentrator uses a proprietary technology that is mechanically simple, energy-efficient, and scalable to a small physical footprint. In addition to urine diversion, this device could have useful applications in other fields requiring a small, mechanically simple, and inexpensive dewatering system. The four processing subsystems will be designed using thermal and hydraulic modeling, and tested using real urine from a source-separating toilet. Subsystems will be tested individually for performance and energy efficiency, and then together as an integrated system.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to develop an antiviral surface coating with unique application
    and efficacy features.  Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus strain can remain
    live on stainless steel and plastic for as long as three days, a potentially harmful
    situation in environments with high traffic, such as subway turnstiles, buses,
    and high-touch surfaces in hospitals.  Furthermore, even in hospitals, cleaning
    and disinfecting can be insufficiently comprehensive than desired, with surfaces
    that may easily be recontaminated until disinfectants are reapplied. The proposed
    technology enables chlorine-based disinfectants to be effective for as long as
    4 weeks. The coating keeps chlorine in a physical and chemical state that is active
    against viruses, but remains safe and does not cause skin irritation upon contact.
    The coating can turn any surface into an antimicrobial, and antiviral, surface.
    \n\nThe proposed SBIR Phase I project will assess the utility, efficacy and safety
    of a spray-on surface coating that is rechargeable and can be reapplied, such
    that it can be used as an antimicrobial surface coating, particularly to prevent
    transmission of coronaviruses. The state-of-the-art is to regularly use liquid
    spray disinfectants to kill viruses on surfaces. However, typical active ingredients,
    such as chlorine, quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohol, peracetic acid or hydrogen
    peroxide, are active against viruses for a matter of minutes and certainly less
    than an hour, leaving a surface that can potentially be recontaminated.  The technical
    aims of the proposal focus on 1) assessing the virucidal activities of the coating
    at specific times after application; 2) determining the half-life of coronaviruses
    on the coating for comparison to other materials.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a new wearable device, worn in the mouth like a dental retainer, mouthguard, or piercing. It will enable new interactions in  Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/XR), but also serve as an assistive device to the 63 million people suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), and physical injuries blocking people from using computers effectively. This will establish new markets for this type of wearable interface; unlock new human-machine interactions, both as a standalone device and paired with Head Mounted Display (HMD) systems; and expand new interfaces that are private, hands-free, heads-up, and taking better advantage of natural human intraoral/mental abilities. This will have significant impact for SCI/CTS users who will obtain the ability to use computers, as well as the large and emerging AR/VR/XR industries using HMDs hands-free/heads-up with private gestural interaction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the translation of a novel interface tool for the human mouth and tongue via an intraoral wearable solution.  It will exploit the fact that the largest dedicated areas of the brain’s sensory cortex and motor cortex are for hand, mouth, and tongue function. This interface adapts these already strong human oral abilities, connecting them to the digital world. This project will create a device to be worn like a dental retainer, where the device creates a haptic user interface with haptic patterns among which the user can feel and move, analogous to a touch screen navigated by tapping and swiping through visual icons and menus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make infrared (IR) thermal imaging more affordable and widespread.  Thermal imaging is used for firefighting, warfighter night vision, mechanical monitoring, and automotive safety, in particular. The majority of pedestrian fatalities could potentially be prevented by automotive night vision cameras; however, current infrared lenses are cost-prohibitive, limiting their adoption.  The proposed project will advance the development of a transparent IR material that can lower imaging costs.  Benefits will include lighter night vision goggles in defense applications, greater deployment of thermal imaging in automotive markets, and more accurate machine monitoring for industrial applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new class of chalcogenide optical polymers for infrared imaging applications.  Most mass-produced lenses, such as those in smartphones, are made of polymers that are transparent in the visible but opaque in the IR.  The proposed sulfur-based polymer is based on new chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering.  The proposed project will address the trade space defined by infrared transparency, encouraging higher chalcogen content; and thermomechanical stability and processability, encouraging higher organic content.  In addition, the material's plastic nature enables novel optical designs that could potentially employ state-of-the-art freeform concepts currently rarely used in infrared imaging.  Such designs can lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for a range of infrared imaging applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of detection systems for autonomous vehicles. The proposed technology takes advantage of trends in price, performance, and quality of imagers and processors driven by the proliferation of these devices in smartphones. The technologyalso provides key capabilities such as integrated color information, detection over extended depths, scene segmentation and tracking, and better performance in inclement weather or under poor visibility. This leads to improvements in three-dimensional (3D) vision and object modeling that will have significant commercial impact in accelerating the development and deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle navigation and assistance. This will lead to higher commuting efficiency, reduced traffic fatalities, reduced traffic congestion, and reduced pollution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop an affordable and sustainable solution for treating and recycling household greywater. It is vital to conserve fresh water and reduce water waste. Household greywater recycling can reduce water consumption by treating gently used water and reusing it for everyday cleaning and personal hygiene. This project will develop and optimize several configurations of a novel plant-based greywater treatment system for household use. The system uses compact, modular containers to be deployed anywhere for easy scaling, and it uses embedded sensors to monitor water quality and system performance remotely. The treated water will meet drinking water standards and the plant-based system can also serve as a private garden or public green space. This technology can improve community resilience to water scarcity.

    This SBIR Phase I product advances the translation of a system using compact, modular containers that can be deployed where water infrastructure is expensive, scarce, or compromised. The system protects people from pathogenic bacteria and reduces nitrogen and phosphorus run-off, helping to prevent algal blooms and eutrophication of waterways. Water quality and system performance are monitored remotely using wireless sensors. Research and development for this project will include: 1) optimizing treatment performance to operate at a household scale; 2) prototyping specialized, modular containers; and 3) testing integrated sensors. To optimize treatment performance, key plants commonly used for wastewater treatment will be grown in a natural filtration media composed of various sizes of pumice, then subjected to various types and volumes of greywater. Within the modular containers, various configurations of plumbing, weirs, and air pumps will be tested to optimize oxygenation, filtration, and flow rates. During operation, a combination of sensor readings and professional laboratory testing will be used to analyze and validate water quality, as well as identify water quality parameters most critical for field operation and remote monitoring.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a new network architecture to improve the internet. Its original connectionless, packet-switched architecture was a departure from the traditional circuit-switched model and involved significant risks. To manage these risks, the original design focused on a simple network with smart endpoints. The result was scalable, robust and supported a wide range of communications technologies; however, it is limited in its ability to meet the performance, security, and policy needs of many modern network applications. Overprovisioning and expensive, complex, and fragile add-on technology are required to meet the needs of these new applications and these solutions may not scale This project will provide an enhanced, smart network that is scalable and robust, supporting performance and policy control while making efficient use of network resources. This will improve the next generation of internet applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the translation of networking with constraints. In this architecture, performance requirements are expressed as performance constraints, and policy requirements for security, multi-tenancy, and traffic differentiation as Boolean constraints on the resources used for an application. Routing with constraints computes the best set of paths per destination that provide the full range of performance and policies supported by the network, allowing traffic to be sent over paths that meet the needs of applications, and distributing the load more evenly over the network (simulations show a 10x increase in capacity). This approach is more robust because it is implemented as a part of the routing function, directly responding to network changes, and more efficient because it runs on the "native internet," eliminating overlays. Lastly, it improves security by implementing a default-deny communication model and is easier to configure based on its declarative, "what" configuration model. This project is focused on characterizing and mitigating risks remaining in this architecture and demonstrating the feasibility of this approach through the development of an operational proof-of-concept.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve resource efficiency and sustainability
    to the mining industry. \"Red mud\" is a hazardous waste product of a key step
    in aluminum production. For every ton of aluminum produced, 2.5 tons of red mud
    are pumped into a tailings pond. 120 million tons of red mud are produced annually,
    with over 30 billion stored in tailings ponds around the world. This project advances
    a technology to reduce the volume of waste with innovative metals extraction,
    creating a viable source of metals from waste.  This process could also create
    a supply of critical metals for electric vehicles, wind energy, and other applications.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop an end-to-end process for red mud
    processing. It will utilize ionic liquids as highly selective solvents enabling
    precise separation of a variety of different metal compounds from a mixed and
    variable inorganic feedstock.  Compared to current industrial practices that typically
    operate above 1000 degrees C, this approach allows a much lower temperature operation,
    drastically reducing the energy consumption and thus the cost of metal material
    processing. Additionally, the unique properties of ionic liquids at low temperatures
    make them ideal for use as electrolytes in electrochemical processes producing
    pure metal materials. The proposed project will conduct a feasibility study at
    laboratory scale.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broadder impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of microfluidic devices for life sciences research. Currently, devices with high-resolution microchannels are typically manufactured using sophisticated cleanroom microfabrication facilities, requiring technical expertise, high costs, and long turnaround times; these factors inhibit their use. This project will enable rapid manufacturing of customized microfluidics devices with substantially lower costs and turnaround times. This technology will impact research in applications including fundamental cell biology, drug screening, cellular therapy, toxicity testing, and tissue engineering.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance the translation of hybrid laser printing (HLP), combining the quick and large-scale printing capability of Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) with precision processing of additive multiphoton polymerization (MPP) and subtractive multiphoton ablation (MPA) into a single versatile machine. Technical challenges in material discovery and scalability will be addressed in this work: 1) Discover new materials not only compatible with HLP process but also showing the necessary durability, transparency, biocompatibility, and impermeability to fluids; and characterize key HLP parameters, such as ablation z-range used in MPA mode and dead-zone thickness used in CLIP mode; and 2) Scale the maximum printable size of HLP process using a novel multiscale CLIP strategy combined with a step-stitch projection printing method. The project will develop a prototype for life sciences applications.

Current membranes that require high humidity levels and low temperatures for operation complicates fuel cell thermal and water management components in heavy duty fuel cell systems. The proposed solution advances the development of a new membrane serving as a drop-in replacement to enable low humidity and elevated operating temperatures.

    This SBIR Phase I project will use porous polymer supports to translate a nanocomposite material that exhibits both low humidity and elevated temperature proton conductivity into a standardized solution for a proton exchange membranes. Furthermore, the composite materials will be added at high volume fractions to confer additional benefits in mechanical stability and lower gas permeability. The project activities include material translation into supported membranes, membrane composite formulation optimization, measurements of key membrane properties, and demonstration in a fuel cell stack. If successful, the project would yield new proton exchange membranes that enable operation under low humidity – elevated temperature conditions to simplify fuel cell systems while extending system durability.

    are at risk today. The innovation introduces a scalable method to plant heat-resistant
    corals to rejuvenate dying reefs. The technology is a multi-arm dexterous robot
    crawler. Planting one nursery coral every 10 seconds, with a cluster of three
    robots, the technology is capable of planting 100x faster than any method currently
    in use. This intervention will have a direct and beneficial impact on environmental
    restoration, marine ecosystems, and the tourism industry. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project will design a coral planting robot that traverses the ocean floor and
    performs complex tasks. Challenges include creating an autonomous wet chain and
    producing a wet chain sled, as well as addressing recharging difficulties.  Planting
    must take place where the coral is bound sufficiently so that it is not dislodged
    by waves or currents. Other technical challenges include identifying exposed hard
    surfaces as well as healthy coral to leave it undisturbed.  This project will
    enable reintroduction of key species with different environmental tolerance.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the reliable detection of food-borne pathogens in meats in 4 hours.  The time savings will dramatically reduce holding costs for food manufacturers and bring food to consumers one day earlier through an improved food-safety test. The proposed technology will address the major bottleneck for rapid bacterial detection in food samples, which is not detection itself but rather the sample preparation step known as bacterial enrichment. In this step, the sample is incubated for 20 or more hours to allow the bacteria to multiply and reach detectable levels. Bacterial enrichment has been dubbed 'the 100-year problem in food-safety and microbiology,' and there is currently no alternative. The proposed project will enable food-safety monitoring tests at a lower cost, improving food safety, saving billions of dollars in recalls, and reducing holding costs of food production.  Moreover, getting ground beef to retailers’ shelves a day earlier can reduce food waste in ground beef by an estimated 50%. Because beef is so energy-intensive to produce, this waste reduction would save trillions of gallons of water and prevent the release of billions of pounds of methane and greenhouse gases every year.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to explore translation of a unique microfiltration-based enrichment technology to separate and concentrate pathogens from ground beef.  This will enable the detection of a single pathogenic bacterium in 4 hours, with a limit of detection consistent with regulatory guidelines. The proposed technology combines washing, microfiltration and sedimentation with the addition of chemical agents to separate and concentrate the bacteria from the sample. The  research plan includes optimizing the conditions and chemicals to stabilize and subsequently digest protein aggregates in solution that are deleterious to the concentration of the bacteria; demonstrating the technical feasibility by consistently and reliably detecting 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU) in 375 g of ground beef; and exploring the performance-cost trade space.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of new disinfection devices that will reduce the number of food- and water-related illnesses.  This project will reduce spreading of infectious diseases, particularly in hospitals, nursing homes, farms, and veterinary clinics. The devices will be used to generate locally on-demand hydrogen-peroxide-based food-grade disinfectant using only water and electricity. The disinfectant will be used during the washing of fresh produce and ready-to-eat food, food packaging, and commercial ice-makers, where conventional disinfectants are not applicable in reasonable concentrations because they would leave residuals, including harmful byproducts and a strong unpleasant odor. The devices will also be used for the direct disinfection of drinking water, ice-makers, and recycled water. The devices will be especially useful for water disinfection in remote locations, where electricity can be generated using local and/or renewable energy sources.  On-demand decentralized water disinfection can be useful in remote locations and disasters affecting centralized clean water supplies.

    This SBIR Phase I project utilizes properties of low-energy electric discharge in water for efficient generation and recombination of hydroxyl radicals that result in the production of hydrogen peroxide with low energy consumption. The technology development includes: 1) Positioning of electrodes in a controlled water stream; 2) Optimization of the power supply; 3) Development of a water circulation system with appropriate local pressure control; 4) Development of an efficient use of the treated water to minimize total consumption of electricity.  Verification and validation will take place through standard methods to optimize the system’s disinfection efficiency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate applications of a new high-performance mechanical gearbox. Electric motors account for approximately 23 percent of electricity consumed in the United States and roughly 63 percent of manufacturing sector electricity.  An improvement in geared motor technology can help realize energy savings.  A magnetic gear creates speed change without any physical contact, requires no gear lubrication, has inherent overload protection, has low acoustic emissions and low starting torque. Due to its contact-free torque production, a magnetic gear has the potential for a long lifetime while operating at high efficiency.  This project will advance the development of a magnetic gearbox, with many potential applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the trade space of magnetic gearboxes with regard to efficiency, thermal stability, and torque density and the potential trade-offs with respect to cost.  Multiphysics-based numerical and analytic modeling co-design techniques will be utilized to explore the thermal and mechanical sizing trade-offs impacting the efficiency of the magnetic gears while mitigating magnet demagnetization. The proposed designs will utilize a unique laminated magnet array combined with the laminated slotted modulator.  The project will explore the design trade-offs with respect to stack length and mechanical deflection in the context of the magnetic and thermal design.  The project will demonstrate the efficiency and performance capabilities of a magnetic gearbox compared with an equivalently sized mechanically geared motor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of core-shell nanomaterials for sensitive detection of low-energy radioisotopes commonly used as molecular labels and tracers in quantitative biological, chemical and environmental studies. These nanomaterials can be used in place of traditional methods for measuring low-energy radioisotopes and offer greater sensitivity and better sample compatibility, while also resulting in less hazardous waste. The technology platform is expected to demonstrate several advantages over other methods in particularly challenging, information-rich areas of research, including detection of molecules within living cells. The nanomaterials platform, with further development, will also allow for the simultaneous detection of multiple compounds, an important factor in the study of complex biological samples. These advances will provide critical new tools for bioscience research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the sensitivity of a novel core-shell nanomaterial platform and develop a basic template for multi-color, multiplexed assays as well as an accompanying first-generation instrument capable of translating these advances to commercial application.  Radioisotope labels remain the gold standard in a wide range of quantitative biological, chemical and environmental studies and have played a critical role in the investigation of biological systems for almost a century. However, the low energy and short penetration depth of the most commonly used radioisotopes necessitate the use of liquid scintillation counting, solid scintillation counting or scintillation proximity assays for detection.  These assays are often incompatible with living systems, are not readily multiplexed and/or provide limited time-resolved measurement capabilities. The goals of this project are: 1) advance nanomaterial preparation to yield higher reproducibility and sensitivity signals; 2)  yield multicolor materials for simultaneous multiplexed assays; and, 3) generate a dual color scintillation counter than enables and demonstrates the utility of the platform for multiplexed assays. These goals will be accomplished by exploring a variety of scintillant fluorophores and polymer linkages in parallel with instrument design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a new camera solution for night or day and in adverse weather. Today's automatic driver assist systems are often inadequate for identifying pedestrians at night or in poor conditions.  This project will demonstrate a camera solution that will operate day and night, in all weather, and detects and classifies pedestrians, cyclists, animals as well as vehicles (either moving or stationary), thereby unlocking safer vehicle operation and saving lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a shortcoming of contemporary autonomous vehicle sensors by introducing a high-resolution 3D sensor that performs well in any lighting condition and most weather conditions. The research builds upon light field, or plenoptic, technologies proven effective in the visible domain and applies them to the thermal domain with additional innovations. A purpose-built microlens array (MLA) is coupled with a mid-wave infrared (MWIR) camera and new thermal computational photogrammetry algorithms to deliver dense 2D and range information with sufficient detail to quickly classify surrounding objects. In particular, it will be shown that 3D MWIR video is ideally suited to readily detect and classify objects that may move such as pedestrians, vehicles and animals.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the development of solutions
    for the fish processing industry. Current fish fillet preparation depends highly
    on visual inspection and manual trimming by trained technicians to identify and
    remove blemishes and food-borne parasites, which remain a significant cost of
    seafood preparation. Preparation of seafood by hand also poses significant health
    risks for consumers. The presence of human technicians means significant portions
    of seafood processing must be performed at room temperature, increasing the risk
    of bacterial infection and enzymatic degradation. This decreases the freshness
    and quality of the final product, while increasing chances of foodborne illness.
    Additionally, the manual detection rate for nematode infections can be as low
    as 50% under industrial conditions due to the small size of the infections and
    the potential depth in the fish. The proposed automated hyperspectral imaging
    (HSI)-based platform addresses these issues by (1) fully automating the complete
    fish processing supply/value chain, (2) obviating industry dependence on manual
    inspection and (3) being much less error-prone and more precise than manual inspection
    and trimming, reducing lost yield and promoting safer products for consumers.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance
    the development of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system for the automatic processing
    and remediation of fish fillets. HSI has already been validated in the detection
    of anatomical features of fish fillets and detection of harmful parasites like
    nematodes. However, its use has not been validated on an industrial scale. The
    proposed research will focus on: (1) compilation and annotation of a fish fillet
    data set, (2) training and validation of deep learning algorithms to detect fish
    fillet center line and nematode infestations, and (3) assessing the feasibility
    of using a state-of-the-art robotic actuator and customizing it for automatic
    nematode removal with the company's novel algorithms. The result will be a computer
    vision platform capable of recognizing nematodes/other foodborne parasites, detecting

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a novel imaging microscopy technique for next-generation semiconductor defect inspection and material characterization. The technique is based on ultrafast spectroscopy and is uniquely able to measure functional material parameters over a rapidly raster-scanned image. The semiconductor industry relies on process control to maintain high yield and to prevent the propagation of faults through the manufacturing process.  Semiconductor inspection represents a market of nearly $5 B in size and generates an estimated 15% of spending in the semiconductor industry. As the materials used in semiconductor devices evolve, so too must the inspection techniques. Many next-generation materials for various applications, such as solar energy and displays, are not pristine single crystals, and their inspection requires new technologies.  The proposed project will advance the development of the next-generation materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to investigate translation of real-time imaging via ultrafast spectroscopy. The primary challenge of this project is that ultrafast spectroscopy scans at a single point typically take seconds to minutes, and a useful imaging system must raster a point excitation over a wide area containing thousands of pixels. This Phase I effort will develop a method and metrics for this technique, using images with substantially fewer samples. The project will explore methods to measure trapped states and defects that degrade semiconductor functionality. Performance goals include accelerating the speed of single-point spectroscopy by two orders of magnitude. Longer-term goals include integration of ultrafast spectroscopy with microscopy for materials analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to explore an innovative, highly sensitive, rapid, compact and inexpensive system for detection of contaminants known as endotoxins. If pharmaceutical products or implantable medical devices contaminated with endotoxins come into contact with the bloodstream, they can cause a rapid rise in core body temperature followed by a severe shock, possibly fatal even before the problem is diagnosed. An estimated 70 million endotoxin tests are performed each year in the US alone. However, the conventional methods suffer from limited sensitivity and speed or chemical interference issues. The proposed project will advance the development of an endotoxin detection system using a novel optical biosensor for quick, precise detection of low levels. The proposed system can potentially be applied to sepsis diagnosis in acute care.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will address endotoxin testing for pharmaceutical quality control. The proposed approach will use a different physical parameter, refractive index (RI), to sensitively monitor the early onset of the gel-forming process in a mixture of analyte solution and Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL). Endotoxin concentrations will be correlated with the changes in RI due to the coagulation of LAL. A unique photonic-crystal biosensor will be used to monitor changes in RI with high speed (<5 min.) and high sensitivity (0.000025 EU/mL), 200 times higher than the state of practice. This crystal will be used in a total internal reflection (PC-TIR) configuration, with an imaging system to monitor the sensor's state. The project will conduct rapid prototype iterations through 3D printing. Technical objectives include:  (1) design and construct a prototype; (2) conduct verification and validation in the presence of typical interfering species; (3) evaluate assay speeds for testing of radiopharmaceuticals with a short half-life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to revolutionize the electrostatic discharge (ESD) prevention market. Currently available ESD mitigation products often inhibit the mobility of the user, lack reliability, or are prohibitively expensive. The proposed system enables reliable and economical wireless prevention of electrostatic shocks for customers handling sensitive electronics or working near explosives, offering increased safety and productivity. The development has the potential to increase employee efficiency and manufacturing reliability in various electronics-based industries. The status quo, a tethered grounding wrist strap, severely inhibits the mobility of the user, and leads to considerable potential for neglect or misuse by careless employees. Where workers might have abstained from using tethered wrist straps because of their inconvenience, the proposed innovation will decisively prevent disruptive or even catastrophic ESD events. The proposed innovation has applications in other markets to alleviate the burden and potential danger of frequent electric shocks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is expected to advance the state of the art in antistatic technology. Preventing electrostatic discharge is crucial when working with sensitive electronics or in hazardous environments. The project will develop a reliable wireless device that equalizes the wearer's electrostatic charge. The system developed here will reliably sense when the electric potential of a capacitive object surpasses a threshold relative to its adjacent environment. Second, a miniaturized charge transfer device will actively expel the excess charge from the body to its surroundings. Lastly, the two components will function harmoniously in a discrete package to reliably keep the user's electric potential equalized. An experimental testbed has been developed to mimic the charged human body and verify technical aspects of the core innovation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is to develop an accessible, rapid, low-cost method to discover and create new high-performance alloys; these alloys could potentially be tailored to specific applications by additive manufacturing.  Currently, alloy development and part manufacturing often utilize a "one-size-fits-all" approach allowing for limited alloy customization.  In most cases, where new materials are created to increase performance, costs can be prohibitive.  Metal additive manufacturing disrupts such conventions, creating opportunities for manufacturing low-volume, niche parts, but still material options remain limited. A new approach could enable a suite of specialized high-performance alloys that directly scales to functional parts, for use by companies of all sizes. This proposal aims to develop the necessary tools and implement this approach to create a new copper-based alloy targeting the injection molding industry to significantly reduce part production times.

    This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel sample evaluation method to discover and create new metal alloys for laser-based additive manufacturing processes.  The effort will utilize low-cost, rapid testing techniques to evaluate alloy chemistries on a laboratory scale so that the processing-structure-properties relationships can be determined for direct scale up in an additive manufacturing framework.  The chemistry selection will utilize thermodynamic modeling and simulation, low-cost test coupon generation, and a rapid experimental procedure to simulate the thermal history experienced in laser powder bed fusion, allowing for both reduced experimentation timelines and direct feedback into process models for validation and improving accuracy.  The method will be validated by creating a novel copper-based alloy with improved strength and thermal conductivity over the current state-of-the-art.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to offer a unifying backend that will enable seamless and scalable visual data access for Machine Learning (ML) deployments. This is achieved by removing the need for a fragmented system design from numerous independent products in an otherwise unified pipeline. Improvements in ML have made it possible for businesses to extract insights from information-rich visual data such as images and video. Handling big-visual-data for ML and query purposes requires storage and access methods designed for visual ML. With the current off-the-shelf alternatives, ML engineers and data scientists are forced to merge unprepared data solutions to address visual data management. Businesses pay the technical debt in the form of a) extra data platform resources, b) talent mismatch when ML engineers and data scientists are forced to engineer infrastructure, and c) delayed product launches. This project creates a unified system with one solution across the various stages of ML starting from data collection, curation, to training, inference, and business queries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to a novel data management platform designed for large-scale visual data, with an interface specialized for Machine Learning (ML) and Expert Insights queries. The project aims to build infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent clients, trillions of metadata entities, and petabytes of visual data, as will be common in the domains with increasing use of visual data. The platform is scalable without affecting performance, particularly for the emerging area of visual data management for ML deployments. The work will include visual data storage when receiving data from a large number of IoT-like devices and a ML-aware application programming interface for low-latency, high-throughput access of big-visual-data.  The scalable metadata database is designed to exploit new memory technology and novel caching and tiering methods using content-based knowledge of image/video data via novel formats.

    The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to investigate novel noninvasive methods for detecting and quantifying material in the upper esophagus. Reflux occurs when a bolus of gastric contents flows in reverse from the stomach into the esophagus. Symptoms of reflux can include chronic cough, choking, difficulty breathing or swallowing, upper airway infections, and chest pain, but these symptoms can also be associated with other serious medical conditions. The proposed technology will aid clinicians in quickly assessing a patient’s symptoms to determine if reflux is the underlying cause. A noninvasive diagnostic modality for assessing reflux could save the healthcare system $10 billion annually, allow clinicians to provide improved care to their patients, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs to the 80 million Americans who are affected by reflux-related symptoms.

    The proposed STTR Phase I project will advance a technology using pulse-echo ultrasound and proprietary algorithms in a new non-conventional way to create an acoustic signature that can detect and differentiate a bolus in the esophagus. The esophagus distends in response to a bolus of material, eliciting the esophageal layers to change with respect to one another. Those changes can be observed with ultrasound sensors placed externally on the skin. This project will develop and validate electronic hardware, software, and custom ultrasonic transducers. This data acquisition system will be used to collect pulse-echo ultrasound data in an approved clinical early feasibility study. Data will be collected from patients undergoing modified barium swallow studies. The ultrasound data will be synchronized with the video-fluoroscopic images allowing for the development of a classifier algorithm which can automatically detect when a bolus is present at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the proposed STTR Phase I project is to build a non-invasive medical device for fetal health monitoring to assist obstetricians in avoiding unnecessary cesarean-section surgeries (C-Sections). Despite significant cost and clear evidence of health risks associated with C-Sections, many infants are delivered via C-Sections. The high C-section rate and the associated additional cost and health complications result in part from inaccuracy of existing electronic fetal monitors, which generate many false alarms for fetal distress. The goal of this project is to address this problem by developing a non-invasive device so obstetricians may conveniently and accurately assess fetal health during labor and delivery.

    The proposed STTR Phase I project is to advance a breakthrough technology for non-invasive, transabdominal measurement of fetal arterial blood oxygen saturation (FSpO2). The underlying principle of operation is to shine light in the abdominal area at two specific near-infrared wavelengths and subsequently sense the small amount of diffusely scattered light transcutaneously. These measured signals require processing to correct for the maternal contribution and to infer intensity variations due to pulsation of fetal arteries. The proposed project will advance the development of a prototype and demonstrate feasibility of safe, robust and reliable transabdominal FSpO2 measurement in hypoxic fetal animal models.

- abstractText: "This broader impacts/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project
    is to enhance patient safety by addressing the most devastating and costly risk
    associated with robotic-assisted and standard laparoscopic surgical procedures
    – undetected bowel perforation.  More than 15 million such procedures, including
    hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, prostatectomy, oophorectomy and
    others, are performed annually.  While the incidence of undetected bowel perforation
    is relatively low at 0.3 – 1.0%, the consequences for more than 40,000 patients
    annually are severe, and the incremental costs of caring for those patients substantial.
    \ Detection of inadvertent bowel perforation during the initial surgery would
    enable surgeons to effect repair at that time, avoiding unnecessary patient suffering,
    billions in associated costs and a 5% mortality rate.  Those patients who do not
    die are subjected to multiple corrective surgeries, extensive antibiotic treatment
    and potentially lengthy intensive care convalescence.  Patient safety concerns
    and the significant cost of corrective care, which can easily exceed $100,000
    per patient, dictate the need for a low-cost solution. The proposed project will
    advance the development of intraoperative detection of bowel perforation, allowing
    for immediate repair and avoidance of negative outcomes.  This can be accomplished

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve job-site safety of dry-stacking installation of masonry walls without binding mortar through the use of novel Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU). The AIMU multi-component wall system combines the advantages of wood and those of concrete and is potentially applicable for mid-rise multi-family housing, a key component of affordable housing stock in the US and worldwide.  These AIMUs can be laid quickly, safely, and accurately, reducing time and labor for cost-effective construction in the US and globally.  The proposed construction platform will improve durability and offer lower lifetime costs than standard wood-based wall construction.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will further develop a construction technology using masonry blocks via dry-stacking without binding mortar.  Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU) are made of cellular lightweight concrete (CLC) and an activated adhesion. The proposed work will conduct testing to confirm the AIMU's ability to fill incursions and block irregularities, evaluate interfacial shear resistance between the interlocking features, and evaluate the interfacial adhesion activated through pressure or moisture. These fundamental properties are critical to resolving the primary barriers for translation of dry-stack masonry construction technology. The project will also demonstrate rapid outdoor dry-stacking AIMU installation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide critical development of a rapid diagnostic test capable of delivering the antibiotic resistance profile of a sample collected from patients suspected of suffering from urinary tract infections (UTIs). In the US there are approximately 8 million UTIs, and an increasing number of are caused by drug-resistant bacteria that significantly complicate the treatment of these infections. In general, patients suffering from a drug resistant UTI take longer to receive appropriate treatment, resulting in a greater risk of disease progression and onset of secondary comorbidities.  Diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify drug-resistant UTIs will have a strong and positive impact on the treatment of these infections. The proposed work aims to optimize and expand the diagnostic capacity of a first-generation diagnostic assay to create a fully comprehensive test that can detect a drug-resistant UTI in minutes.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology (DETECT), developed to detect low-abundant beta-lactamases produced by uropathogens to hydrolyze beta-lactamase antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. The presence of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens can greatly complicate clinical decision-making because these pathogens are regularly resistant to the first-line antibiotics considered for treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). DETECT, applied as a diagnostic system, holds the potential to significantly improve the care of UTIs because it enables rapid identification of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens directly from urine samples. The clinical feasibility of the technology has been demonstrated previously using clinical urine samples, first targeting a subset of beta-lactamases known as CTX-Ms. The proposed work aims to tune and optimize the first-generation system to offer a comprehensive diagnostic test that can accurately identify all of the clinically important beta-lactamases. This technology provides a simple, low-tech, and cost-effective way to inform patient treatment without the need of processing, urine sedimentation or centrifugation, or sophisticated instrumentation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop silent assistive robotic arms and end-tools for new robotic applications. The lightweight and dexterous tools – on the end of an agile robotic arm – will be able to perform intricate tasks such as cutting, pinching, and grasping for uses as diverse as panning/tilting cameras, to assembly tasks, to picking soft fruits and berries. Beyond improved cost and energy efficiency, these new devices will enable new personal robot applications. In addition, due to their simplicity and significantly lower weight and size, the proposed products will consume fewer natural resources than their current counterparts and can be more easily recycled due to the smaller number of components, ultimately enabling greater use of assistive robotic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the potential of using using Shape Memory (SM) and Superelastic (SE) nitinol wires instead of motors. SM/SE wires are alloys of Nickel and Titanium that contract aggressively when heated with electrical current, producing large forces and modest stroke; they can enable lighter, more efficient robotic joints and tools to perform a variety of human tasks. The technical objectives are to design a lightweight, agile, and silent robotic arm and end effectors utilizing SM and SE nitinol wires to both drive and sense position and forces. The end effectors will be a pincher/gripper and a cutter. The arm and end tools will be designed for tasks and loads typically performed by human hands, creating new tools for applications and loads between delicate surgeries and larger-scale industrial usage.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a drone propulsion technology

    this technology will be unmanned solutions for wildland firefighters. Applications
    include on-demand logistics solutions for supplies and large-area controlled ignition
    solutions, and ultimately around-the-clock air support for firefighters, where
    currently only 8 hours of air support per day is available. It has been suggested
    that every 10% reduction in time to contain a fire is worth approximately $300
    M in savings in suppression costs alone. The overall wildfire suppression market
    in the US is estimated at $6.5 B, and additional opportunities exist in the the
    commercial unmanned air system market (estimated to grow to $34 B by 2022) and
    urban air mobility. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I

    to new capabilities and missions. Electric-only multi-rotors offer limited flight

    are to develop the control algorithm for parallel hybrid multi-rotor control,
    implement this scheme on a prototype aircraft, quantify overall system efficiency,
    and quantify flight performance. It is anticipated that parallel hybrid control

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is to advance energy storage technology for the large-scale implementation of renewable energies, such as solar and wind. Not only would it be useful in large centralized grids, butregions with isolated micro-grids would benefit greatly from cheap, robust energy storage that can tolerate a wide range of conditions without negative environmental impact. The new technology would also find uses outside of energy storage, such as electric motors, propulsion systems, public transportation, and satellites.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a practical superconductor-based bearing for flywheel energy storage applications by overcoming some limitations that have previously been obstacles to commercialization. We will explore how new geometries can impact the requirements for stabilization; by modifying the arrangement of permanent magnets with respect to each other, the amount of external force required can be reduced. The project will include a simulation of the electromagnetic fields of the proposed designs and analyzing the stability, stiffness, efficiency, and other parameters. Substantially reducing the amount of external force required will allow it to implement superconductor-based bearings into commercial systems with low-cost, compact, and efficient cryocoolers that have become widely available in recent years. The project will improve the safety of flywheel energy storage systems by simulating a laminar-type flywheel composed of partially decoupled sheets, seeking to understand failure mechanisms and maximum rotational speeds.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result from the introduction of a state-of-the-art driver monitoring system using artificial intelligence to detect distracted driving or poor driving practices. It can also be used for driver coaching and education, as well as to improve driver attention. The system will help minimize accidents and create safer roads and work environments. End users include automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), commercial fleet operators, taxi and ride-sharing companies, heavy machinery and crane operators, rail and aviation operators, and operators of specialized transportation systems, such as school bus services and charter vehicles.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will exploit data from different camera and inertial sensors inside a vehicle to monitor and assess the attention of the driver. The driver’s gaze and upper body pose will be evaluated separately using artificial intelligence (AI) methods and the results combined to generate an overall estimate of the level of driver distraction. The proposed framework is expected to generate reliable results even in cases of high face occlusion. The technical objectives of the project include to: 1) Explore supervised and unsupervised methods to track the driver's body movement using depth and RGB sensors, addressing the challenges and drawbacks of current vision-based algorithms in real-world driving conditions; 2) Design a novel deep learning framework to integrate the driver's body pose with his/her attention level to infer driver's activities (e.g., such as using portable devices, eating, drinking, and other activities); 3) Develop new models of driver visual attention to obtain confidence levels in the estimated driver's gaze, estimated shoulder pose and joints positions; 4) Develop multi-modal end-to-end deep learning frameworks that integrate multiple sensors to provide important features for monitoring and assisting the driver; 5) Implement the system on low-power commodity hardware that is cost-effective and scalable.

    start validating  a novel high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device for
    minimally invasive treatment of brain tumors. The current standard of care is
    a highly invasive cranial flap resection, which not only risks infection, uncontrolled
    bleeding, and damage to healthy tissue, but also has prolonged post-operative
    recovery. Although minimally invasive laser ablation tools have been developed,
    they require the probe to be inserted directly into the target, which still risks
    bleeding and damaging tissue. Furthermore, while minimally invasive HIFU tools
    are available for other conditions, new technologies are needed to address more
    distant focal points and account for tissue-specific effects in the brain. This
    device is designed to: 1) reduce risks of infection, bleeding, and incidental
    damage to tissue; 2) reduce operating (and hence anesthesia) time; and 3) improve
    quality of life for patients by promoting faster recovery and improved aesthetics.
    The target addressable market is estimated to be nearly $1 B, with an additional
    $283 M per year for disposable kits and maintenance/upgrades. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project is developing a novel high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device
    offering a minimally invasive alternative to cranial flap resections to remove
    brain tumors. The key differentiating advantage of this technology is in the combination
    of: 1) a probe that is inserted through a minimally invasive burr hole in the
    skull, allowing a much smaller incision size compared to a cranial flap surgery;
    and 2) the use of HIFU, which can be focused at a distance from the tip of the
    transducer (without inserting the tip directly into the target). The main technical
    hurdles to be addressed are to 1) design a miniaturized therapeutic ultrasound
    transducer to allow safe insertion into the brain while maintaining similar acoustic
    properties to a larger transducer; and 2) include capabilities to steer the focus
    of HIFU to ablate larger targets of complex geometry. To achieve these goals,
    the project will:   1) create a digital model to miniaturize an existing prototype
    that maintains acoustic performance and integrates HIFU steering capabilities;
    2) fabricate a physical prototype matching the predicted acoustic power capabilities;

    The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to harvest a natural sunscreen for broader distribution.  This project will use a group of fast-growing microorganisms that make these ingredients. The challenge will be to harvest enough of the material to make effective and affordable sunscreens. The problem is akin to trying to collect all the "needles in a haystack". New tools that incorporate reusable analogues to "magnets" for capturing and releasing the sunscreen compound will provide a novel way to get the material out of a complex mixture of broken open cells and into the sunscreens. There is a lack of genuinely non-toxic, environmentally safe sunscreens in the U.S. market today. Melanoma, the most common cancer in the U.S., is a deadly form of skin cancer directly attributable to sun damage to skin, and conventional sunscreens are under pressure because of human health concerns and possible impacts on coral reefs. This work will provide a new class of sunscreens safer for people and marine life. Unlocking the potential of this nature-designed sunscreen will improve human health and the environment.

    This STTR Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility of using aptamers (small nucleic acids) to isolate mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from a complex mixture of compounds derived from cyanobacteria. Small molecules present challenges for aptamer development because they can be: difficult to immobilize, have multiple three-dimensional conformations, and few chemically distinguishing features. MAAs present unique challenges due to the similarity of their chemical structure with other cell lysate materials and wide variety of amino acid substitutions. This innovation entails the isolation and identification of the specific MAAs being produced, isolation of aptamers that are highly specific, and assessing process scalability. MAAs are not commercially available so reference standards will be derived from the culture broth.  These materials will be utilized as targets in aptamer selection using a proprietary single-stranded DNA library of aptamer sequences to identify suitable candidates by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Those aptamer candidates will then be screened and evaluated using an affinity purification workflow and absorbance-based microplate assay. The end result of this work will be to establish if this is a robust and scalable affinity purification method for MAAs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a tool to non-invasively measure inflammatory markers, microbes and metabolic profiles inside the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract for a variety of medical conditions. Initially, the device can be used for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This device and the data it collects will be used to improve the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes, that cumulatively cost the US economy over $200 billion per year. Given the centrality of gut physiology to human health, there will likely be additional uses of the technology in monitoring human health, eventually making it as routine and informative as a blood test is today in the practice of medicine.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will deliver a pill-sized device to the distal small intestine region of the human GI tract and trigger the collection of the luminal contents in that region.  The device will need to accommodate tremendous variation in the physiology of the human gut. The sampling device will encounter a biochemical environment ranging from pH 1 to pH 8. The time required for normal peristalsis to deliver the sampling device to the desired region of the GI tract will vary from 3 to 10 hours. Furthermore, cost and safety constraints strongly favor the use of a passive device with no actively powered sensors or actuators. A multidisciplinary approach using mechanical and material science innovations can meet these challenges and make the proposed device a platform sampling technology for IBD, and GI disorders in general.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is substantial, considering the fact that gut microbiome is now known to be one of the primary role-players in a range of diseases from asthma to inflammatory bowel disease. These diseases affect more than 120 million people and cost more than $580 B in the US.  Standard treatments for many of these diseases have variable efficacy and serious side effects, calling for novel therapeutic approaches.  While microbiome therapies (MBTs) have proven useful as a new class of therapeutics, their efficacy is largely affected by highly variable gut microbiota composition between individuals. Since there is no reliable approach to personalize MBTs prior to administration, MBTs are developed as a one-size-fits-all treatment. As a result, a major need exists for the development of cost-effective techniques for personalization of MBTs. By enabling new treatment scenarios and mitigating the risks associated with MBT treatments, our technology will help reduce the cost of treatment and the overall economic burden of these diseases worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses an essential need at the intersection of microbiome research and precision medicine by developing the first technology to efficiently and reliably personalize MBTs prior to their administration. A growing body of research is unearthing the close associations between a range of diseases and the gut microbiome. As a result, MBTs are emerging as a new paradigm in medicine to fight various diseases by modulating the gut microbiota. A primary challenge, however, is the highly variable compositional and functional landscape of the gut microbiome across individuals. Despite extensive research on gut microbiome medicine over that past several years, a reliable and robust technology has proven elusive due to many impediments. The biggest challenge in personalization of MBTs is the lack of a mechanistic or statistical link between individual-specific omics data and MBT-gut interactions. Using machine learning techniques and advanced optimization approaches, we will develop a computational platform as a virtual, cost-effective tool to personalize MBTs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR project proposing a novel broad spectrum insecticide safe for humans, expected to be safer than synthetic insecticides.  It will be used in conventional and organic farming, as well as personal protection/mosquito repellent products, costing significantly less than the products currently on the market. Crop losses due to insect pests cost billions of dollars and the limited classes of insecticides are vulnerable to the constant threat of resistance.  In addition, the lack of specificity creates broad risks due to pesticide residues polluting food and water and causing environmental damage. In particular, organic farming needs effective bioinsecticides for economically sustainable yields. The proposed product will have applications to other mosquito-borne diseases without adverse effects on human health.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to combine an effective insect protein target with a new class of molecules. In particular, a single molecule and its analogs derived from easily produced and cheaply priced natural products create new options for cost-effective and scalable de-novo synthesis for mass production. A few separate molecules from this general class have been shown to possess the right mechanism of insecticidal activity specific to insects (not humans). The specific protein target has a well conserved active site across arthropods (insects). Preliminary technical feasibility has been established and the Phase I work plan will validate proof-of-concept for the proposed solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the elimination of flaring from oil and gas production. Globally, there were an estimated 150 billion cubic meters (5.3 trillion cubic feet) of flared produced gases in 2016 and around 10 billion cubic meters (353 billion cubic feet) in the U.S.  At $2 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) (wellhead natural gas price), the value of flared gases is equivalent to $10.6 B per year globally and $706 M in the U.S.  Gases are flared because processes converting them to liquids for transportation (GTL) are expensive and are difficult to execute at a smaller scale. Replacing customized process equipment with mass-produced engines enables significant cost and size reductions. An 8-liter diesel engine that costs ~$10,000 can convert 400 thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF)/day of gas to liquids, rather than a large-scale GTL plant costing ~$15,000/MSCF/day.   This project will develop a novel, ultra-compact and low-cost gas to liquids mini-plant.  The plant will process methane, ethane and propane near the wellhead (which currently would be flared and wasted) into methanol, a high value chemical that can be transported to market. If converted to methanol at a value of $432/ton, these otherwise flared gas volumes would be valued at $2 B/year for the US market and nearly $30 B/year globally.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use modified automotive internal combustion engines as small scale chemical reactors and compressors. The necessary pressure and temperature for the reaction is created in-cylinder by piston compression action and partial combustion. This project will develop a staged system of engines:  The first converts methane, ethane and propane into carbon monoxide and hydrogen; subsequently, produced gases will be processed in a second engine compressing them and converting them into methanol. This will be accomplished with a high surface area metal foam impregnated with a catalyst placed inside the piston bowl of the second engine. Phase I of the project will: 1) demonstrate a proof-of-concept engine that can synthesize methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and 2) conduct the systems engineering studies describing integration of the engine reactor into a compact GTL plant to be placed near the wellhead.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will bring a new family of "structural color" coatings to the commercial marketplace as an alternative to toxic pigments and dyes, as well as a new paradigm for controlling the flow of light. This project aims to improve the energy efficiency of buildings through a coating that can be applied to residential roofing materials during installation or at the original equipment manufacturer level.  The technology is a bottoms-up approach to the formation of reflective materials offering significant advantages over state-of-practice cool-roofing alternatives by retrofitting without changing the facade's appearance. The resulting product will rapidly increase adoption of cool-roof technologies due to improved performance without aesthetic loss, a key homeowner concern, leading to substantial energy savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses key risks and technical challenges associated with commercializing brush block copolymer based photonic crystals.  This forms an ideal advanced materials platform for large-area dielectric mirrors due to the low costs of the raw materials and the simplicity of "bottoms-up" fabrication by macromolecular self-assembly. To realize commercial applications, the chemistries for these reflective organic materials need to be optimized for exterior coating applications to resist degradation from natural weathering conditions such as ultraviolet radiation, rain, thermal cycling; furthermore, the formulation must be optimized for standard application.  This proposed activity will develop new synthetic routes, stabilization strategies, and the first manufacturing processes to demonstrate these unique advanced materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the critical market pain points and demand for damage-free, yet secure and repeatedly usable adhesive fasteners that can perform well on both dry and wet surfaces. This project develops a reusable adhesive fastener that is a non-tacky, quickly-reversible adhesive, exhibiting high joining strength and reversibility. Due to the unique mechanism the device uses to toggle its adhesion, this device leaves the underlying surface damage-free.  The fastener is easily removable, repeatedly usable, and potentially will have low manufacturing costs. Such an adhesive fastener enables the user to easily and securely mount and dismount moderately heavy objects without the risk of damaging or leaving residue on the mounting surface, even on moderately porous and rough surfaces.  Furthermore, since the adhesive fastener is water-resistant, high-performance fastening can also be applied in wet environments, expanding the potential market applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate an adhesive fastener that works with high reliability and durability in diverse environmental conditions, with effective activation methods.  Shape memory polymer (SMP) formulations and the mechanics at the adhesive contact interface will be optimized to make the  fastener more resistant to contact failure. Since the adhesive contact failure mode of this adhesive fastener is typically fracture, there will be significant efforts on refining the mechanical design to retard adhesive contact fracture, and the resulting performance in terms of joining strength and duration will be quantitatively determined. An optimized fabrication process for conductive SMPs will be developed by incorporating conductive fillers into the SMP material to enable continuous production, ensuring uniform product quality and enabling scalable manufacturing. For this purpose, the effective Joule-heating, shape memory effect, and final reversible adhesive properties of the conductive SMP upon conductive filler composition, concentration, and spatial concentration configuration will be investigated. The adhesive performance in wet conditions of the SMP will be demonstrated and systematically tested to minimum performance standards under a variety of liquid types and thermomechanical loading conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a unique continuous-fiber composite that is lightweight and offers enhanced impact resistance and energy absorbance compared to commercially available carbon fiber composites. The demand for advanced composite materials is expected to steadily increase both in the United States and worldwide due to rapid growth in aerospace and automotive applications, as well as defense and clean energy applications. Though valued for their high strength-to-weight and lightweight properties, traditional and commonly-utilized fiber-reinforced composites composed of carbon fiber or fiberglass tend to exhibit brittle properties and low impact tolerance. Lack of damage tolerance leads to various forms of localized and nonlocalized material failure, compromising the material's structural integrity and incurring replacement costs and scrap waste. Developing composite materials that can withstand impact scenarios and possess damage tolerance is necessary to enable more widespread adoption of these materials across a variety of applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore material development and processing methodologies to progress and optimize the performance of the proposed novel composite material. The project will evaluate the feasibility of formulations composed of different iterations of this material technology while evaluating pre- and post-processing techniques for performance and scalability. Additional refinement strategies such as enhancing the fiber-matrix bond for enhanced anti-crack propagation and energy distribution will also be explored. This will be coupled with testing methodologies demonstrating various material property classifications as well as application-specific, proof-of-concept testing to demonstrate performance effectiveness. The goal is to approach the isotropic properties and impact resistance of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the lightweight, high strength-to-weight performance of carbon fiber composites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create value for grape farmers by reducing crop damage from frost by delaying the time when the buds break in spring.  The innovation proposed will reduce the costs of frost management, decrease yield loss, and improve quality. Delaying bud break will also assist in labor management by increasing the operating window for optimal shoot removal.  Grapes are the highest value fruit crop in the U.S. and the sixth largest crop globally.  Grape production is highly influenced by the weather, with frost damage among the top weather hazards. Success in the grape market opens the door to deployment with many other fruit crops.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow grape growers to reduce frost damage and maximize resources for mechanization. This approach integrates many studies, including: biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, resistance to cold injury, and polymer sciences. Preliminary studies indicate the ability to resist wet conditions and regulate bud break by 10 to 14 days.  If the aims of this project are achieved, the technology will contribute significantly to farmers’ abilities to cope with present and future threats of spring frost, with current mechanization and available labor limitations, and will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools that address current and emerging challenges of climate change. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the spray through a series of in situ applications with partners in Washington and Illinois. In addition, the project will launch data analytics studies to guide the application timing of bud break delay technology by testing sensors for farm microclimate data acquisition and gaining access to critical data sources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will explore the development the High Efficiency Rapid Magnetic Erythrocyte Separator (H.E.R.M.E.S), a highly translational blood-plasma separation system enabling the decentralization of commercial blood testing. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in the majority of diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and have created a bottleneck in the translation of bench-to-bedside testing. H.E.R.M.E.S is a unique magnetic bead-based separation method to quickly obtain plasma free of red blood cells. The technology is a low-cost and standalone platform with the potential to augment the testing efficiency and translational ability of existing blood-based diagnostic tests. Specifically, this effort will examine the potential for H.E.R.M.E.S to augment Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diagnostic and viral load quantification testing in finger-stick and whole blood, when used with standard lab-based and rapid diagnostic assays. Access to higher quality HIV tests will have a major impact for public health and improved diagnostic outcomes. H.E.R.M.E.S will address the lack of availability of low-cost and efficient sample processing technologies and help introduce the next generation of robust point-of-care blood tests.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the implementation of a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in point-of-care testing environments. The technology will enhance current blood-testing capabilities at the point-of-care and has the potential to enable the development of highly robust diagnostic tests. This Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing laboratory-based and rapid diagnostic HIV assays. The compatibility of the separation assay will be verified by comparing the performance of the diagnostic assay with different sample types: blood, centrifuged plasma and H.E.R.M.E.S plasma. This proposal will explore the potential to use the unique sample type generated by H.E.R.M.E.S to enhance HIV diagnostic testing outcomes by providing earlier detection. The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample that will augment the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from building a computer vision platform that will help make communities more useful and appealing to their occupants regardless of demographic data, with shopping malls as the pilot application.  Shopping malls of the future will blur the lines between community center and retail space as malls become mixed-use spaces where people will not only shop, but will also live, work, and play. To make this transition, shopping mall companies need detailed demographic information regarding mall visitors. The company’s technology will enable improved state-of-the-art pedestrian movement and demographic classification, without collecting any personally identifiable information. This will enable shopping mall operators to understand and improve their tenant mix, and thereby better foster communities nationwide. The data generated could also benefit other industries by revolutionizing property analysis: governments can use demographic data to analyze changing populations and urban planners can use foot-traffic information to make cities cleaner and more efficient. The technology will enable a more detailed understanding of changing communities and how to help them thrive, without the privacy compromises that usually accompany video-based technologies. The company intends to remain at the forefront of privacy-preserving practices with regard to data collection and management.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will solve three crucial problems in video analytics for obtaining demographic information, while avoiding the need to collect personally identifiable information, namely: (1) classification of pedestrian demographics in a public setting, (2) accurate group detection and path (motion) analysis, and (3) stable path analysis using network camera imagery. There are currently no large-scale systems capable of accurately extracting both demographic and path information from network camera imagery. The proposed technology will analyze video data from a network of cameras placed throughout a shopping mall, extract demographic foot-traffic patterns to generate demographic and path data, and then permanently delete the video. Developing technology that effectively recovers from occlusions that arise in dense environments is crucial to the commercial adoption of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a bioabsorbable tissue sealant for use in the closure of internal surgical site wounds. Wound care is associated with significant healthcare and economic costs. Surgical wounds account for the majority of acute wounds, as there are over 100 million surgical incisions a year globally, where approximately 80% require a closure product. Improper or ineffective closure of surgical wounds can result in a number of complications, including infection, scarring, improper healing, and blood loss. Currently available products for use in closing internal surgical wounds are often limited in their effectiveness due to low versatility, safety concerns, and slow curing times. An ideal tissue adhesive would provide sufficient strength and be bioabsorbable, thus providing for effective wound closure for internal and external applications. Bezwada Biomedical seeks to meet this unmet need through the development of a polyurethane-based adhesive for internal surgical wounds that is biodegradable, easy to use, and biocompatible. Successful commercialization of this technology will provide clinicians and surgeons with an effective and versatile wound closure product for surgical applications, thus decreasing the likelihood of complications that significantly impact patient outcomes and increase the costs of care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a polyurethane-based tissue adhesive incorporating hydrolyzable linkage bridging using safe and biocompatible compounds through an innovative chemistry approach. The hydrolyzable feature differentiates the technology from existing absorbable polyurethanes and is the result of highly reactive aromatic isocyanates with a hydrolyzable link connecting the aromatic rings, allowing for safe and tunable degradation. The overall goal of the proposed program is to identify a single lead polyurethane formulation with two Technical Objectives:  1) synthesis of monomers and development of formulations; 2) assessment for physical, mechanical, functional, biocompatibility, and ease-of-use properties to identify the optimal formulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to combat online trade in counterfeit and illicit goods. The project will integrate the results of a decade of academic research on anonymous online ("dark net") marketplaces and modeling of counterfeit pharmaceutical online sales with novel monitoring solutions for traditional e-commerce marketplaces. It will allow for the development and validation through pilot customer tests of an integrated platform for automated continuous data collection and analysis of the major players in the counterfeit and illicit goods online business. Through automation, the proposed technology should considerably reduce costs to brand protection managers (and law enforcement), allowing them to use their limited resources more effectively. This work should also help address some pressing economic and public health issues linked to the proliferation of counterfeits, such as counterfeit drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate automation of many manual online counterfeiting monitoring activities. The project will also show that intuitive visual interfaces can help customers (law enforcement agencies, brand protection managers) have immediate access to higher-level objects more useful for investigative purposes. These higher-level objects include metrics on the amount of sales conducted by a specific entity, deduplication between vendors, or inventory clustering. To do so, the project will further develop automated classification and analysis using techniques that were prototyped in the research lab, scale these techniques up to a production environment to further minimize human intervention, and combine these techniques with novel algorithms developed for slightly different application cases (traditional e-commerce marketplaces).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from improving the quality of healthcare in the United States and reducing the associated costs for common elective surgery procedures through evidence-driven patient-physician matching. This technology will improve the quality of care and reduce the variation in costs associated with these procedures. The platform will better equip health facilities to deliver sustainable, high-quality care in an industry that is transitioning towards value-based care. The commercial impact of the project will result from generating savings to healthcare facilities. Personalized physician scheduling helps patients access the most beneficial care and has the potential to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. Facility-level cost reduction and patient outcome improvement enabled by this technology not only translates to cost savings for patients, but also increased capacity for the healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for reducing the variations in outcomes and costs in elective medical care procedures with respect to factors including physician availability, the impact of care teams on medical outcomes and cost, and the effects of physician training and learning over time. The approach will be based on a unique combination of data analytics, stochastic processes, and machine learning, applied to the patient-provider matching problem. The technical challenges to be addressed in this project include the dynamic nature of physician strengths, the difficulty in attribution of outcomes to individual physicians in a team, and the challenges in adapting to the databases of health facilities. The team will closely collaborate with healthcare partners, leveraging historical data on physician and team performance over time as well as their feedback to develop an impactful and scientifically justified prototype. Anticipated technical results include documentation of the results of the proposed research and a prototype version of the technology for use at the healthcare facility level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is rooted in the development of a large-scale synthesis for the manufacture of highly uniform hollow metal nanospheres for use by the military in potentially contaminated zones of operation, in rural settings with limited access to healthcare laboratories, or in the agricultural field for faster and more affordable detection of lower levels of food-based toxins and pathogens. Furthermore, establishing a source of these next-generation metal nanoparticles at commercially relevant levels of quality and quantity with consistent and predictable performance would pave the way for their expansion into other industries that could also benefit from their advantages, such as photocatalysis, water purification, and photomedicine.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will scale-up the production of hollow metal nanoparticles from the existing small-batch syntheses to a large-scale continuous flow process, with strict standards for the control of their size, shape, and optical response. Large-scale synthesis of highly uniform hollow metal nanospheres with controllable size has not been achieved to date, hampering the use and study of these advanced materials. A high-quality, high-volume production method will position hollow metal nanospheres for rapid commercial adoption in applications where they markedly outperform their solid counterparts, such as in color reporting for lateral flow assays (LFAs), where hollow gold nanospheres can offer a 10-fold improvement in assay sensitivity.  The primary objective of the proposed work is to determine the parameters necessary for a high-quality, high-throughput synthesis based on continuous flow, including reactor materials, chamber dimensions, precursor concentrations, flow rates, and reaction times. The major technical hurdle lies in the identification (within a very large parameter space) of suitable conditions for a successful and controlled synthesis; accordingly, a major component of this project is in-depth analysis and characterization of synthesized nanoparticles by optical spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Characterization results will be used to inform iterative reactor improvements. The resulting high throughput reactor will both advance the state of the art of nanomaterial synthesis and enable new research by creating a consistent supply of commercially available hollow nanoparticles with reproducible physical properties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the state of the art of additive manufacturing, through development of a novel foam resin technology for rapid 3-D printing of ultra low-density parts with high strength-to-weight ratios. The demand for lightweight, high-strength printed parts is growing across all sectors of the manufacturing industry.  The additive manufacturing market is expected to more than double by 2026, with high resolution vat photopolymerization as its largest market segment (>$1 B).  By accelerating production speeds and overcoming size limitations that have limited manufacturing output to small products, the technology also opens the doors for general manufacturing. Within the automotive, aviation and shipping industries, for example, the technology will support lightweighted designs, thus increasing efficiency, while lowering energy consumption, material consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in lightweight printed parts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  will develop a novel method to modify the high resolution vat photopolymerization process, to enable 3D printing with resin that is foamed using a patent-pending process. Because the proposed technology can be adapted for use on most vat photopolymerization systems, industries can apply it to their existing resins, machines, and processes.  The technology will allow for the manufacture of lightweight parts with up to 75% gas fractions, translating to parts that are 75% lighter and less expensive to produce compared to traditional additive manufacturing processes.  In order to establish proof-of-concept and progress the technology toward commercialization, several critical objectives must be met. Materials that can produce strong, lightweighted products using this technology will be identified. Different types of materials will be investigated in experiments designed to vary the gas fraction in the cured foam, and at least 3 resin formulations will be selected to generate foams for further evaluation of their mechanical properties. The results of three types of tests (compression, impact, and 3-point bending) on foams printed using the proprietary PrintFoam process will be compared to other materials to demonstrate that the technology delivers materials with improved strength-to-weight ratios. In addition, plans for scale-up of the machine and technology will be generated.

In general, this will lead to faster product development and shorter time-to-market in the artificial intelligence market. Highly power-efficient machine learning accelerators make training and complex inferences possible on so-called "Edge" devices and can revolutionize the way machine learning tasks are performed for end users. By enabling fast and power-efficient Edge computing, this innovation benefits society by reducing data traffic while preserving privacy and data security since data never leave the device. The Total Addressable Market for hardware accelerators for machine learning applications was estimated to be around $1B in 2017 but will likely grow at a 50% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) until 2025 to $66 B. High power-efficiency and scalability of this innovation gives it an immense competitive advantage to penetrate different segments within this market.

    The proposed project aims to develop a fast, scalable and area- and power-efficient matrix multiplier for machine learning applications. Matrix multiplication is at the heart of all machine learning algorithms and is the most computationally expensive task in these applications. Most hardware accelerator solutions store inputs, weights and partial sums in memory and retrieve them sequentially in order to perform matrix multiplication. The data movements between memory and computational units dominate the overall power consumption and latency of the system. By performing computations in memory, a significant power and area savings can be achieved. This SBIR project seeks to develop a technology to perform mixed-signal matrix multiplication in memory to significantly improve the speed and power- and area-efficiency of machine learning accelerators. Phase I will involve the design and verification of a matrix multiplier that can perform machine learning tasks more efficiently.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a new imaging platform technology that has the potential to affect many areas including consumer imaging, medical imaging, spectroscopy, astronomy, surveillance, and defense.  Transitioning this technology into real applications will mean this technology can be used for personalized experiences, improved quality of life, and increased safety.

    The STTR Phase I proposed project will develop inexpensive, lensless imaging devices (contrary to the current state-of-art cameras, that rely on lenses to form a focused image), that can be integrated with internet-of-things (IoT) devices to gather visual data. Since the lens in a camera accounts for the vast majority of the cost and the weight, these devices can provide order of magnitude reductions in cost, allowing cameras to be integrated into a much larger array of home, auto, and city-scale smart devices. The research tasks in this project are: (1) developing fast, real-time algorithms for image reconstruction exploiting advances in optimization and machine learning (2) developing face detection, recognition, and tracking algorithms that operate with the lensless imaging platform for IoT applications like personalization, and (3) improving data communication (wired or wireless) to meet current and future IoT needs by exploring end-to-end system integration and optimization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project falls within the scope of the grand challenges
    in health informatics. There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment
    of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have
    been admitted into the healthcare system. Health care providers, however, have
    limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly
    constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control
    over patient behavior and limited ability to recognize stroke symptoms outside
    the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no
    system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time.
    Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems
    for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand
    the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking
    patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge
    of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric
    disorders and diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project addresses the real-time detection of stroke. Ischemic stroke affects
    700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth
    leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue
    plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only
    5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency
    room after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes
    after tPA and endovascular therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours
    for these treatments, respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying
    symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge.
    The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution
    to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in
    a timely manner. The solution will consist of a wearable device with multiple
    modalities, which are fed to a smartphone and a cloud-based analysis system for
    real-time analysis and detection. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically
    improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving
    IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    the power problem, which significantly limits the deployment and functionality
    of next generation wireless sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) nodes and inhibits
    their impact on energy and efficiency savings in the most needed areas of smart
    manufacturing, smart transportation, and building automation. Most high-impact
    IoT applications typically require miniaturization and placement of wireless sensor
    nodes in hard-to-service locations in vast numbers, where the battery replacement
    or electrical wiring is not practical or too costly. This research and development
    effort will explore the fundamental and technological limits of vibration energy
    harvesters, and development of novel micro vibration energy harvesters with high
    power density, multi-axis operation capability, and wider frequency bandwidth.
    These low-cost micro vibration energy harvesters aim to enable energy-autonomous
    wireless sensor nodes that will open up new markets and high-impact applications
    for self-powered IoT nodes, achieve energy savings and increased efficiency in
    multiple industries due to enabled continuous data gathering, reduce the ecological
    footprint of millions of wasted toxic batteries, and significantly decrease the

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a millimeter-scale vibration energy
    harvester that can provide high power density, multi-axis operation capability

    energy harvesters have limited practical applications in real life, as they suffer
    from large size, high-cost, low power density, high operation frequency, and extremely
    narrow frequency bandwidths. Moreover, commercial harvesters can only operate
    at a single vibrational axis and cannot harvest efficiently from complex three-dimensional
    vibration profiles found in real-life applications. This SBIR Phase I project
    will focus on novel device architectures to achieve a high-power density in a
    highly compact device volume and to harvest energy efficiently from low-amplitude
    vibrations along any spatial directions. In addition, new device architectures
    will be investigated to obtain further improved performance and additional functionalities.
    Analytical simulations and finite element analysis will be performed to optimize

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address a systematic behavioral health and
    substance use provider shortage, cost-effectively improve patient retention in
    treatment, and proactively treat chronic behavioral health patients. Left untreated,
    these conditions cost over $1 trillion annually and result in countless early
    deaths. Peer support is an effective tool to engage patients unwilling or unable
    to access clinical care, particularly in marginalized populations.  However, scaling
    peer support is challenging, with current online support forums rife with trolling
    and abuse. Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can extrapolate the emotional
    sentiment of text messages, automatically flagging clinically relevant or critical
    content. This allows clinicians to easily moderate groups by focusing their time
    on the patients most in need, while peers generate the touchpoints necessary for
    day-to-day engagement.\n \nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase

    in the group, 2)  developing a method of tracking the overall health and stability
    of a group by analyzing interactions among peers and 3) design new interfaces
    that effectively display all of the insights generated by the algorithms. These

    Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to provide the pharmaceutical industry with
    improved pre-clinical screening assay for oral drug absorption. Current in vitro
    methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable
    assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market.
    Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic
    drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore,
    a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow
    for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number
    of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition
    from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based
    on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine
    intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids.
    These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely
    than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug
    screening over currently used assays. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish
    that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine
    intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell
    lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability
    of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared
    with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive
    and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function
    in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to
    determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease
    and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models.
    Ultimately, quantitative data generated through these experiments will be imported
    into a commercial software to simulate the disposition kinetics of a predefined
    set of candidate drugs. Performances of the model predictions will be evaluated
    by comparing simulated vs. observed drug kinetic plasma data from the literature
    for validation purposes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is significant since the platform is an enabler of a range of high-speed wireless applications for the next generation of broadband communications. The proposed technology platform will solve some of the key challenges of millimeter-wave (MMW) wireless radios and networks and can serve a wide set of wireless related applications and markets, particularly the telecommunication backhaul and fixed wireless access markets, among others. This Radio Frequency (RF) front-end system, integrated with the base-band circuitry in a wireless module, provides the hardware necessary to enable the vision of a truly fiber-speed backhaul network for 10s of millions of 5th generation (5G) cell deployments to provide the ultimate network robustness, agility, with significant cost savings for the operators and businesses. This advanced wireless technology will enable rapid and robust roll-out of the next generation network as well as a wide range of broadband wireless applications and can play a pivotal role in overall pace of 5G technology penetration. This in turn will impact many industry sectors, ranging from smart transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare to smart city, and the Internet of Things.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an ultra-high performance MMW wireless RF front-end technology for the next generation of multi-gigabit applications. Driven by the rising demand of the data-intensive applications, there is a growing need for more advanced wireless equipment for high data-rate communications. That is why with the emergence of multi-gigabit applications, there is a significant focus on MMW technology as the frontier of the wireless communication. The existing MMW RF front-end technologies, however, are either limited in their functionality or suffer from high power-consumption, which makes them not suitable for emerging massive deployments such as 5G backhaul, last-mile broadband for enterprise and service providers, etc. As a result, there is a need for new MMW RF front-end technologies to unlock the full potential of fiber-speed wireless communications. The proposed technology offers an order of magnitude higher performance compared to the best-in-class wireless technologies and can serve as an enabler to multiple high-speed applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of (1) preventing server-level data breaches; and (2) increasing adoption of cloud computing; especially in sectors that inherently deal with sensitive data and are subject to regulation. This includes the healthcare and finance industries as well as government agencies. Data breaches are occurring at an alarming rate and affecting every industry and sector of government. This project enables customers to search and query data without ever needing to decrypt it, effectively protecting data against server-level breaches. Potential customers from the financial and healthcare industries said in interviews that their adoption of cloud computing had been slowed due to the sensitivity of some of their data. Their inability to use the cloud to store and analyze highly sensitive data is very costly since they have to build and maintain on-premise infrastructures to handle it. The outcome of this project will enable customers to make use of and benefit from cloud computing even for their most sensitive data. From a societal standpoint, this project increases user security and privacy and helps achieve regulatory compliance while investing less in cybersecurity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to design, build and evaluate a commercially viable encrypted relational database system. The project will tackle a variety of technical challenges that need to be overcome before this technology can see widespread adoption. The first is integration with existing database management systems (DBMSs). Commercial database systems benefit from over 40 years of research, optimization and engineering breakthroughs. While the new cryptographic techniques proposed for this project have many advantages in terms of security and efficiency, it is not a-priori clear how to integrate them into a standard DBMS without a complete re-design. To address this challenge, this project leverages a new algorithmic paradigm called emulation that seamlessly integrates these new cryptographic techniques with standard commercial DBMSs. The second challenge this project addresses is concrete real-world efficiency. The theoretical analysis of the proposed solution shows that it is asymptotically efficient. The proposed work, however, will show that it is also efficient in practice on real data and against real database benchmarks.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop an anti-cancer vaccine. A successful vaccine against cancer can potentially revolutionize cancer treatment and prevention by providing durable protection to patients and preventing relapse, without the harmful side effects commonly associated with chemo- and radiation- therapies. One of the major challenges in anti-cancer vaccine development is the low immunogenicity of cancer antigens, in particular tumor associated carbohydrate antigens. In order to overcome this, in this project, a new carrier system based on bacteriophage Qbeta will be developed. A representative carbohydrate antigen GD2 will be linked with bacteriophage Qbeta, which can elicit superior titers of antibodies that can kill cancer cells. Successful commercial development of such vaccines will greatly benefit cancer patients not only in the US, but also throughout the world. In addition to cancer vaccines, the bacteriophage Qbeta based carrier is a new platform technology to elicit powerful antibody responses. Biotechnological companies interested in vaccine development can adapt Qbeta as the carrier to target infectious diseases and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the Qbeta platform can provide an excellent starting point for the generation of monoclonal antibodies, which are among the top agents developed for therapeutics and diagnostics. Thus, the availability of a superior carrier can potentially address a wide range of biomedical needs.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design new bacteriophage Qbeta based carriers for next generation vaccines. Vaccines have had tremendous impacts on public health. Traditional vaccines commonly incorporate attenuated or killed bacteria or viruses as immunogens. With the enhanced requirements on safety, the field is focusing more on well-defined subunits as epitopes for vaccine design. As subunits tend to have lower immunogenicity, immunogenic carriers are critical to deliver the desired antigen to the immune system and to enhance the immune responses. However, there are only a few carriers available that have been validated in clinical studies. The limited choices of carriers can significantly reduce vaccine efficacy due to interferences from anti- carrier antibodies. This project develops a new class of immunogenic carrier based on bacteriophage Qbeta capable of eliciting superior levels of IgG antibodies to the target antigen compared to gold standard carrier proteins. Novel mutants of Qbeta will become available to elicit high levels of IgG antibodies against the target antigen. The utility of the new Qbeta carrier will be demonstrated in delivering a tumor associated carbohydrate antigen, i.e., ganglioside GD2 derivative, to induce potent anti-cancer IgG antibodies. When successful, the GD2 based vaccine will be a quantum leap for the field as it will be the first ever carbohydrate based anticancer vaccine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a novel wearable device for unobtrusively detecting changes in the lung health of patients with chronic respiratory disease. This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm
    labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable
    electronic patch for pregnancy monitoring in both clinical and home environments.
    Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies
    is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk
    of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow
    doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as
    needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing
    early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device
    will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant
    safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare
    costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most
    comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could
    become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers
    of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and
    elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers
    and insurance companies. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal
    and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely
    sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal
    heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments.
    The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to
    a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with
    doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology,
    proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged
    to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks
    gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment
    in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor
    will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an
    equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram,
    the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of
    FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate
    data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to provide medical workers and consumers
    the utility of continuous blood pressure monitoring with an easy to use adhesive

    While a patient is undergoing surgery, blood pressure is monitored because sudden
    drops have been linked to irreversible tissue and/or organ damage, resulting in
    post-operative complications and mortality. The traditional arm cuff blood pressure
    monitor is primarily used in surgical settings but while it is not invasive, the

    to non-invasively and continuously measure beat-to-beat blood pressure. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will advance a new device for
    non-invasive and continuously blood pressure monitoring.  Current devices are
    limited by their accuracy and temporal resolution. The proposed medical device
    is based on soft wearable pressure sensors that solves the cost, accuracy, and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve diagnosis of eye conditions with a better tool for ocular fluid biopsies. Ocular fluid biopsies are important in diagnosis and treatment, but this procedure is under-utilized due to flaws with the current method for collecting fluid; furthermore, the fluid in the eye is isolated from the rest of the body, so blood work does not help in diagnosis. Because of this, most ocular infections are diagnosed and treated based on their clinical appearance without additional data from fluid testing. This research will advance a new tool to collect ocular fluid safely and effectively. This will aid in diagnosis of sight-threatening conditions including macular degeneration, glaucoma and ocular infections, enabling earlier diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) I Project will advance a new medical device for ocular fluid biopsies. Ocular fluid biopsies can be used for conditions beyond infections in the eye. The proposed instrument will be designed specifically for collection of fluid from the front of the eye. Tasks include: (1) optimization of the needle to decrease the force of entry to enhance the surgeon’s control and decrease risk of injury; (2) investigation of the fluid dynamics of collection with the integration of a microfluidic chamber and specialized collection system designed to handle small fluid volumes because the current method leads to fluid loss and inaccurate results. Additional work will evaluate advanced engineering features to enhance safety for this procedure.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a diagnostic product that addresses
    patient safety and clinical decision-making for physicians managing patients taking
    Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs). DOACs are becoming the preferred drugs to
    reduce the risk of blood clots that can lead to significant adverse events, such
    as stroke. However, DOACs are part of the leading class of drugs implicated in
    adverse event-related emergency department visits. These adverse events place
    a significant burden on the healthcare system in the form of transfusions, exposure
    to blood products, platelet repletion, reversal therapies, and additional complications
    (e.g. infection, sepsis, multiple organ failure) driving longer hospitalizations,
    higher mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. In emergency situations,
    the rapid detection of DOAC anticoagulation is needed when planning for urgent
    care for surgery, serious trauma, drug overdose, emergency procedures, or monitoring
    for drug accumulation in cases of renal and liver failure.  This project proposes
    a diagnostic at the point of care. With an estimated 21 M patients globally taking
    DOACs, this technology could significantly reduce the $2.5 B in costs related
    to treating and correcting adverse events caused by the absence of DOAC information
    in emergency care situations.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I Project will demonstrate the feasibility of a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic
    chip for emergency room clinicians to manage bleeding risk and avoid overuse of
    drug reversal therapies, thereby improving patient outcomes while reducing healthcare
    costs. Currently there is no approved rapid diagnostic POC test that accurately
    identifies the type of DOAC drug a patient is using, nor how much of the drug
    is in the patient’s blood. An integrated microfluidic cartridge is proposed developed
    to manage blood distribution within the device, mix the blood with DOAC detection
    reagents, and provide an integrated assay result that evaluates the three important
    clotting factors in clot formation (fibrin/thrombin/platelets). The technology
    is unique in that, unlike other coagulation tests, it re-creates the blood clotting
    physiology, and characteristic blood flow, that happens within the body. With
    DOAC-reversing drugs, the diagnostic can determine DOAC type (Factor Xa or Factor
    IIa), and the level of DOAC in the blood, allowing emergency room physicians to
    make more informed care decisions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of viral transmission of the novel coronavirus
    (SARS-CoV-2) and other viral pathogens. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has killed
    hundreds of thousands with widespread disruption to economic and healthcare systems.
    Face masks have been shown to play a critical role in reducing coronavirus transmission.
    However, cloth masks do a poor job protecting the wearer from exposure and effective
    alternatives (i.e., N95 respirators) are in short supply for front-line workers
    and the public, creating an urgent need for a low-cost, safe, effective, and simple
    coating technology that reduces virus transmission. This project will develop
    a coating that can be applied directly to a face mask or mask insert.  Beyond
    COVID-19, future coating compositions could be tuned to address new viral outbreaks.
    Furthermore, respiratory protection via coatings or filter inserts are likely
    to be in high demand given the increased awareness from the current crisis. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop molecular coatings with amphoteric properties
    to enhance virus adsorption from water-based aerosols. Ion exchange (IEX) materials
    are commonly used in aqueous environments as effective virus adsorbents because
    of pH tunable electrostatic affinity. However, these design principles have not
    been translated to a face mask coating because commercially available IEX materials:
    1) utilize hazardous chemicals that require complex and centralized production,
    2) lack tunability for adsorption in a fixed pH environment (i.e., human breath),
    and 3) typically absorb water which is detrimental to the respiratory protection
    of a mask. This project will overcome these limitations through the design of
    a heterogeneous surface coating. The coating composition will be optimized to
    promote electrostatic virus adsorption under breathing conditions (i.e., pH ~
    7.7) while simultaneously enhancing hydrophobicity to minimize aerosol penetration
    through a porous mask. The key technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research
    are: 1) formation of a single phase coating solution, 2) coating application and
    optimization of amphoteric properties for selective adsorption, 3) achieving an
    increase viral protection factor of 2× or higher, and 4) assessing cradle-to-grave
    safety.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    is to improve detection and diagnosis of cancer in women with dense breasts, a
    significant fraction of the 40 million women screened annually. Women with dense
    breasts are at greater risk for low cancer detection and overdiagnosis of disease.
    This risk arises from limitations in the x-ray imaging techniques currently available
    to them: mammography, tomosynthesis and breast CT. The proposed technology utilizes
    the benefits of CT imaging science - advantageous over mammography and tomosynthesis
    - while incorporating innovations in CT image acquisition. The technology will
    deliver high quality three-dimensional images of the breast providing high visibility
    of microcalcifications (small traces of cancer) at radiation levels on par with
    existing breast cancer screening standards.  This technology has the potential
    to reduce the financial burdens of misdiagnosis without introducing new risks
    to the patient. \n\nThe proposed project initiates development of a new form of
    tomographic breast imaging, built upon the discovery that scatter-free x-ray images
    result in improved visibility of small microcalcifications. The proposed design
    overcomes limitations of mammography and tomosynthesis - primarily the masking
    of cancer by healthy tissue - and limitations of existing breast CT that include
    poor microcalcification visibility, limited posterior breast anatomy coverage,
    and inadequate image quality at screening dose levels. The proposed CT design
    minimizes dose exposure to the patient and delivers acquired raw data that are
    near scatter-free. These improvements result in higher quality images with greater
    microcalcification visibility. The overarching objective of this SBIR Phase 1
    project is to build a prototype for improved study and simulation. In the first
    stage of prototype development, a collimator and shielding apparatus will be implemented
    to control scatter and dose. In the second stage, this apparatus will be incorporated
    into an existing, functional breast CT scanner. Performance objectives include
    a reduction in radiation dose to an average-sized breast by as much as 30% over
    existing methods, achievement of near scatter-free image acquisition, and improved
    visibility of small microcalcifications.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    strains, to provide enhanced protective effects against harmful fungi and bacteria,
    with the added benefit of boosting plant health and improving overall crop yield.
    This project will develop new formulations of the blended strain biofungicide

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) project is to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production while optimizing net income to producers. Over-application of nitrogen fertilizer contributes to groundwater contamination via nitrate-nitrogen leaching, and puts substantial financial burden on rural municipalities and private well owners who are required to install and pay for treatment of their drinking water. An estimated 1% of global energy consumption is attributed to the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. Producers operate under tight margins, and face pressure to maximize crop yields to remain profitable and sustain their business. The proposed technology aims to optimize nitrogen application and minimize the susceptibility of loss to the environment, while accounting for the year to year weather variability that poses the largest production challenge. The technology not only determines the optimum nitrogen rate for achieving maximum profit, but it also provides transparency in nitrogen management and can serve as a means for demonstrating compliance with incentive or regulatory programs.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to refine and test a novel algorithm for making real-time nitrogen fertilizer recommendations during the growing season using remote sensing. The need for this technology is rooted in the issue that producers are not satisfied with current methods for in-season nitrogen management because of lack of accuracy and poor temporal and spatial resolution. The research objectives of this project are to: (i) predict crop nitrogen concentration using multispectral information, (ii) compare the algorithm to conventional methods, (iii) calibrate and validate a crop growth model for prediction of above-ground biomass, (iv) develop predictive algorithms for radiation use efficiency, and (v) optimize the algorithm and develop a software application suitable for use by producers. The algorithm needs to account for yearly variability in crop growth dynamics caused by climatic conditions, crop variety, and nitrogen management practices. A field experiment will be conducted to collect data necessary to evaluate these objectives. It is anticipated that this technology will perform with reasonable accuracy and have similar or superior performance to existing N management methods, making it a vast improvement over current practices because of its ability to consider spatial and temporal variability in a scalable manner.

In addition to replacing chemical disinfectants, plasma activated water could prove to be fast enough to allow for disinfecting the milking unit in-between individual cows, which should reduce the spread of mastitis within a herd, reducing the farmer's costs in terms of medicine, increased labor, and culling. By using plasma activated water as part of a milking system, cleaning could be automated as well as target spores in farm environments. The resulting reduction in costs, infection rate, manual labor & strain, and increase in milk quality, could revolutionize the dairy industry.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to research a method whereby plasma activated water replaces chemical disinfectants used in dairy milking machines. The dairy industry is facing two major problems relating to milking machines: first, a manual labor shortage, and secondly an ever-present threat of mastitis, an infection estimated to cost the industry $1B annually. These two problems come to a head at the milking machine, as current methods require cows to be manually cleaned before milking. The goal of this project is to explore whether plasma activated water could be an effective replacement for teat dips, aiming to design a self-cleaning milking attachment for existing machines, and clean the cows with PAW prior to milking. In Phase I, the focus will be on building a basic prototype to check sanitation capabilities, and compatibility with a farm environment. Future research would include a longer-term study of animals and track infection rates before and after.

    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project entails developing an novel drug delivery platform
    to deliver drug into poorly accessible druggable targets. Drugs targeting inflammation
    are encapsulated in an new way for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases
    such as psoriasis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis. Biological therapies remain the
    standard for autoimmune diseases, but patients can have immune system problems
    due to the production of autoantibodies. This project addresses this challenge
    with a novel encapsulation technology that delivers biological therapies to hard-to-reach
    inflammation sites. This technology could be advantageous because it reduces immunosuppression
    and anti-drug antibodies production. This project will improve patient treatment
    outcomes and reduce treatment reduce cost. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will test a proof-of-concept that entails demonstrating
    that an exosome-based delivery vehicle for biologics will potentially inhibit
    inappropriate TLR-driven inflammation. Induction of autoimmune diseases including
    psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus strongly correlate with chronic inflammation
    driven by inflammatory signaling pathways mediated by endosomal TLRs. Our goal
    is to develop an exosome-based therapy that can inhibit poorly accessible endosomal
    TLR7-driven inflammation. To test this concept, our plan involves genetically
    modifying human cell lines to produce engineered exosomes that contain anti-TLR7
    antibody to inhibit endosomal TLR7-driven inflammation. We will develop a drug
    encapsulation platform in which engineered exosomes bear an anti-TLR7 antibody
    fused with an exosome transmembrane protein called tetraspanin. This complex delivers
    an antibody payload to TLR7 targets located in on endosomal membrane inner surface.
    This anti-TLR7 antibody will bind to dimer-interfaces of TLR7 monomer and thereby
    block TLR7 receptor dimerization, which in turn blocks proinflammatory signaling.
    This work is important because blocking TLR7 receptor activation, which is situated
    upstream in the signaling cascade, will presumably diminish immunosuppression
    and lead to a better outcome that current anti-TNF therapies that are more broad
    spectrum because their site of action is downstream in a signaling pathway axis.\n\nThis

    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will target clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    (MRI) scanners where there is limited MRI access to a larger patient population.
    \ Enhanced spatial resolution and reduced scan time are in urgent demand for investigating
    a comprehensive range of biological systems from single cells to humans.  Long
    scan times reduce the efficiency of radiology department processes and increase
    the overall cost to clinics and patients. In the research community, high-resolution
    MRI is a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity.  This project will
    pioneer an entirely different solution to the fundamental problem of long scan

    imaging modality for radiology and one of the most powerful research instruments
    for life science. However, it has an inherently low signal-to-noise ratio, limiting
    both imaging resolution and scan speed.  Development efforts will focus on incorporation
    of high permittivity dielectric materials into MRI scanners to increase the signal-to-noise
    ratio by over 40%, thereby cutting the scan time by half.  The dielectric materials

    be synthesized and incorporated into clinical 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners.   Oxide
    materials with the optimized dielectric properties will be synthesized and characterized

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to new educational software for learning human anatomy.  The software will serve 54,000 healthcare professional students studying anatomy each year in the U.S., as well as 450,000 undergraduate students.  Anatomy is the cornerstone of medical education with cadaver dissection serving as the gold standard teaching method. However, many students have limited or no access to cadavers during their academic experience.  Learning resources in human anatomy (textbooks, models, apps) are generally color-coded, computer-generated images that lack the complexities and appearance of cadavers. These learning materials do not match dissected specimens, making knowledge transfer more difficult.  To overcome these challenges, the proposed software will marry digital cadaveric models with captivating educational gaming strategies. The software will bring high-quality anatomy education to low resource settings in the U.S. and abroad.

    The proposed project will incorporate principles of educational psychology and learning science to develop a gaming platform for healthcare professional students (e.g. medical, physical therapy, dental, physician assistant) to learn human anatomy. The games will be built on a virtual atlas of human anatomy created from high-resolution images of dissected human cadavers. For this proof-of-feasibility project, we will focus on the human heart. Technical hurdles to this project include incorporating learning principles into the games and converting anatomy images into a software package that can run on devices, such as iPads and smartphones, while maintaining resolution and usability features. During this project, we will capture images of the human heart, transfer them into the appropriate software development platform, and then add education features and games in an iterative process.

    Phase I project is to alleviate the suffering caused by hyper-inflammation.  Hyper-inflammation
    is a mis-regulation of the immune system often brought on by viral pneumonia.
    It can have severe life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory
    distress syndrome (ARDS) and changes in blood clotting; hyper-inflammation has
    been seen in COVID-19 patients. Secondary conditions caused by hyper-inflammation
    can also have severe long-term consequences to patient health. This project will
    develop therapeutics that quiet the systemic mis-regulation of the immune system
    and reduce patient mortality. \n\nThe proposed project will advance a treatment
    for hyper-inflammation, such as that induced by COVID-19. It arises from multiple
    stimuli and results in life-threatening mis-regulation of the immune system. With
    a novel molecular target, a new class of anti-fibrotic compounds have the potential
    to reduce cytokine levels and pro-coagulation factors, acting broadly to address
    the heterogeneity of inflammation responses. As information becomes available
    regarding the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19, relevant biomarkers have been
    proposed.  To demonstrate robust actions on inflammation this project will evaluate
    the effects of the therapeutic on 1) pro-inflammatory cytokine release, 2) activation
    of the innate immune system, and 3) systemic concentrations of cytokines and pro-coagulation
    factors after initiation of inflammation. Biomarkers will be established to track
    the efficacy of the therapeutic at early and late stages of inflammation, providing
    a strong rationale for testing the efficacy of this class of compounds in animal
    models of inflammation. Importantly, with the successful completion of this project,
    this class of therapeutics will have demonstrated potential to treat hyper-inflammation,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improved food security, environmental benefits, and human health benefits.  This project will develop a meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meat.  The technology developed from the proposed project will be used to build a vertically integrated food manufacturing platform that can withstand supply chain disruptions from natural disasters and pandemics. These meat alternatives will reduce and replace traditional meat consumption, with many environmental benefits - lowered greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic pollution; lower use of energy, water and land; and reduced antibiotics usage. There are benefits to human health for reduced meat consumption. Furthermore, production costs will be eventually be comparable to that of mushroom farming.

    The proposed project aims to develop a fermentation-based meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meal through recombinant protein technologies.  Additionally, the project aims to leverage the texture and flavor of mushroom mycelia, and supplement this with recombinant muscle proteins to further enhance the taste and nutritional profiles and overcome many of the shortcomings of existing plant-based meat products. To date the concept of combining recombinant muscle protein and single cell protein is novel and has not been reported. Large gaps persist between plant-based and lab-grown meat, with regards to cost and consumer experience. Plant-based meat is more affordable but faces consumer resistance due to sub-optimal texture and nutritional profiles, while cultivated meat offers a consumer experience similar to that of animal meat but at a much higher cost. Towards this goal, muscle protein genes will be expressed in a microbial host and enzymatically cross-linked with vegetable protein to produce protein fibers that can be formulated into synthetic meat. The technical objectives also include demonstration the feasibility of crosslinking muscle fiber proteins extracted from meat with mycoprotein from mushroom to produce desired textural and flavor properties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from development of a safe and sustainable anti-viral treatment for COVID-19. Vaccine and drug development efforts are underway, but the efficacy of these treatments and their safety particularly for high-risk populations remain a concern. The proposed project is an anti-viral inhaler that delivers a natural immune defense salivary protein that blocks the activity of a molecule essential for viral replication in the lung. The candidate therapeutic will potentially be a safer treatment option for people with compromised health. The sustainability of this treatment relies on three factors. First, the therapeutic targets a viral genome replication process. Thus, this targeted technology will not be compromised by virus mutations and will maintain its efficacy against current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Second, it does not require clinical administration and is thus more easily accessible by patients. Third, the treatment has potential as an broad anti-viral therapy.

    The proposed project will validate a novel anti-viral treatment against SARS-CoV-2.  First, the anti-viral action will be validated in a cell-based model that mimics human lung infected with coronavirus, alveolar epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Next, an in vivo model will be used to confirm that the therapy can reach the virus target site in the lung, undergo uptake by the alveolar epithelial cells and avoid the barriers of pulmonary delivery (e.g. mucus, pulmonary enzymes or macrophages). Finally, this project will confirm that the therapy does not elicit a pro-inflammatory response and toxicity in lung cells, so it can be safely given to people with compromised health without exacerbating their immune response. The treatment will be delivered by inhalation and ultimately become a therapeutic and prophylactic anti-viral inhaler.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to improve current digital microscope imaging technology to
    produce better images and video of biological phenomena. Current microscopes are
    limited by a tradeoff between image resolution, viewing area and video frame rate,
    which presents a bottleneck in many imaging experiments. For example, current
    microscopes cannot observe model organisms such as the zebrafish and fruit fly
    at cellular detail during free movement. By simultaneously capturing high-speed,
    high-resolution video over a large viewing area, this proposal’s new microscope
    will overcome the limitations of standard microscopes to allow scientists to make
    new discoveries surrounding fundamental behaviors.It will also dramatically increase
    the speed and scope of current high-content screening experiments that observe
    many organisms at high-resolution in parallel, and will also open  new applications
    in high-throughput industrial inspection. \n\nThe proposed project will address
    the limited throughput challenges faced by current microscopes by adopting a novel
    parallelized imaging strategy. To overcome current trade-offs between image resolution,
    field-of-view and frame rate, the project’s first research objective is to develop
    a new type of microscope consisting of an array of micro-cameras simultaneously
    observing a large viewing area at high resolution and high speed. Synchronized
    image data captured by 54 micro-cameras, arranged in a 9x6 array, will be digitally
    combined via novel software into 100 megapixel-per-frame video at 100 frames per
    second. The resulting video stream will contain 10-100X more pixels per frame
    than any other high-speed image sensor currently on the market. The project’s
    second research objective is to create software that can efficiently process the
    large amount of resulting image data to enable efficient storage and analysis.
    The software’s first specific goal is to track, crop and analyze video data of
    multiple freely moving organisms to extract key behavioral statistics (e.g., position,
    orientation, body length/curvature). The project’s third research objective is
    to test and verify the new imaging hardware and software in a series of biological
    experiments monitoring the high-speed behavior of Drosophila Melanogaster.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to develop a first-in-kind therapeutic for treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as well as potentially other severe respiratory conditions that are characterized by high rates of mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization time. ARDS causes deactivation of the lungs’ surfactant, which is responsible for keeping the lung structure inflated and dry. This causes inadequate blood oxygenation and mutli-organ failure without invasive mechanical ventilation. ARDS is believed to account for 7% of the world’s ICU beds and can be caused by many root causes, including both direct lung injuries (i.e. bacterial/viral pneumonia) and indirect lung injuries (i.e. trauma). In the case of the pandemic, current data suggests that 14% of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization. Of these patients, 1 in 3 will develop ARDS, reducing their chance of survival to 60%. In a normal year there are 3 million ARDS cases globally (220k US) that are highly resource intensive (avg. $82k treatment cost), which presents a considerable financial burden on patients and healthcare systems. A therapeutic treatment would reduce patient deaths and frequency of chronic complications.

    The proposed project will develop a different approach to ARDS treatment via a synthetic Polymer Lung Surfactant (PLS) technology. This PLS technology overcomes shortcomings of previously attempted therapies as it is engineered to be safely used in the body, highly surface-active (lower surface tension), water-soluble (prepared in injectable aqueous suspension), and resistant to protein deactivation. Suspended in solution, PLS is evenly distributed in the lungs of mechanically ventilated patients. When PLS reaches the alveoli, it forms a gas-permeable micelle monolayer that mimics the function of human lung surfactant without being deactivated.  Doing so re-inflates the alveoli while reducing fluid accumulation and inflammation so that blood oxygenation can be restored. Building upon promising PLS safety/efficacy proof-of-concept data, specific aim #1 of this project will optimize delivery parameters in mice that have been induced with ARDS by differing root causes (infection vs. acid-aspiration). Specific aim #2 will use iodine-labeled PLS to generate distribution and clearance data in mice from delivery to several days post-treatment. This data will be used to optimize key delivery and PLS parameters to ensure that maximum efficacy is sustained for several days.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the potential elimination of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). GVHD is a devastating illness that afflicts transplant recipients who are recovering from chemotherapy and who suffer from suppression of their bone marrow function and immune system. GVHD associated illnesses lead to a very high rate of premature death in these patients. This project focuses on the development of a novel biocomputational platform to generate patient-derived stem cells to be subsequently reintroduced to the same cancer patient. This completely bypasses third-party bone marrow and blood donations, decreasing, and potentially eliminating, lethal GVHD and drastically improving outcomes. The use of cells derived directly from the same patient (e.g. skin cells) to reconstitute the blood system is considered one of the highest and most challenging goals of blood system regenerative biology research. This will advance bioinformatics and cell therapy research and will advance the state-of-the-art in cancer treatment and personalized medicine.

    The proposed project will use a high-fidelity prototype computational tool to generate transcription factor recipes for cellular transdifferentiation, test those predicted recipes through systematic and high-throughput wetlab validations, and demonstrate proof of concept for the autologous production of persistent HSCs that maintain long-term multilineage engraftment and self-renewal, potentially enabling recapitulation of the entire blood lineage. The project scope includes an effort to survey, identify, and procure appropriate initial cell types; determine cell type-specific predictions for reprogramming into HSCs; prioritize the most promising recipes and carry out appropriate viral transductions; create an in vitro analog of target HSCs and determine alignment with the human HSC phenotype; and perform reprogramming experiments for the top transcription factor recipes. Data analysis will include key comparisons of reprogrammed HSCs, in vitro analog HSCs, primary human HSCs, and data from prior published efforts to produce HSCs. HSCs are fundamentally different from the differentiated cell types previously targeted with the computational tool, as they retain proliferative potential and are therefore very difficult to generate. Proof of concept in this challenging system will not only address GVHD, but also further prove the efficacy of the overall biocomputational platform for use in numerous other biological systems and potential cures.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide a therapeutic solution for coronavirus pandemics.  Coronaviruses have been implicated in several outbreaks, including prior SARS and MERS. The proposed therapeutic will inhibit the virus’s ability to replicate and elicit the body's immune system to kill the virus.  In addition, this research can be applied to solutions for other viruses including RSV, hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS.

    The proposed project will advance a method integrating vaccines, small molecule inhibitors, and antibodies. This project will identify a small molecule that targets and binds to the virus, then link it to a small payload that signals the body's immune system.  This project will identify and develop a targeting molecule that can bind effectively to multiple strains of the coronavirus and a payload that promotes an appropriate immune response.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to improve strength and stiffness of carbon fiber reinforced composites in aerospace, automotive, energy, and other applications. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials are used to reduce weight without compromising the strength of structural components, but because they are built layer by layer, they have certain weaknesses.  This project will advance a new approach to to enable production of higher performance automobiles, airplanes, turbines and more. The process can be highly automated, cost-effective, and seamlessly integrated with existing CFRP manufacturing. This can be integrated into existing processes. The continued development of stronger and lighter composite parts will also have an impact in related fields including renewable energy resources.  The technology holds the promise of reducing operating costs, improving fuel efficiency, and decreasing emissions. This will lead to significant impacts on national security in advanced manufacturing.

    The strong technical innovation in the project is identifying the use of electrospinning to coat a prepreg CFRP roll with carbon nanotube (CNT)/epoxy nanofilaments that can form a CNT-reinforced bonding surface that is square meters in area and just tens of microns in thickness. This project will address the longstanding weak through-thickness interlaminar strength of CFRP prepreg laminates using a low materials-cost and highly automated process. The project will expand on the primary innovation to develop a theoretical understanding of multiscale nanoscaffold-enhanced CFRP advanced composites through genetic algorithm assisted machine learning (GAML) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The objective is to establish an experimentally and computationally supported GAML framework for determining optimal processing parameters and structural features. Results will lead to better optimization tools in the design of new composite materials, and the development of instrumentation supporting the emergence of new weight and cost saving opportunities in the composite industry for complex systems.

    Phase I project is to develop the first small RNA-based vaccination approach for

    most devastating bacterial diseases. XF diseases include (1) Olive Quick Decline
    Syndrome, which is currently threatening the entire Southern Europe olive industry
    and killing trees that are over 1,000 years old; (2) Pierce’s Disease, which has
    severely damaged Southern California vineyards; and (3) Citrus Variegated Chlorosis,

    can systemically infect all commercial varieties of citrus, can also systemically
    infect olive trees and/or grapevines; (4) amplify the RNA vector in trees susceptible

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new rapidly dry-sanitizing technology for disposable single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) and other articles in a manner that preserves material integrity and function to enable multiuse during pandemic and post-pandemic times. It will promote energy and water conservation, and reduce plastic waste significantly. This ozone-based sanitization technology will benefit all frontline workers regularly exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The need for rapid sterilization technology is likely to grow to mitigate social distancing configurations. Schools, daycare centers, health and fitness facilities, factories, and airports will need to implement sterilization protocols. With this technology, clothes, face shields and masks, phones, smart devices, and all manner of personal articles can be easily sanitized in less than ten minutes. The market for small industrial-scale waterless appliances with the capacity to offer on-demand sterilization may also expand rapidly. While ozone is used in a wide range of sterilization technologies, there is currently no consumer-friendly dry washing machine.  Thus, this project may also support development of an eco-friendly and effective laundry solution. Together, the sanitization and safety tasks will advance this technology as a viable waterless sanitization device, with the distinct advantage of lower cost, compact size, operational ease, and accessibility.

    The proposed project advances translation of a low-cost, rapidly deployable gas-based field sanitizer that does not require water, solvents, or detergents. To combat infectious viruses and odor-causing bacteria, this technology must meet aggressive benchmarks set by federal regulatory agencies for ozone emissions while achieving the highest bioburden reduction levels short of an autoclave. This project will optimize the ozone dose (ppm and time of exposure) required for viral inactivation and testing mask fit and filtration efficiency after repeated exposure to high ozone concentrations. The device will also incorporate new containment and neutralization technologies to meet environmental safety requirements. The device performance will be characterized by monitoring the exhaust for residual ozone during and after operation.

    on each child’s development and be able to provide better support in the remote
    context. Moreover, families will have access to high-quality, low-touch resources
    to support their child at home, even if the classrooms are closed.  \n\nThe proposed
    project is developing an early childhood teacher and family engagement tool to
    support remote enrichment for young children at home. The approach brings together
    the organization’s game-based assessment system to support teachers in the classroom
    with the organization’s research-based learning games for children. This project
    will make its assessment product accessible within a home context. Parents and
    caregivers will be able to use their smartphones or tablets to collect assessment
    data. Research will be conducted to ascertain ease of use and fidelity of assessment
    data collected in a remote context.  This data will then be used to power recommendations
    on the organization’s research-based games, two of which will be developed through
    this work, as well as other educational resources that families and children can
    do together. Assessment data is typically collected by teachers through an observation-based
    approach in the classroom; this project will enable parents and caregivers to
    collect assessment data pertaining to school readiness at home through touchscreen
    games. Early childhood teachers will then be able to use the data from the assessment
    and learning products to guide their remote instructional plans.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Facilitating Early Childhood Teacher and Family Engagement
    During COVID-19'
- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase
    I project includes the need for 1) student engagement in social-emotional learning,
    2) coordinated and consistent ways for counselors, teachers, and students to support
    the mental health of students, and 3) student connection during times of isolation.
    The transition from elementary to middle school demands new social skills in a
    larger and more intricate environment with an increased probability of peer conflicts.
    Paradoxically, this point also marks a need for more stable and intimate relationships
    with peers. In other words, the point of highest need with respect to relationships
    coincides with opportunities for the most turmoil. All of these challenges now
    exist in parallel with COVID-19, which has caused school closings, food scarcity,
    parental unemployment, social isolation, and destabilized support systems. The
    project will develop a scalable tool for supporting teachers, counselors and after
    school/out of school facilitators engaging students in social-emotional learning.
    Within the web-based system, students will be able to actively and consistently
    track and reflect upon their thoughts, feelings, and emotions; teachers/counselors
    will have a dashboard with a view of students’ challenges and customized suggestions
    for students to engage with social-emotional learning activities. \n\nThe proposed
    project will develop an intelligent online self-tracking system to support social-emotional
    growth for middle school students. The key technical challenges we must resolve
    include: defining and refining a user experience that teachers/counselors will
    find educationally compelling and with which learners will engage; designing a
    curating process for remote learning content that will ensure safety and security
    of all users; designing algorithms to support tracking of student social-emotional
    well-being; and creating a recommendation system that determines the best interventions
    to suggest to students based on previous interactions.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    Phase I project is in promoting insect protein as an alternative source of protein
    for animal feed with a considerably lower environmental footprint compared to
    soy and fishmeal. With over 40% of food produced in the U.S today wasted and a
    potential $162 billion in annual loss related to waste, the proposed technology
    leverages the bioconversion potential of the non-pestiferous, voracious black

    protein-rich, high-fat insect biomass suitable for animal feed.  \n \nThe proposed
    project will explore dynamics related to generation of larval products in animal
    feed.  The project will untangle the dynamics controlling depletion of resources
    and heat exchange underpinning the insect-substrate-microbial complex within bioreactors.
    By leveraging the rapid turnover in insect generation time and applying Genomic
    Selection, the project will improve many economically relevant traits in BSFL,
    enhance bioconversion rates, and make the larvae more robust to thrive with a
    variety of waste feedstock materials. Similarly, by developing a proprietary bioreactor
    design to solve the challenges associated with heat exchange and oxygenation of
    colonies posed by traditional rearing systems and optimizing environmental conditions
    (heat, oxygen, and moisture) during larvae growth, the project will inhibit lethal
    conditions and permit a significantly higher stocking density. Overall, the main
    sustainability objective is to upcycle agricultural by-products that may contain
    toxic or undesired compounds. This project will assess the fate of pollutants

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in making US manufacturing base more competitive. The aerospace supply chain contains thousands of less digitally sophisticated Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) manufacturers. The SMEs constitute a vast aerospace supply base across the country and have largely remained unaffected by the advances in operations research. Consequently, local manufacturers compete unfavorably with those in low-cost countries. While the computing power and speed of optimization techniques have increased to a point where one could now solve large-scale industry problems in real time, little attention has been given to the many modeling decisions that need to be made to accurately capture the complexities of real factory physics into a prescriptive mathematical model.  This project will develop of a plug-and-play software for SMEs this estimated $850 M market that will improve efficiency along the entire supply chain. The resulting solution is expected to be a production optimizer that can be implemented in less than two weeks at any SME aerospace manufacturer using their existing data streams.  Use of digital technologies and operations research advances embodied in this project will ultimately play an appreciable role in bringing outsourced manufacturing back to the United States.

    The proposed project will advance translation of powerful optimization tools in production planning and execution. The proposed contributions include 1) a hierarchical approach that allows for planning and scheduling at different timescales, 2)  computational improvements to classic operations models to incorporate real-time issues such as incomplete orders, carryover of production and continuation of setup activities across periods, 3) the design of algorithms to adapt the shop’s data to the different timescales while preserving model accuracy, 4) the analysis of the impact of planning horizon, time period choice and objective coefficients, as well as the creation of systematic schemes to determine their best value to meet user needs, and 5) the development of heuristics for quick re-optimization to respond to small deviations from the plan.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is an enabling technology to improve research into many diseases.  This STTR project will develop human matrix metalloprotease (MMPs), a class of enzymes that degrade many biomolecules including collagen, the most abundant structural protein in the human body. MMPs are critical for numerous normal and pathological processes, such as tumor growth. However, MMPs are expensive to produce, and researchers need a reliable source of well-characterized human MMPs so that researchers can pursue high quality, reliable experiments on basic science and medical applications. Furthermore, this project can impact other fields that use enzymes, such as the food industry, renewable energy, and human health.

    The proposed project will commercialize inexpensive recombinant human MMPs produced in E. coli. MMPs degrade and regulate various structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), impacting pathologies such as metastasis of solid tumors, which cannot occur without MMP-mediated degradation of collagens. Recombinant MMPs can support this research.  This STTR project will advance development of protease-based protein purification without chromatography, enabling rapid and low-cost purification. The technical R&D tasks include developing technical assessments for MMPs. The technical assessments will contain raw and curated data for purity, identity, concentration, and activity of MMPs at different solution conditions. This project will investigate development of MMPs as anti-biofilm and anti-clot agents beyond the traditional collagen degradation field of research. The protease-based method used to obtain MMPs can be used to purify other proteins as well. MMPs also have biotechnological applications in broad-spectrum degradation of tissue components for cell isolation from tissue samples and diseases involving aberrant collagen depositions.

    materials that feature no accompanying support structures, and minimal artifacts
    such as layering from the printing process. This project will achieve printing
    at the focal point of a laser beam. Because this process has substantially reduced

    reduced cost. This technology will support rapid prototyping of ultrahigh resolution
    parts or creation of microelectromechanical systems and will enable widespread
    use. \n\nThis project will build a volumetric 3D printer based on photon upconversion
    nanocapsules. These nanocapsules contain a liquid core of molecules that undergo
    triplet-triplet annihilation to convert red photons to blue photons with a quadratic
    power dependence. When paired with an appropriate photopolymerization scheme that
    is activated by blue light but transparent to red light, these nanocapsules can
    be used to drive polymerization exclusively at the focal point of a red laser.
    The development of larger anti-stokes shifts for the upconversion process, and
    the enhancement of the upconversion efficiency will allow for rapid printing.
    Work optimizing upconversion wavelengths and efficiencies will be achieved using
    photoluminescence spectroscopy. The development of multiplexed optical schemes
    will further enhance the printing speed. Beam profiling will be performed to determine
    the success of light-shaping approaches. Functionalization of the nanocapsules
    will allow them to be made compatible with a broad range of 3D printing resins.
    Development of resins especially suited for this style of 3D printing will further
    differentiate this technology from existing approaches to 3D printing.\n\nThis

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be advanced understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and the human gut microbiome, potentially resulting in new treatment approaches for COVID-19 patients.  This project will develop a novel biosensor to enable low-cost, highly standardized studies of links between the human gut microbiome and COVID-19 to help evaluate the performance of different therapeutic approaches, drugs, vaccines, and other clinical interventions. Finally, once this project is successfully completed, there is a longer-term opportunity to add detection capability to the technology, enabling real-time, at-home tracking of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in stool samples of high-risk patients and their caretakers. This would enable the technology to become a continuous viral detection tool.

    The proposed project will advance a sensor to allow isolation and preservation of microbial RNA from stool samples.  Existing technique preserve microbial DNA but are not sensitive enough to preserve the far less stable RNA. The project will evaluate candidate extraction and fixative reagents based on technical performance, length of RNA stability, reagent cost, and storage requirements. Simultaneously, the project will develop an advanced systems architecture enabling a scalable solution for widespread use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a life-saving treatment option to patients suffering from a specific heart condition called tricuspid regurgitation (TR). In the US, 1.6 million patients need treatment for life-threatening TR, and no good medical, surgical, or transcatheter therapy exists. Current solutions lead to bleeding complications, damage to the circulatory system, or inability to deliver the device. This project will develop a novel device to address these constraints with a method that can be manufactured at scale, resulting in significant cost savings to the healthcare system and improved quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will enable the development of a new transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device and novel technology to produce 3D physical vapor deposition (PVD) nitinol thin-film leaflets. One of the main challenges in valve development is a design that can be compressed into a catheter successfully. The use of a thin film rather than the standard of pericardial tissue will significantly reduce the volume of the valve material, enabling a much smaller delivery catheter profile. This study addresses critical developmental objectives, such as manufacturing feasibility and thin film leaflet characteristics. The solution will be optimized for material fatigue life, valve characteristics, valve durability, and anchoring to validate it for medical use.

    is repaved annually using a free-floating screed invented in 1930.  In the past
    5 years, the paving industry in the US generated an average annual revenue of

    surface problems by applying a thin, variable-thickness lift, integrating color
    designs and striping, and imbedding objects such as sensors and solar panels in
    the pavement. If this process leads to a 20% cost reduction (conservative estimate)

- abstractText: "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will
    develop a novel method for chemical analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance
    (NMR) spectroscopy at moderate and low magnetic field strengths. A major cost
    and physical limitation of NMR spectroscopy is the high-field magnet typically
    required. Although high-field instruments face competition from smaller benchtop-sized
    instruments, now a $120 million segment of the $1.25 billion NMR market, these
    moderate-field devices have lower performance, high cost, and lack portability.
    This project will address these challenges by exploring a new method designed
    to work in weaker, different magnetic fields produced with cheap, light, portable
    magnets. This will bring down the cost and expand the NMR market in a broader
    range of applications in petroleum exploration, refining, and chemical manufacturing;
    and potentially smaller educational institutions such as high schools. \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project is the development of the physical theory behind
    a new form of NMR spectroscopy and its testing in moderate-field benchtop spectrometers,
    as well as in low-field regimes where spectroscopic information is currently impossible
    to acquire. This is made possible by a recently discovered phenomenon called \"spin-lock
    induced crossing\" (SLIC), which measures how the system responds to a small rotating
    magnetic field rather than a strong static field. One goal will be to expand the
    theoretical understanding of SLIC in order to predict and analyze the unconventional
    spectra it produces. Other experimental tasks will include exploring the physical
    specifications necessary for spectrometers to use the technique, evaluating the
    method's performance compared to conventional NMR spectroscopy, creating a dictionary
    of low-field spectra for common chemicals, and developing methods for automatic
    analysis and interpretation of the spectra. The results will be used to develop
    software for implementing the method on current benchtop instruments and will
    also provide a basis for the design and translation of low-field spectrometers
    based solely on these methods.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project encompasses development new coatings for face masks and
    filtration pieces for N95-grade respirators. The outer layer will repel the viral
    particles while the inner layer will adsorb moisture, making the mask comfortable
    for wear and assisting with social distancing compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The coatings are efficient in their function, provide reliable protection, and
    are durable. This technology is also highly promising for applications in other
    types of personal protective equipment such as gowns, drapes, medical aprons,
    as well as coatings on disposable medical devices. Apart from the medical sector,
    this platform has potential advantages for other goods, pharmaceutical formulations,
    and personal care products. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    innovative formulations for deposition of high-performance superhydrophobic and
    superhydrophilic coatings on textile surfaces for personal protective equipment.
    The technical innovation is fabrication of novel dendritic polymer particles with
    extraordinary high surface area and unusually strong adhesivity. The soft dendritic
    colloids are formed when a polymer solution is injected into turbulently sheared
    anti-solvent medium. Random stretching of the polymer solution droplets by the
    turbulent anti-solvent flow causes the polymer to precipitate in the form of soft
    dendritic structures. The critical technical hurdle is scaling manufacturing of
    large volumes of soft dendritic particles with fractal morphology. Technical objectives
    are: 1) develop an efficient liquid-based process for soft dendritic colloids
    fabrication on a bench scale; and 2) characterize textiles coated with the new
    formulations using a series of morphological, filtration efficiency, and breathability
    tests.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a convenient, effective, green and economical disinfection solution for everyday items contaminated with pathogens, specifically SARS-CoV-2. This project will develop a portable, compact, and low-power disinfection product using ozone. The proposed solution will address items otherwise difficult to treat with conventional methods such as wipes, UV exposure, and autoclave. Furthermore, it is free of long-term toxic residuals, with excess ozone converted back to oxygen. This will support the mitigation of social distancing policies and applications include personal protection equipment such as disinfecting masks, gloves, suits, equipment, etc., as well as household items.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a convenient, effective, green and economical disinfection unit, based on Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) generated ozone, to remove pathogen contamination. The solution uses embedded compact plasma reactor systems to generate ozone in-situ from atmospheric air and simultaneously distributing it within the box. This eliminates the need for external gas tanks or mixing agents. The proposed project will advance the Active Plasma Module (APM) - a compact, energy-efficient DBD generation device. Research objectives include testing DBD plasma against SARS CoV-2, determining optimum operating conditions (exposure times, ozone concentrations, surface to volume ratios, input power), and testing disinfection on commonly used materials like fabric, latex, etc. This entails designing DBD reactors for APMs and for their integration in an enclosed system, as well as testing of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation under varying operating conditions. This system is expected to rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 while overcoming limitations of conventional disinfection technologies like high temperatures, material incompatibility and ineffective disinfection of obstructed surfaces.

    Phase I project is to produce a replacement for petroleum-based colors used in

    in these industries are seeking to use natural dyes as a replacement for petroleum-based
    dyes, but have been unable to find a suitable replacement for the color blue.Most
    colors used today are made from petroleum and non-renewable materials that can

    special microbes.  By successfully engineering a stable natural blue dye through
    microbial production, virtually any product produced by the food, cosmetic and

    Phase I project is to create a drug-discovery platform that will screen quickly

    \ The ability to screen for BBB penetration early is needed. An estimated 2% of
    small drug molecules and no large molecules are able to pass into CNS to treat
    neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis and strokes, accounting for 12%
    of total global deaths. Each of these diseases represents a major healthcare cost

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project focuses on the development of a broad-scope technology for advanced geophysical density measurements and the monitoring of fluid fronts based on the passive detection of naturally occurring cosmic rays. The primary application area is in the mining sector where the technology is expected to be able to drive significant efficiency improvements (up to 10%) in the recovery of copper and other metals. These efficiencies could potentially result in a commercial value of close to $1 billion per year in the United States alone. The technology can also be applied to monitoring the stability of dams and levees, a widely recognized ongoing concern, where it can provide significant safety and environmental benefits.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of field-ready instrumentation, and in particular an innovative fit-for-purpose network of cosmic ray detectors that can be easily scaled and reconfigured to cover large or small investigation areas with a customizable spatial resolution at a minimal cost. This project will also demonstrate original data inversion methodologies and function of such methods in the feasibility study.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve and accelerate the development of antibody therapies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibody therapies are in development to target SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but emerging virus mutations may result in resistance and require the development of new therapies. Antibody therapies typically enter the clinic after a year of development or longer, and the medical and economic consequences of this delay are severely felt throughout the world. To reduce the time to produce an antibody against an emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutant, this project develops a computational platform trained using massive experimental datasets to rapidly predict the therapeutic potency. This platform will enable drugs against SARS-CoV-2 mutants to more rapidly reach the clinic, saving thousands of lives.  Moreover, the proposed platform can be utilized to predict therapeutic efficacy against future coronavirus strains unassociated with the COVID-19 pandemic, providing an invaluable tool to fight future pandemics.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using quantitative and library-on-library protein interaction datasets to train machine learning models for predicting antibody binding to novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Existing approaches to build computational predictions for antibody drug development have been limited to few target variants, since datasets with binding measurements against hundreds or thousands of targets are not available. This project involves optimizing and validating a cell-based platform for generating a sufficient quantity and quality of antibody-antigen binding data for training computational models. The platform uses genetically engineered yeast cells and next generation sequencing to link protein interaction strength with cellular mating frequency. To demonstrate feasibility, large multi-chain antibody libraries will be genomically integrated in yeast and enriched for binding to SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. Next, a large network of antibody-antigen interactions will be measured and validated for quantitative accuracy by comparing to biophysical measurements. Finally, the resulting data will be used to train machine learning models and evaluate their predictive power using cross-validation. Training of computational models with sufficient predictive power will demonstrate the feasibility of using quantitative and library-on-library binding data coupled with machine learning to develop a platform for rapid antibody development to a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutant.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is reduced costs of road and highway infrastructure repairs and environmental benefits from the use of a low-cost biodegradable and non-corrosive deicer substitute for salts. Deicing chemicals are applied to roads in winter for safety. Typical salts are highly corrosive to concrete, reinforcing steel, and bridge decks, and hence cause billions of dollars in road repair and infrastructure rehabilitation costs.  Because these salts do not biodegrade, they accumulate in the environment and increase salinity in lakes and ground waters, as well as in water supplies. Acetate-based chemicals are effective deicers with minimal corrosion and environmental effects, but they can be expensive to produce.  This project will repurpose wastes to produce a low-cost deicer for reduced infrastructure costs and enhanced environmental quality.

    The proposed project will provide a new cost-effective low pH bioconversion process for the production of acetic and lactic acids from carbohydrate wastes. There are currently no industrial bioconversion facilities for the production of acetic acid due to the high recovery costs for the sorption or extraction of the acid from the broth at neutral pH. This project will advance bioconversion of sugars at sufficiently low pH values where the product recovery efficiency is high. Acid recovery by adsorption on resins or liquid-liquid extraction is about twelve times more efficient with the proposed process than with anaerobic fermentations that operate at neutral pH. This project will develop a process to utilize abundantly available organic and inorganic wastes in the production of the acetate deicer. Hemicellulose, the second most abundant carbohydrate in nature, is not utilized in ethanol fermentations due to the low efficiency of bioconversion. Hemicellulose hydrolysate will be used as substrate in the proposed process. Continuous fermentations at low pH values will be optimized for high organic acids productivities. Multicomponent adsorption studies will be conducted to optimize the schemes for the recovery of the organic acids from the fermentation broth.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve research in the life sciences. This research often uses confocal and fluorescence imaging technologies to capture high-resolution, high-contrast images of biological samples. However, these methods traditionally require high levels of illuminating light, resulting in damage to tissues, disruption of normal processes like cell division, and competing with the light being measured in the experiment.  The proposed solution will improve the collection of light in these microscopes.  This will allow researchers to minimize damage to samples, thus removing current experimental constraints and enabling the development of new and far-ranging applications on an already powerful research platform. The proposed technology will be useful for disease and pharmaceutical research.

    The proposed project will involve the development of a simple, add-on, mirrored sample chamber unit capable of enhancing confocal microscopy capabilities by substantially increasing microscope fluorescence collection efficiency limits. This will require overcoming design challenges because the use of mirrors to collect and refocus emitted light has rarely been attempted in confocal microscopy. The proposed R&D work includes: 1) sample chamber and mirror design and prototyping, 2) design of mounting hardware and integration with an existing confocal system, and 3) exploration of compatible modalities, including Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy. Completion of the proposed objectives will lead to the development of a device that increases the light collection efficiency beyond the current 40% limit, is compatible with any detection objective, and does not require a separate optical path to the detector.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to increase fuel efficiency in vehicles across every
    segment of transportation by integrating hybrid hydraulic technology. Hybrid hydraulic
    vehicles have better fuel economy than traditional vehicles, and so the commercial
    value proposition is drastic savings on fuel. The initial target market is refuse
    trucks, because they are heavy and have frequent stops and starts, and therefore
    waste haulers can see immediate savings in operational costs. Since many municipal
    trash hauling contracts have integrated fuel surcharges, reduced fuel use will
    also result in immediate savings to cities and communities. The same hybrid hydraulic
    design can then be adapted to other vehicle classes, such as delivery vehicles,
    mail trucks, taxis, semi trucks, and construction equipment. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposes to develop a fuel-efficient hybrid hydraulic refuse truck.
    Hybrid hydraulic technology is not yet commercially successful because of 1) the
    noise/vibration/harshness, and 2) the poor driving characteristics of the vehicle.
    These problems are caused by the hydraulic motor pump (currently quite noisy)
    and the transmission plus control strategy (which exacerbate poor vehicle handling).
    The proposed R&D will use a new motor specifically engineered to be quieter, develop
    a new transmission to reduce friction, and design a control system to improve
    driving quality. A newly available “floating cup” hydraulic motor may finally
    solve stubborn noise and whining issues, while still maintaining performance and
    enabling fuel efficiency, but it has never been validated. The R&D plan is to
    first test the new components, focusing on the floating cup hydraulic motor. Then,
    modeling of the tested components will confirm the expected efficiency gains on
    a typical refuse truck collection route. Finally, a tailored control system and
    detailed design of the mechanical system will validate the driving characteristics
    and economic value proposition.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research an internet-of-things (IoT) platform to automatically learn vehicle energy performance models (VEPMs). VEPMs are used to predict driving range and battery state of health in electric vehicles (EVs) on a per-vehicle, per-driver, per-route basis, and 8-10 times more accurately than today. It is estimated that over $150 billion will be invested in the electric vehicle ecosystem over the next decade. A significant obstacle hindering rapid EV adoption is range anxiety representing user concerns over the achievable distance and where/ when to charge the EV.  Range anxiety can be alleviated by providing EV drivers with contextual intelligence on their realistic driving range and recommended charging strategy, based on travel plans, driving behavior and vehicle model. Increasing EV adoption by consumers reduces transportation system fossil fuel consumption and emissions. As part of this effort, a cloud application programming interface (API) will deliver predictions based on the learned VEPMs; this will also enable energy-aware applications such as eco-routing, eco-cruising, eco-powertrain control, and planning of charging stops, among others, both at the individual vehicle and at the fleet level. Energy-aware applications can increase the overall energy efficiency of electrified fleets.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to advance an IoT architecture to automatically learn VEPMs from real-time vehicle sensor telemetry and other data, such as maps and route topography. The plan is divided into three integrated goals: (1) the building of an IoT framework leveraging physics principles to capture the vehicle motion and powertrain efficiencies, as well as data-driven approaches to capture human factors, and uncertainty in maps and measurements, (2) efforts to address scalability and generalization of the learning in geographical areas with limited data and reduced expert supervision, and (3) the experimental validation of the platform on real-world driving data collected in a set of representative conditions. Statistical learning theory will be merged with predictive control theory using a mix of physics-based and data-driven models in the learning process. Scalability and accuracy will be attained by updating models in real-time using data and sharing models among vehicles of the same manufacturer.

    Transfer (STTR) project is development of a disinfectant spray to curb the transmission

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project are in improving the quality of life of the manufacturing workers, helping U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improving consistency in the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells will reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The proposed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants will perform the low-level tedious tasks. This would allow human operators to collaborate more as a team and thereby improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. alone doing composite fabrication. Most of them face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn leading to longer delivery times. The proposed work will enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, it will enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing reliance on human labor and easily scale production capacity with changes in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.


    The overall goal of the proposed effort is to develop a robotic sanding process for high-mix applications. The technology will enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description, accounting for the uncertainties present in the environment. The robotic tools will reduce cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient execution of sanding project related to the fabrication of composite materials.  A robotic sanding cell will be developed by incorporating appropriate sensors and tools, developing algorithms for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell, and assessing the post-sanding surface quality and the state of the abrasive media. The sanding instrumentation will provide recommendations to the human operator for initiating another robotic sanding pass or changing the abrasive media.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (Phase I) project is to reduce human and environmental health risks posed by Harmful Algae Bloom (HABs) impacts to water resources.  Communities across the nation allocate substantial financial resources to address HABs in their water bodies as HABs can be extremely toxic. However, this ecological problem can be treated as an eco-mining opportunity because HABs are tiny eco-miners that scour, collect, and concentrate excess nutrients in water bodies. The proposed technology is an eco-sensitive mining technology designed to harvest, trap, and permanently remove these HABs, their toxins, and the often ore-grade concentration of nutrients they contain. This project will advance a technology to permanently and sustainably removing the HABs, their toxins and the excess nutrients they contain. As a fully scalable and rapidly deployable, cost-effective technology, it will rapidly resolve HAB impairments and related health risks.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed project is to target HABs, trap them through mechanical filtration, separate them through flotation, and monitor and test the effluent water for toxins. The proposed research is focused on development of remote and automatic operation capabilities to further minimize potential contact with HABs.   The process can be deployed in less than one day to surround and control small or very large areas of HABs, does not require a land-based treatment area, and does not need electricity or high capacity pumping systems to work. It can trap and remove HABs actively or passively.

    Phase I project lies in the development of an innovative universal embolization
    biomaterial for the treatment of aneurysms with the goal of stopping undesired
    blood flow through vessels anywhere in the body. Recent reports estimate aneurysm
    incidence of 6 million in the US alone. The mortality rate for aneurysm rupture
    alone are over 50%; 66% of those who survive a rupture suffer from major disabilities.
    Current benchmark treatments for aneurysms include coil embolization, in which
    trained radiologists push long metal wires with a coiled shape into the vessel
    until they are packed densely to slow and clot blood flow. While treatment options
    exist, most suffer from difficulty in administration, high treatment failure rate,
    and high cost. The proposed novel shear-thinning biomaterial (STB) technology

    of optimized STBs and successful delivery. Benchmarks include stoppage of blood
    flow and absence of recanalization within the aneurysm sac in a 60-day follow

    adhesion, and immobility of the material upon exposure to the blood stream, with
    the goal of successful (>95%) exclusion from the circulation up to 60-day post

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to refine clinical injury thresholds of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological diseases. This novel platform is a flexible BBB-based “organ-on-chip” to allow for animal-free testing of cell response and drug treatments for TBI. Organ-on-chips are microfluidic cell culture chips that simulate tissues, organs, or organ systems. In general, improvements in the design and manufacture of organ-on-chips can eventually replace animal models, especially rodent models, as subjects in preclinical drug evaluations. The proposed technology can support future applications in drug development for BBB breakdown, or be used as a platform to test or engineer drugs for transport across the BBB. Finally, the resulting data can be used for modeling transport, injury, and BBB dysfunction.

    The proposed project will advance a novel technology for studying long-term implications of TBI and other neurological diseases. The BBB is a highly selective semipermeable membrane that separates brain tissue and the vascular system, and it can be damaged when trauma disrupts its structural, physiological and functional integrity. However, the role of TBI-mediated mechanics (magnitude, deceleration, impact frequency) on the modulation of BBB structure and function is poorly known.  To date few organ-on-chip models enablee this type of study, and none incorporates TBI as an input variable. The proposed technology provides a TBI-like mechanical insult to the chip’s BBB component, a flexible, porous membrane that separates microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes. The proposed technology can quantify (1) transendothelial electrical resistance across the membrane, (2) BBB permeability, (3) epithelial barrier coefficient, (4) tight junction formation, and (5) cell phenotype, all of which are expected to change during and after TBI. This project will design a more robust electrode system to reproducibly measure transendothelial electrical resistance through micro-dispensing techniques used to 3D-print conductive ink directly onto the BBB membrane.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed work
    will rapidly create new autonomous robots for sanitization in hospitals and other
    high-traffic areas with high risk of surface-borne pathogen transmission. The
    autonomous sanitizing system produced by this effort would fill a crucial void
    in ensuring hospital spaces are kept sanitized as the health care system scrambles
    to respond to the evolving COVID-19 crisis. In addition, the solution will be
    widely applicable in controlling Hospital Acquired Infections, affecting over
    2 million people in the US annually, with an overall economic impact of $45 B.
    \  The proposed autonomous high-dexterity robots are projected to successfully
    keep the high-touch areas in about 10,000 square feet of commercial space reliably
    sanitized and could be applicable to the over 50 billion square feet of public
    commercial space (office, industrial, healthcare, hospitality, retail, etc.) in
    the US.   Faster, more efficient, and targeted santization has potential to dramatically
    reduce downtime of these spaces and the labor required for sanitization.  \n\nThis
    STTR Phase I project, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, will rapidly
    develop new robotic systems and algorithms for robots capable of precisely navigating
    surfaces in crowded environments. This new system will be capable of selective
    sanitization in the proximity of humans, removing the key limitation of existing
    full-room single-source UV radiation based robots requiring the room to be unoccupied.
    UV light technology has tremendous promise in improving sanitization at hospitals
    and reducing costs by minimizing chemical use, but the technology has had limited
    application due to ill effects on mammalian cells. The selective exposure capability
    with the use of the robotic arm and focused lighting will alleviate that limitation,
    opening up further uses of UV lighting in hospital sanitization.  Toward this
    goal, this project will advance key areas of robotics, including Simultaneous
    Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in the presence of dynamic obstacles,
    and the control of arms over surfaces with varied objects and in the vicinity
    of humans. These efforts will advance the science and practice of robotics for
    applications in healthcare and other industries.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat arthritis in joints. This project will advance the use of special materials for joint repair, which permit devices to mimic the naturally soft tissues of the body and provide anatomically correct support. These materials also offer the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, development of patient-specific devices. It will offer the ability to arthritis in joints in the foot, hand, knee (e.g. total knee replacement), spine (e.g. total disc replacement), and repair of any load-bearing orthopedic tissue, such as meniscus.

    The proposed project focuses on advancing the translation of Liquid-Crystalline Elastomers (LCE) as a cartilage replacement device for the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint to treat hallux rigidus. Hallux rigidus is a joint disorder at the base of the big toe. This project will be the first to investigate LCEs for orthopedic applications and develop an MTP joint repair using LCEs. LCEs have vastly superior energy dissipation properties relative to traditional elastomers, such as silicone or hydrogels. This project will demonstrate LCEs for treatment of degenerated joints by drawing from the disciplines of liquid-crystal elastomer science, viscoelasticity, and bioengineering. LCEs are known for behavior that is similar to biological tissues. This proposed project will accomplish: 1) synthesizing an LCE to mimic mechanical properties of natural joint to minimize wear rate under simulated physiological conditions; and 2) validation of biomechanical performance and biocompatibility of LCEs in comparison to the state of practice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to advance the development of reusable vehicles for space. Current space launch solutions use multi-million-dollar rockets discarded after a single use, increasing launch costs and limiting availability. Even the best solutions reuse only a portion of the rocket a handful of times, resulting in launch costs of $5,000/kg and higher. Rockets offering 100% reusability and operating like aircraft reduce cost, availability concerns, and service potential of space launch vehicles. The proposed technology advances reusable space launch vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology enabling space launch vehicles to re-enter the atmosphere and land propulsively at a target destination for reuse. Importantly, robust design solutions are proposed so that extensive refurbishment efforts are not required. Technical challenges include the combination of high-efficiency propulsion, rigorous thermal protection, and low structural mass needed to complete in-space mission objectives. This research investigates a new technical solution combining fundamental vehicle performance with system-level efficiencies to enable reusable second-stage vehicle designs. The optimization parameters include environmental conditions, energy balance, performance predictions, component sizing, and mechanical design elements.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a grid-scale battery to enable large-scale

    from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar. US grid storage capacity
    today is less than 0.01% of daily generation, 95% of which is geographically-limited
    pumped hydroelectric storage technology that is already installed where possible.
    The demand for new grid-level energy storage is seen in the growing use of portable

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project supports the development of a medical device that enables minimally invasive graft-based reconstruction of the urethra as a long-lasting treatment for male urethral stricture, a class of conditions causing restrictions in flow. Approximately 1% of men on Medicare are treated for stricture annually, and an estimated 1 in 5 men will get a stricture in their lifetime. A urethral stricture progressively narrows the urethra - leading to urinary urgency, frequent and painful urination, and impaired intimacy. The current state of practice has many challenges:  Widely available endoscopic treatment is simple and minimally invasive but rarely curative, with high recurrence rates, and repeated endoscopic intervention worsens the stricture and turns a curable condition into a chronic disease, with devastating consequences to quality of life. Graft-based urethral reconstruction has excellent long-term outcomes but limited availability – as the complex open surgery is performed by a select group of reconstructive urologists. The proposed medical device simplifies minimally invasive graft-based urethral reconstruction to empower general urologists to deliver minimally invasive curative treatment.

    The proposed project focuses on demonstrating the anti-migration properties of a temporary indwelling urethral device prototype. The device is designed to deliver a graft to a urethral graft bed, and hold it in place as the graft adheres over a period of 14 days without migrating. Proof-of-concept studies of the mechanically functional prototype will be performed on the bench and in vivo, to be further advanced by integrating proprietary anti-migration features. Key milestones include the prototype's ability to meet: targeted biocompatibility/cytotoxicity benchmarks, anti-migration benchmarks using an in vitro model, and an absence of significant migration in vivo over a 14-day period.

    Phase I project is the determination of the most accurate method of measuring
    protein abundance in patient samples. The answers obtained will address a fatal
    neonatal gut disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, that disproportionately affects
    African-American preterm infants and lacks disease-modifying treatments. The proposed
    technology will serve as a clinically-deployable diagnostic for hospitals, reference
    labs, and drug companies, particularly high-acuity neonatal intensive care units.

    \ Current clinical practice exploits only a single type of mutation that gives
    rise to disease; rarely do they address a target protein with extensive polymorphic

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will reduce the energy demands of district cooling (DC) plants via state-of-the-art monitoring and analysis of system operations. District cooling systems are a more efficient, cost-effective way to produce chilled water across campuses compared to traditional building air conditioning units. Fouling accumulation in DC systems is an inevitable byproduct of environment, water source, and operating conditions; it contributes to inefficiencies that lead to increased power costs. This project’s aim is to improve the understanding and analysis of fouling using a machine learning, algorithm-based system performance indicator (SPI) in conjunction with a nanomaterial that reduces fouling accumulation and improves heat transfer. The SPI will provide value to DC operators by enabling them to be proactive instead of reactive in their maintenance protocols, which will improve the efficiency of their cooling systems and reduce their operating costs. Together, this innovative technology package will optimize DC operations and contribute to reduced energy demand and emissions. An average size DC plant can realize an estimated savings of $300,000 annually.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the efficiency of district cooling (DC) systems by increasing their system analysis capabilities through the following activities: 1) Integrate machine learning techniques into DC system data analysis to generate a system performance indicator (SPI). Instead of signaling that fouling has already occurred, the SPI will predict fouling onset to signal the need for retreatment with the nanomaterial and conduct other maintenance.  2) Optimize a system by integrating additional sensors for system performance diagnostics. The proposed project will conduct verification and validation for a system that could retrofit a single diagnostic sensor in the absence of a full sensor suite.

    Phase I project is to develop environmentally sustainable, higher yielding, pest-resistant
    biotech crops. Crops of the future need dozens of traits to achieve higher yields
    and protect themselves against insects, pests, diseases and changing environmental
    conditions.  The proposed technology will enable efficient production of crops
    engineered with multiple trait genes, higher efficacy of the desired traits, and
    faster breeding and seed production to accelerate distribution. Unlike current
    solutions, the proposed technology ensures that traits will not be transferred
    to weeds or native plant species via pollen. The initial application is corn,
    the most valuable commercial crop in the US, with insights expected to enhance
    other crops. \n\nThe proposed project aims to create a chloroplast (plastid) transformation
    platform for engineering corn. Although chloroplast engineering (transplastomic)
    technology has been developed successfully in a number of dicot crop species (i.e.,
    tobacco, potato), a reproducible technology has not been developed for any monocot
    crop (i.e., corn, sorghum). The available evidence indicates that the rate-limiting
    step is the need for a strong selection system to enable the identification and
    amplification of rare transformed plastids in the embryogenic tissue culture systems
    typical for monocots. This project will create a Master Transformation Recipient
    Line (MTRL) of corn for use in a chloroplast engineering platform. The MTRL will
    contain a targeted genome deletion in a chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic gene,
    allowing for development of a new selection system that can lead to successful
    chloroplast engineering of monocot crops.  Ultimately, the corresponding wild-type
    chloroplast photosynthetic gene will be delivered to the MTRL with other desired
    traits, facilitating an elegant selection of transformed plastids with the deleted
    photosynthetic gene restored and as well as carrying the new traits of interest.\n\nThis

    emissions.  The hydrogen technology innovation will also help meet the growing
    demand in the hydrogen market, valued at $136 billion and growing at 8% annually,
    as well as unlock hydrogen in new industries, such as electrical generation, that
    in the past have deemed hydrogen production as a non-viable option due in part
    to the carbon emissions.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to construct
    an innovative hydrogen reformer that is more efficient than the leading hydrogen
    production technology while releasing zero carbon emissions. The main technical
    risk the research will address is the integration of technically complex systems
    into a seamless hydrogen generator. The proposed project will break the integrated
    system into components which will be evaluated prior to integration, thus reducing
    the overall project risk. Upon successful construction and testing of the proposed
    system, PureTech will have demonstrated the technical and economical feasibility
    of the proposed system. This proof will allow PureTech to embark on a path to
    build large-scale hydrogen production systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    recent advances in additive manufacturing to solve key technical hurdles and design

    is a well-established engineering technique and widely used in research and medical
    applications such as drug discovery and development, fertility treatments, and
    genetics research.  The proposed technology will use additive (3D) manufacturing
    techniques for a new microcapillary needle to improve the quality, reproducibility,

    will positively impact life sciences research and medical applications.\n \nThe
    proposed project will utilize state-of-the-art submicron-scale additive manufacturing
    technologies to revolutionize microinjection efficacy via substantive versatility
    in the design and fabrication of the needle-tip. In particular, two-photon direct
    laser writing (DLW) – wherein a focused laser is precisely positioned within a
    biocompatible photo material to produce 3D structures comprising cured material
    – provides an unparalleled level of geometric control with feature resolutions
    on the order of 100 nm. These capabilities enable new flexibility in re-architecting
    of the microneedle tip. In addition, due to recent enhancements in printing speed,
    DLW-based applications can now shift from niche demonstrations in the laboratory
    to fully functional commercial products that support rapid operation at scale.
    \ The project proposes multiple configurations for each proposed design change
    with respect to key performance metrics: the anti-clogging efficacy and fabrication
    repeatability.  This project will: establish and characterize novel manufacturing
    protocols, simulate expected characteristics, experimentally assess (both in the
    lab and in vitro using the zebrafish embryo) the quantitative efficacy of these
    distinct and novel architectures, and qualitatively evaluate the user's experience.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a portable, faster, cheaper, more sensitive, more consistent user-friendly electrochemical biosensor for detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticide (OPaC) residues.  While OPaC chemicals have greatly improved crop yields, they have also (1) caused accumulation of pesticide residues in the food chain, (2) promoted the generation of pesticide-resistant insects, and (3) contaminated the air, water and soil.  OPaC residues, therefore, are a significant public health concern.  The proposed sensor will:  increase the sensitivity and specificity for monitoring OPaCs (2) reduce costs associated with pesticide monitoring, and (3) improve portability of monitoring devices. Finally, the proposed biosensor technology could be adaptable for analyzing biofluids, making it transformative in monitoring environmental exposures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a more sensitive, field-deployable electrochemical biosensor for the detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticide (OPaC) residues. The system’s principle is that OPaCs bind/inhibit the activity of a highly sensitive designer acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, diminishing a readily detectable electrochemical current.  At the system’s core is a novel AChE enzyme more sensitive to OPaC residues than those currently in use.  The approach will further optimize the performance of this novel enzyme by rationally designing variants that decrease aggregation and increase/improve thermal stability, core packing, surface polarity, and backbone rigidity.  Finally, the approach will enhance OPaC detection sensitivity even further by increasing the surface area of the electrochemical sensory apparatus.  Briefly, the procedure is to submerge the sensor into a buffer to acquire and assign baseline data, add test samples to allow any OPaCs to bind to the optimized AChE enzyme on the sensor, add the AChE substrate acetylthiocholine to the sample, and measure electrochemical inhibition.  Taken together, this novel biosensor will result in a major shift in the way OPaC analysis is performed and pave the way for reliable, sensitive, and low-cost field analysis.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the care and quality of life of colon cancer patients by reducing or eliminating the need for temporary ostomies, saving $25+ k per patient in direct surgical costs and eliminating $8.5 k per patient in annual maintenance costs; this could generate total savings of $60 k per patient treated. The proposed solution could address the need for temporary ostomy surgery; this procedure is performed 300,000+ times per year in the US.  This system would reduce the risks of bowel leakage after colon resections, a problem occurring in roughly 36% of patients and generating fatal consequences in 22%. More importantly, the technology has the potential to dramatically reduce or eliminate the morbidity and mortality from ostomies and improve a patient’s quality of life.   The research and development of a reliable, reversible, and cost-effective means to protect segments of bowel has broader implications and potential applications to treating a number of disease conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease, bowel trauma, and even early colon cancer.

    The proposed project will develop a system to reduce diverting ostomies, which are often placed above the reconnection site to protect against leaks and their consequences. This project will develop an intraluminal fecal diversion technology using a novel anchoring mechanism that is safe, reliable, and easily reversible.  The goal of this project is to optimize the design of both the device and clinical treatment algorithms for design, safety, and use; and validate the new design and protocols in subsequent animal studies.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I Project is to measure the most critical metrics associated with breastfeeding in real time, namely milk volume and suck patterns. Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life is highly recommended. While U.S. breastfeeding initiation rates exceed 80%, only 25% of women are able to reach the six-month goal. The leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation is maternal anxiety about milk supply exacerbated by the absence of an accurate, inexpensive, and convenient means to assess infant milk intake. The current standard-of-care, weighing an infant before and after feeding, requires an expensive clinical scale to detect a 1-2% weight change, trained staff, tight swaddling of the infant, careful operation, and regular calibration. Even then, it’s still a tedious exercise and thus does not provide a quality representative measure of daily milk intake. There is therefore a need for a “thermometer for breastfeeding” – an accurate, easy-to-use device to be used for multiple feedings in both clinical and home settings. The technology developed in this project can be used for rapid identification and intervention for infants at high risk of feeding problems.

    This project aims to develop and validate the accuracy of a low-cost wearable patch measuring milk volume and suck patterns in real time. The patch operates by detecting changes in the shape and electrical properties of the breast and can be used for 1-12 feedings per day. Data are reported to a mobile app for tracking and analysis, as well as integration with other key metrics of infant feeding and growth. Several patch configurations will be built and tested to optimize the design and analysis algorithm. The design with highest accuracy will be further validated in a larger study involving breastfeeding mother-infant dyads.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce fuel consumption and improve safety in the trucking industry while increasing profitability. Over 70% of US freight tonnage is moved by the trucking industry, but at highway speeds, aerodynamic drag uses over 65% of the total vehicle energy. This project will develop a network of sensors and an artificial intelligence (AI-)control system.  This will be integrate with an experimental device that modifies the aerodynamic behavior of semi-trucks using air injection, enabling continuously optimized aerodynamic performance. This project will create a sensor system able to describe the micro-climate of a semi truck in real time, and an AI-control system to determine the trailer’s best aerodynamic profile based on current operating conditions. This system would create an energy savings for all US fleets of up to 3B+ gallons of unburned diesel for an annual total addressable market of $20B.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes development of an aerodynamic add-on prototype for trucks to save fuel by dynamically changing the trailer’s aerodynamic profile. To capture the operating conditions around the trailer in real time, this project will develop a sensor system to accurately measure the environment surrounding the vehicle. This project will explore relationships among environmental measurements, optimize the number and location of sensors, conduct the relevant systems engineering studies, and build a prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a safer alternative to gallbladder surgery for elderly patients at higher risks of complications due to the effects of general anesthesia. Approximately 200,000 Medicare patients undergo surgery to remove their gallbladders every year. Unfortunately, 24% of these patients will experience a perioperative complication due to the effects of general anesthesia, totaling $500 M in cost annually to the US healthcare system. As the population ages and management of chronic disease improves, the need for alternatives to gallbladder surgery increases. This project will develop a process to affect the entire surface of the gallbladder ("ablation"), inducing a healing response that will defunctionalize the gallbladder and obviate the need to remove it. This is the first technology designed to conduct this process within a tube via a minimally invasive approach. Ultimately, this technology could be adapted to create more effective devices for other high surface area tissue targets.

    The proposed project is a significant improvement over current state-of-practice ablation devices due to its ability to deliver high-surface area ablation within a closed lumen or organ, such as the gallbladder. Existing conductive devices are designed for targeted ablation of discrete lesions rather than therapeutic delivery to large tissue targets, such as the gallbladder. The aim of this project is to develop a new process using open lumen instillation of cryogen to achieve high surface area cryoablation of tissues. This raises several unique engineering challenges, including the design of a delivery mechanism for the uniform distribution of cryogen across a closed lumen and development of a pressure management system to properly evacuate the cryogen gas and prevent an increase in intraluminal pressure. Initial optimization of the cryogen distribution and pressure management system will be conducted using a benchtop thermal load model of the gallbladder to approximate the in vivo thermodynamics. Optimized designs will then be tested in acute and chronic animal models to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of open lumen instillation of cryogen for high surface area intraluminal cryoablation of the gallbladder.

    an intuitive, affordable hand-held retinal imager specifically targeted to primary
    care physicians and non-ophthalmologist healthcare providers.  Enabling widespread
    diabetic retinopathy screening at primary points of care will bring preventive
    screening to previously under served patient populations, including poor urban
    and rural areas. Allowing primary care physicians to offer these services will
    reduce the workload for over-burdened eye specialists. Freeing up specialists’
    time and resources to be utilized more efficiently will also reduce costs to the
    healthcare system. \n\nThis project seeks to develop a novel lens geometry that
    will enable more efficient illumination of the retina during imaging. The company's
    innovative and improved methodology will decrease imaging failure along with device
    size and cost, resulting in increased reliability, retinal screening efficiency,
    and accessibility. This project builds on empirical insights into the pitfalls
    and failure modes of retinal screening. Lenses with the novel geometry will be
    prototyped, and the optical performance of the lens and illumination system will
    be tested using physical and biological eye models. Briefly, computational modeling
    will be used to predict the properties (e.g., uniformity of retinal illumination)
    of candidate lens geometries challenged with a 5 mm aperture. Next, a physical
    prototype for the optical and electronic components will be assembled, followed
    by proof-of-concept tests with physical and biological models of the eye to compare
    the performance of prototype lenses to predicted values. These critical results
    will guide the company’s efforts to refine its design, transition from prototype
    to production model for cost-effective manufacturing, and to plan pilot trials
    as it moves this hand-held retinal imager toward the clinic.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project will be to enable new robotics systems with actuator hardware that is substantially lighter and less expensive than the current state-of-the-art. The high cost and limited performance of actuators are the greatest problems for engineers developing products for mobile applications, such as package delivery, security, disaster recovery, and wearable assistive devices, causing the market to bifurcate into low-cost robots with extremely limited functionality or versatile robots costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Clutches are an important way to reduce actuator requirements and costs, but conventional clutches are large, heavy, and power-hungry, ultimately negating potential improvements. In this project, we will develop an electro-adhesive clutch that is 10x lighter and uses 1000x less power than conventional clutches. This hardware innovation allows robotics engineers to use clutches with almost no mass or power consumption penalties. Removing this constraint will have a substantial impact on the commercial viability of robots that are both capable and affordable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will consist of the design and characterization of a compact rotary electro-adhesive clutch. This work will build on recent accomplishments in creating and characterizing the linear electro-adhesive clutch design to move toward a rotary design integrating with existing robotic joints with minimal required hardware changes. The objectives of this work are to experimentally optimize the effect of materials and design choices on the performance of the rotary electro-adhesive clutch, and to establish performance metrics to evaluate the feasibility of commercial use. Design work will include simulation, mass optimization, and exploration of fabrication techniques. The experimental work will characterize the system in terms of maximum torque, power, and speed testing, response time and dissipation testing, and preliminary fatigue and wear experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop special metal-free catalysts to dramatically reduce chemical manufacturing costs. In addition, these catalysts significantly expand the range of light-driven reactions, leading to profound advancements in pharmaceuticals, healthcare, agriculture, biology, material science, and other industries. Because light-driven chemical technology predominantly relies on scarce and expensive precious metal catalysts, it is limited today to small-scale R&D applications only. At scale, light-driven technology using metal-free catalysts can greatly reduce chemical manufacturing costs by replacing conventional reactions that rely on expensive precious metals, which are also limited to specific classes of reactions. This new chemistry will significantly expand the possibilities for applications of light-driven chemical technology, leading to novel products and greater consumer access through lower costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the suitability of metal-free (organic) photoredox catalysts (PCs) in challenging and important pharmaceutical reactions. Organic PCs are key enablers of photoredox catalysis, an emerging field of chemistry gaining significant traction in drug development. Driven by light absorption, photoredox catalysis offers significant advantages over conventional heat-driven methods (e.g. Pd catalysis), including cost, ease of use, and broadened fields-of-use. Importantly, organic PCs are sustainable and scalable alternatives to predominantly used precious metal PCs, allowing photoredox catalysis to extend to full industrial use, including drug manufacturing. To spur industrial adoption of photoredox catalysis, research objectives include proving feasibility of organic PCs in medicinally important reactions, while expanding substrate scope to include biologically relevant and highly functionalized substrates typically used in drug designs. Photoredox-catalyzed reactions powered by organic PCs will access new chemistries beyond capabilities of conventional heat-driven catalysis. In addition, guided by quantum simulations, new high-performance organic PCs will be developed with unique properties beyond those reported in the literature, unlocking new transformations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the reduction in home energy costs, electric grid system costs, and environmental impacts from electricity generation. The proposed research project will advance the state of the art in residential combined heating and hot water technology. The research project will resolve the technical risks associated with operating a high-efficiency CO2 heat pump in combined heating and hot water applications, and with implementing efficient load shifting in these applications. The project has the potential to reduce user energy costs, grid system costs, and environmental impacts by: shifting electrical load from peak demand times to off-peak demand times, reducing the need for costly and highly polluting peak power generation resources, and integrating variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar at times of low demand. This will put downward pressure on electric rates, as well as provide immediate user bill savings through lower demand and by shifting electricity demand to the cheapest times. The proposed system has the potential for large-scale commercial deployment due to its significantly lower operating costs and lowered initial fixed investments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to resolve technical challenges associated with the commercial deployment of high-efficiency CO2 heat pumps in combined heating and hot water applications. CO2 heat pumps have demonstrated high efficiency in hot water applications with coefficients of performance up to 5. However, they typically operate much less efficiently in combined systems due to a lack of advanced controls. The research will develop a thermal stratification model of a hot water tank based on customer use and charging conditions, a predictive thermal demand model, and a simulation model of the whole system integrating heat pump performance, tank stratification, and predictive customer demand. The project will then develop new controls (hardware and software) to optimize for user and grid costs and emissions and validate the effectiveness of the resulting control system by integrating it into the existing prototype. This assessment will demonstrate the commercial viability of CO2-based combined heat and hot water systems with load shifting.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to catalyze the domestic market for renewable solar
    heating and cooling. Over 50% of the world's energy provides heating and cooling

    to satisfy more than 60% of the hot water, space heating, and space cooling demands.
    This solution could address up to 4,400 TBtu of this demand, a $34 B opportunity,
    while reducing electricity consumption and demand for refrigerants. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will build on the proven solar
    heat architecture. The current solar heat only solution will be modified to enhance
    its inherent radiative cooling capability. The effort will focus on identifying

    of therapeutic options on an individual patient's biopsy. The microfluidic platform
    developed in this project aims to rapidly and accurately evaluate drug efficacy
    using individual patient's biopsies, thus guiding personalized cancer treatment
    and leading to increased survival rates, reduced cost of healthcare, and improved
    quality of patient life. In addition, this technology will facilitate cancer drug

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase I project aims to enable the use of biologics, a newer class of drugs transforming medicine due to its marked effectiveness and specificity, to treat diseases at wet surfaces of the body. Many diseases occur at wet surfaces in the body including the oral cavity, joints, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Local application of biologics is currently not used in these areas because the drugs are rapidly washed away before they have any benefit. Biologics are sometimes administered by infusion to treat these diseases, but this has risks of serious, even life-threatening side effects. If biologics could instead be delivered locally, side-effects would be much less of a concern and diseases at wet surfaces could be treated more aggressively and effectively than currently possible. Successful completion of the project will establish proof-of-concept for the technology and create a new platform to treat these diseases to the benefit of patients in ways that were previously impossible. The company will work with pharmaceutical partner companies to utilize their combined resources to commercialize these products and improve health outcomes.

    The central idea is to anchor biologics to wet surfaces so that they act for longer periods (hours or days). Traditional approaches to prolonged drug delivery use some form of problematic carrier; most cannot be used with biologics. The project will validate the technology as a treatment for common dry eye disease, using a mouse model. Antibodies are by far the largest class of biologics, and a procedure has been developed to attach anchors to antibodies while maintaining their activity. The research aims are to validate that: 1) Attaching an anchor prolongs the time an antibody resides on the cornea. The residency time on the corneal surface will be measured using fluorescently labeled antibodies with and without an anchor. 2) An anchored anti-inflammatory antibody is an effective drug to treat dry eye. The effects on the severity of dry eye disease by treating mice with antibodies with and without an anchor will be determined. These aims will test the hypothesis that attaching an anchor to a biologic increases its residency time and its therapeutic efficiency providing proof-of-concept. No other publicly known method of solving the drug washout problem in this manner to treat dry eye disease exists.

    this group, the population over 85 years of age is the fastest growing segment.
    Seniors and caregivers will benefit from the new sensor technology developed in
    this project, whether they live in their own homes or in assisted-living facilities,
    contributing to healthcare quality improvement and cost reduction. The advanced
    signal processing and machine learning techniques developed in this project will
    advance the field of data analytics and smart sensing. \n\nThe proposed project
    is the first to develop a real-time contactless sleep monitoring device based
    on vibration sensing. The sensor will provide reliable monitoring of sleep activities
    and vital signs while placed under mattresses in various building environments.
    This project will mark the first attempt to develop a contactless blood pressure
    monitoring function. The advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms
    will be refined and validated regarding vital sign estimation (heart rate, respiration
    rate, and blood pressure) and sleep activity recognition (entry/exit of the bed,
    movement, posture change). A key challenge of data analytics algorithm development
    is to self-adapt to changes in the physical and noise environment. Various algorithms
    and functions will be integrated into one device with a user-friendly graphic
    interface; then the product's advantages and limitations will be evaluated systematically
    in different relevant environments and compared with other devices.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling interventional radiologists to prevent pneumothorax (collapsed lung) during transthoracic lung biopsies. Annually, over 1.2 million transthoracic lung biopsies are performed worldwide for lung cancer diagnosis (400,000 in the US). Pneumothorax (PTX), a collapsed lung, is the most common complication of this procedure, occurring in 20-40% of all transthoracic lung biopsies. More than half of PTX turn symptomatic and require an invasive chest tube insertion, the definitive treatment for PTX. This complication costs, on an average, $15,000 per chest tube insertion and $1.3 billion worldwide to treat. This turns a same-day diagnostic procedure into a costly multi-day hospitalization.

    The research objectives of the proposed project are to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of using a biopolymer sealant and novel access/delivery device to seal needle tracts to prevent PTX during transthoracic lung biopsies. Further, in-vitro and in-vivo preliminary biocompatibility of the material as well as efficacy of the delivery device as compared to the current standard of care will be investigated.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the ability to control zebra & quagga mussel
    infestations with a cost-effective and target-specific biological treatment. In
    addition to the estimated $7 billion economic impact, mussel infestation causes
    substantial ecological impacts. Currently, there is no treatment option available
    following infestation by quagga or zebra mussels functional at the scale of commercial
    reservoirs without significant disruption of native species. The successful development
    of an efficient and specific treatment has the potential to improve the ability

    the potential to lower production cost, and require a lower effective dose when
    compared to current treatment options. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a biopesticide comprised of the enzymatic portion of a toxin for the
    mechanism of action and the binding domains from antibodies for targeting zebra
    and quagga mussels. Control of infestation by chemical means is largely restricted
    to enclosed systems, and requires additional remediation prior to water use. Biopesticides,
    however, can be considered a reduced risk treatment option. The use of ScFv (single
    chain variable fragment regions) from mAbs (monoclonal antibodies) has become
    common place in pharmaceuticals like Herceptin and MT-3724 and can be used here,
    resulting in a treatment product with anticipated high specificity, high efficiency,
    known mechanism of action, limited half-life, no expected long-term environmental

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves a low-cost, convenient, anonymous floor occupancy analysis. This will be achieved by developing a powerless, flexible subfloor sensor mat that can integrate with regular flooring products. If implemented in buildings, the sensor mat will help raise space utilization, improve occupant productivity and satisfaction, and inform dynamic layout planning for organizational agility. This sensor mat will address the needs from different parties in the small building ecosystem, including flooring manufacturers, building system integrators, work space system providers, architects and interior designers, and cooperations and businesses in commercial buildings. Additionally, this thin film with high electrical output, if successfully achieved in this project, will find great commercialization potential in other applications, such as self-powered, wireless adhesive wearable electronics, and implantable medical devices. This proposal also has an environmental impact in that it reduces carbon footprint, promotes use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.

    The proposed project has the intellectual merits of addressing two key questions that could determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the occupancy sensor mat.  First, how to create a sufficiently thin and flexible sensor mat that has no impact on flooring installment and walking performance. Second, how to raise the electrical output and energy generated from the sensor mat to the level that is high enough to meet the requirements of signal resolution and wireless transmission? Specific research tasks and methods include: natural cellulosic materials chemical functionalization for electric property engineering towards high power output; sensor mat design to effectively convert footsteps to electricity within a confined mat thickness; integration of wireless transmission units tailored for the sensor mat towards a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. The final goal is to develop a powerless sensor from which the electrical output and the energy generation will be sufficient to sustain itself and to provide discernible data.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of safe and effective, toxin-free biocontrol
    of insects and other invasive organisms. Mosquitoes and other insects cost upwards
    of $10 B/year to the world economy due to their impact on human health and revenue
    losses to agriculture. Current control measures available are neither effective,
    environmentally friendly, scalable for widespread application, nor cost effective
    to implement. This project aims to address the above deficiencies. The goal is
    to develop insect control methods that are effective, have minimal environmental
    impact and are cost effective to implement and hence attractive to commercialization.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a genetically modified sterile
    male accelerated release technique (SMART) for Aedes aegypti mosquito control.
    The innovative development of SMART mosquitoes solves several issues in mosquito
    control, including: sorting of males and females, transportation of adult males,
    laborious release processes, and non-scalable operation. The SMART approach requires
    eggs that can be produced at a centralized facility, stored at room temperature
    until needed, and inexpensively shipped at room temperature in a small container.
    Customers need only add water with supplied nutrients to hatch the eggs, from
    which only males emerge that amplify male sterility by producing sterile males
    with each reproduction cycle. The scope of the research proposal is limited to
    creating synthetic genetic incompatibility in mosquitoes by targeting germline
    male sterility. The key technical objectives are to: 1) optimize components of
    programmable transcriptional activators in mosquitoes and 2) engineer synthetic

    materials are available in large biotech markets but require teacher training,
    purchase of materials and check-out and return of equipment. In this, instruction
    is limited to a few high schools in key biotech hubs. Our goal is to give every
    student in the country equal access to biotech training by building a laboratory
    in their pocket through the proposed product. Through use of mobile devices, a
    $100 tablet can replace thousands of dollars in laboratory equipment. Everything
    the student needs to complete their studies will be included in the app or through
    in-app purchases. Teacher training would be minimal because back-end validation
    of all reagent kits and accompanying gear is completed to make its use seamless
    and universally applicable. All accompanying information required for the teacher
    is provided including in-App assessment tools of student performance. The app
    may be downloaded by anyone in the country and gear/reagents rapidly shipped directly

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to decrease the number of overweight trucks on the roads by developing a financially and technically practical screening tool to detect overweight vehicles on most roads in real-time. Overweight commercial vehicles are a significant cause of the nation's crumbling roads and bridges besides being a prime threat to transportation safety.

    The proposed project addresses the issue of effectively detecting overweight trucks on roads using real-time video-images while neither interfering with the traffic flow nor integrity the pavement. The proprietary system, WeighCam system, includes proprietary electro-optical system, algorithms, and system design. It will be easy to operate and robust in the sense that it will reliably work in most ambient environmental conditions such as ambient luminosity changes, etc. The purpose of this research will be to validate the basics of the system and calibrate the measurements using known weights to deduce the system limitations and to establish the feature sets of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a necessary step to start the manufacture of a commercial prototype. The final prototype will be a practical, autonomous, quick to install, and continuously operating continuous system sending data in real time.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will revolutionize the way older adults who live independently at home are monitored. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), nearly 90% of older adults (age 65 and above) prefer to stay independently at their homes, coining the term "ageing in place". The proposed monitoring system monitors older adults in real time for changes in physical activity, falls, and loss of balance. These parameters can indicate changes in frailness in older adults which if addressed early can extend their period of independent living. The system will monitor blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, and common cardiac conditions that often accompany loss of balance or falls, which can trigger early and more informed intervention that will allow issues to be addressed before a more serious injury occurs due to a fall. Current industry solutions rely on reactively initiating assistance after a fall is detected, which are usually too late to reverse the age-related deterioration and are ineffective at extending independent living. Ability of living independently longer for older adults will translate into significant savings in cost of care and will also improve their wellbeing.

    The proposed project will develop an end-to-end monitoring systems for older adults living independently at home consisting of: 1) Development of a small wearable device for measurement of Heart Rate, Pulse Oximetry, Blood Pressure, and ECG; 2) Development of activity monitoring system and classification of activities that can be used in tracking frailty of a monitored older adult. Changes in frailty can be observed remotely, allowing for early intervention and potentially the ability to reverse physical or mental degradation. In addition, the system can assist in the decision when the older adults need a full-time caregiver to remain at home, which is difficult and usually preceded by some serious accident or medical emergency, such as a fall resulting in hospitalization or a serious illness. Such delayed decision can have serious life-threatening consequences.  The advancements will be made in activity monitoring, non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring to track changes in blood pressure, and integration of anomaly detection into ECG waveform analysis to provide additional information when loss of balance or fall occurs. Such real time monitoring will tax the battery of the wearable device and will be addressed by exploring anomaly-based energy management to prolong battery life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project results from the ability to design a reusable nanofiltration membrane platform for wastewater treatment. Energy-efficient and effective wastewater treatment for water purification and reuse remains a tremendous challenge because safe and reliable approaches are often capital and energy intensive. The production of clean water from wastewater for municipal or industrial reuse requires the removal of a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants, including many hazardous and toxic substances (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Energy costs are driven even higher by the high fouling propensity of polymeric membranes with the wide array of water contaminants.  Preventing fouling and enabling high contaminant rejection with low energy requirements remain the two core challenges of membrane filtration for wastewater treatment. The proposed technology will address the two core challenges through the use of an anti-fouling surface chemistry. The low energy requirements, contaminant rejection, and anti-fouling properties of the proposed membrane make it a disruptive innovation that can easily penetrate the market, providing a cost-effective solution that is lacking in current membrane purification systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a nanofiltration technology utilizing surface chemistry modification for the creation of an anti-fouling membrane for the rejection of pesticides.  The United States spends nearly $9 billion a year on pesticides, which account for 16% of the world pesticide market. Out of the 25 most common active ingredients in pesticides, 76% are water soluble, which leads to contaminated soil, groundwater, and nearby bodies of water. The objectives of this project are to remove common commercial pesticides from water while investigating the advantageous effects of an anti-fouling membrane surface. Performance of the membrane will be investigated through cross flow filtration experiments to identify rejection, stability, and anti-fouling properties. The vision is to create a nanofiltration membrane  with a broad contaminant rejection while decreasing energy requirements and fouling.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Anti-Microbial Graphene Oxide Nanofiltration Membrane'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to demonstrate feasibility and determine the capacity
    of an innovative advanced, high-rate wet weather treatment technology to cost-effectively
    protect environmental and public health during high-intensity rain events by eliminating
    sewer overflows and basement back-ups. The wastewater utility industry has demonstrated
    a great unmet need for reliable, cost-effective, end-of-pipe wet weather treatment
    as an alternative to expensive long-term plans that emphasize large capital projects.
    The innovative approach being scaled and optimized during this project seeks to
    achieve the same or higher level of treatment in 35 minutes as conventional wastewater
    treatment achieves in 10-14 hours. A lower treatment time means a smaller system
    footprint and, ultimately, cost savings for the utility and ratepayers. The technology
    will address customer needs by identifying potential sewer overflow \"hotspots\"
    that act as \"drains\" in the utility sewershed during storm events. Each drain
    solution would alleviate overburdened collection, conveyance, and treatment systems
    by treating wet weather flows and safely releasing them into waterways. This innovative
    technology can also be applied at a water reclamation facility to handle overburden
    or as a mobile unit during disaster relief efforts.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes the evaluation of novel concepts including the application of advanced
    oxidation processes (AOPs) for wet weather treatment, the combination of rapid
    solid removal technologies with AOPs, and the use of a sustainable waste material
    as a catalyst for enhanced hydroxyl radical production in catalytic ozonation.
    None of the above aspects have been commercially implemented. The work proposed
    will demonstrate the ability for advanced technologies to be cost-effectively
    applied for wet weather treatment, disrupting the standard of partial combined
    sewer overflow treatment by providing a viable option for rapid wet weather treatment
    that meets or exceeds Clean Water Act discharge standards. These concepts will
    be applied at a pilot scale treating real wastewater to determine the technical
    and chemical scaling factors for commercial feasibility. Metrics for success within
    the research plan include aggressive conventional contaminant removal goals, increased
    flowrate for overall decreased treatment time and footprint, and a targeted cost
    ($/gallon treated) analysis to ensure competitive edge in the market. It is expected
    that the results will further demonstrate the importance of solids removal ahead
    of AOPs, and the implementation of catalytic ozonation will demonstrate increased
    efficacy and flexibility as the technology scales.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop an affordable, easy-to-use, novel feed
    additive formulation for dairy cows that will result in reduced enteric methane
    production while providing financial benefits for producers. Methane is the second
    largest contributor to greenhouse gases and the raising of ruminant animals is
    a significant source. Methane is not only burdensome to the environment, it is
    also wasteful to the dairy industry because its formation in animal digestive
    systems creates a 10% loss in potential energy for meat, milk, leather, or animal
    labor. As such, there is growing desire from consumers, advocates, and the dairy
    industry to produce a more environmentally friendly product. Preliminary results
    of incorporating this novel feed additive formulation point towards an additional
    $20 of income per head from the increase in feed efficiency, along with a 50%
    decrease in enteric methane formation. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a novel probiotic that, when paired with nitrate, will reduce enteric
    methane emissions in dairy cows. The research plan will include four successive
    28-day periods, with 21 days for diet adaptation and seven days for data and sample
    collection, to assess the effects of a nitrate and P. fortis formulation. The
    experiment will consist of a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design. Eight ruminally-cannulated,
    mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows will be assigned to one of two Latin squares
    and fed each of four diets over the four periods. After completion of this study,
    a more precise cost-benefit analysis will be performed with the resulting data,
    which will include milk yields, nitrogen balance, metabolic data, and methane
    outputs. In addition, the plan is to examine the rumen microbiome via sequencing
    to better understand the mode of action. In conjunction with the product manufacturing
    cost, this data will be used to determine the feasibility of this product. Cost
    savings are expected from producing a more environmentally friendly dairy, a reduction
    in foodborne pathogens, a decrease in morbidity/mortality, and an increase in
    feed efficiency.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development of a smart hydrocephalus shunt system. Senseer's sensor technology is widely applicable to implantable and external catheters for many clinical indications; however, the company's first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of CSF in the brain's ventricles. It is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail or become obstructed at alarming rates (40% after 1st year of use), quickly leading to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention, i.e., shunt replacement. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. Patients and doctors alike seek an accurate, reliable method for the timely detection of shunt failure. Senseer's MultiSense shunt system, integrated with the company's patented impedimetric sensor technologies, will allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health.

    To surpass the limitations of existing implantable sensors, Senseer has patented impedimetric sensors, which are designed to interact directly with physiological fluid and be chronically implanted in  the human body. A combination of sensors (pressure, flow, catheter patency, temperature, and cerebral blood flow waveform) will generate an unprecedented diagnostic data set for data analytics. This will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics over time. Senseer's system would include several significant first-to-market capabilities, include chronic repeated measurement of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and disseminations. Scientific milestones include development of an integrated multi-sensor array for up to five biometric measurements; wireless electronics for inductive power and signal transmission for interrogating implantable sensors; miniaturized packaging with implantable form factor; software for sensor calibration, data storage, and data analysis; and a benchtop hydrocephalus model for system validation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to advance cryopreservation technologies for the development of a seed banking product for commercially important aquaculture species.  Genetic banking of plant cells, tissues, seeds, and embryos is common practice in agriculture to ensure important genetic lines are not lost due to disease outbreak or environmental catastrophe. However, genetic banking of embryos and larvae within the aquaculture industry is nonexistent to date, and the investments made toward genetic improvements are susceptible to catastrophic loss without a proper seed banking product. The inability to reliably preserve seed for long periods of time is currently a barrier to the formation of an aquaculture seed storage product. This research will enhance scientific and technological understanding for the cryopreservation of aquatic organisms and be a transformative step to protect genetic resources vital to the commercial aquaculture industry.  These technological advancements also can be adapted for the conservation of threatened or endangered aquatic organisms important to food security and ecosystem health domestically and abroad.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a technology to implement a genetic banking product that allows aquaculture facilities to "cryobank" thousands of seeds from family lines developed over years of selective breeding programs.  Recent advancements in rapid cooling for storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196 degrees C) and ultra-rapid rewarming (~107  degrees C/min) have led to major breakthroughs in cryopreservation research. These advancements will be utilized to develop a low throughput, high efficacy strategy for the successful cryopreservation of an important aquaculture species, Litopenaeus vannamei or Pacific white shrimp.  Protocol optimization for cryoprotective agent loading/unloading, vitrification, and ultra-rapid warming will result in high revival, survival, and grow out to post larval stages.  Once proven, the technique will be scaled up to develop a high throughput process to successfully cryopreserve >10,000 samples per day.  This technology will enable the commercial aquaculture industry to conserve important genetic strains and stockpile cryopreserved seed at the levels necessary to avoid interruptions to food supply commonly caused by disease outbreaks and environmental catastrophe.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to transform the manner in which people and entities engage in transfer of value.   In our current economy, many businesses operate as middlemen between the producer of a good or service and the consumer of that good or service. Examples of such businesses can be categorized as financial services, exchange services, and regulated utilities. These intermediaries create a large inefficiency on producers, consumers, and the economy as a whole. Many of these businesses can be replaced partly or in whole by open source public blockchains. Over time, open-source public blockchains will competitively evolve to deliver the highest economic value for all market participants at the lowest cost. Although blockchain technology has enormous promise to positively impact society, current public blockchains have not been able to scale sufficiently to meet the needs of most enterprise applications.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop BlockReduce: a scalable, trustless, public blockchain for enterprise applications. BlockReduce presents a new blockchain topology to offer 3+ orders of magnitude improvement in transaction throughput while avoiding the introduction of hierarchical power structures and centralization. Additionally, BlockReduce is able to provide low-cost transactions with stable fees, which is key to enabling countless enterprise applications. By answering the issues of scale, cost, and access to public blockchains, BlockReduce will be the catalyst for enterprises moving from proof-of-concept (PoC) blockchain demonstrations to full scale deployments. If successful, BlockReduce could serve as fundamental infrastructure for digital value exchanges much like ethernet was technological infrastructure for digital information exchange.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes
    protection of municipal-level first responders and local communities from radiological
    hazards through affordable continuous wide-area radiation monitoring (RM). Radiological
    threats range from the ultimate high-consequence-rare-event posed by radiological
    dispersal devices and stolen or unaccounted for special nuclear material to more
    common and routine radiological events triggered by radiological sources from
    construction, power, medicine, and industry. Regardless of the threat, current
    radiological equipment and training is inadequate, and first responders are ill-equipped
    to deal with radiological incidents that occur in urban environments. Due to technology
    and training costs, comprehensive radiation surveillance systems can be adopted
    by only the largest and wealthiest cities, leaving most municipalities and local
    first responders unprotected. The project will develop an RM system that is easily
    deployed, alerts to spectral anomalies as well as radiation levels, requires no
    specialized training for front-line operators, and is vastly more cost effective
    than existing systems. This RM system can be deployed in a variety of complex
    environments regardless of size or density. The end result is accurate, real-time
    mapping of large geographical areas that can be used to detect, analyze, and interpret
    radiation levels in a variety of environments. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides innovative approaches in building a spatial-temporal-spectral
    database of gamma radiation to monitor change detection over large urban areas.
    The concept is to improve general radiation awareness as well as source detection
    capability by having continuous monitoring. Rather than attempting to identify
    specific isotopes in spectral observations ? which is difficult at long distances
    and requires highly sensitive detectors ? it is possible to detect temporal anomalies
    in spectral shape by keeping a database of past observations. This provides for
    profound increases in detection distance or likewise, in faint source detection.
    For successful commercialization of the RM system, innovative research is needed
    in two main areas: 1) universal multi-sensor integration through boot-strapped
    autocalibration and integrated continuous health monitoring, which this proposal
    will address via field deployment of multiple sensors to characterize with novel
    sensor-to-sensor fusion methodologies; and 2) municipal infrastructure optimization
    that will permit surveys to be conducted in a distributed fashion without dedicated
    survey vehicles, which this proposal will address by collecting data and building
    operational research optimization models for key aspects of the mobile sensor
    deployment concept, answering critical questions on the economic viability of
    the approach.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    Transfer (STTR) project is the integration of energy conversion and energy storage
    technologies into a single ribbon called the Solar Supercapacitor (SolarCap).
    The innovative aspect of SolarCap technology is that it is a self-powering ribbon
    which can be weaved along with cotton fibers to make a fabric. Batteries are currently
    being employed for powering wearable electronics used in remote places during
    multiple day trips with limited supplies and resources. However, most batteries
    are heavy, have a short life span, and are expensive, and transporting them to
    hostile locations can be difficult and dangerous. The SolarCap ribbons will have
    a considerable commercial impact since it can be used to charge the wearable electronics
    devices while woven on the user's backpack, clothing, etc. The proposed study
    will answer several key scientific questions including energy storage capability,
    stability, charge-recharge cycle life and durability of the SolarCap ribbons.
    The core value of the proposed SolarCap is that it can provide soldiers, firefighters,
    first responders, and outdoor personals increased mobility, comfort, flexibility,
    and peace of mind concerning device's electrical power while in the field. It
    can also reduce the physical load carried by the user. \n\n\nThis Small Business

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the improvements to the strength, durability, and longevity of concrete infrastructure and construction materials with novel graphene-rich carbon nanomaterial additives. Advancement of this technology area (advanced materials/nanomaterials for infrastructure applications) will directly reduce the costs of construction and maintenance ($165B/year in public spending) while supporting the nation's core economic activities ($14T/year in transported goods). The enhanced strength and longevity of nanocarbon coatings and concrete composites will reduce the amount of raw material required to meet specifications resulting in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (concrete production is responsible for 7% of global GHG emissions). The innovation will enhance scientific understanding of the effect of graphene-rich additives on the permeability and strength of concrete and coating composites using both advanced analytical techniques (x-ray tomography) and industry standard procedures (ASTM testing). It will also enhance understanding of the processing required (e.g. functionalization and dispersion) to integrate graphene-rich additives into polyurethane materials and concrete. Additionally, the project will help refine the plasma-based process conditions to produce carbon materials optimized for these applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate enhancement of mechanical properties and impermeability of construction materials' concrete and concrete coatings using graphene-rich nanocarbon additives derived from microwave plasma conversion of natural gas. The permeability of concrete is its primary pitfall and is responsible for the two most common causes of failure: carbonation and chloride contamination. Sealants can extend concrete's lifespan but are expensive to apply and often deteriorate rapidly due to environmental effects (UV, chemicals, mechanical abrasion). Graphene additives can enhance the barrier properties and mechanical strength of concrete and sealants, but are currently too costly for construction and infrastructure applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the barrier and mechanical properties of concrete and sealants using a novel graphene-based carbon nanomaterial produced using a cost-effective, scalable, plasma-based process. Carbon nanomaterials will be produced at varied process conditions and, following post-treatment and functionalization, will be incorporated into polyurethane formulations and concrete mixtures. Water and chloride penetration into composites will be examined using advanced x-ray tomographic 3D imaging. Composites will undergo further testing in accordance with AASHTO/ASTM-standards. The anticipated results will establish the technical benefits of using graphene-based nanocarbon additives in concrete and sealants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to improve the safety testing of new drugs for approval by the FDA.  By decreasing the time and costs associated with safety testing, the product will make all classes of new drugs safer, less expensive and available to patients sooner.  All new drugs must demonstrate that they are safe.  One common and critical point at which new candidate treatments fail is because they have the serious side effect of promoting sudden cardiac death through lethal arrhythmias. This product combines advanced biological techniques with advanced computing to develop a system that will enable pharma and biotech companies to more rapidly and accurately identify pro-arrhythmic drugs earlier in the development process, thus saving drug companies significant costs associated with drug development. Drugs that ultimately fail cardiac safety screening need to be eliminated as soon as possible from the development pipeline, and certainly pre-clinically. A drug that makes it to clinical trials before cardiac side effects are identified can result in significant wasted costs, in addition to the human cost. Conversely, a drug incorrectly eliminated also can be costly, both in terms of lost revenue and benefit to society.

    This STTR Phase I is a proposal to improve the extraction of key data from experiments on the HERG ion channel and its interpretation through computational modeling in the new FDA CiPA initiative. Preclinical safety testing currently focuses on two interdependent questions: 1) Does the drug block the HERG channel? and 2) Does the drug prolong the action potential? The CiPA initiative proposes to integrate this process systematically, through screening of a defined set of cloned ion channels in high throughput systems and combing this with action potential modelling through the qNet index. The HERG channel is handled separately using a complex state-dependent block model that due to its complexity requires very difficult and time consuming manual measurements. This proposal will automate this process by using a real-time interface to computer model block and evaluate the information coming from voltage clamp experiments as they occur.  As such it will be an artificial intelligence that will substitute for the judgement of a human experimenter by focusing only on protocols and exposure times that define the kinetics of a particular drug.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves the advancement of biomaterials development for nerve repair. Each year in the U.S. alone, surgeons perform around 550,000 procedures to repair peripheral nerves affected by traumatic or iatrogenic nerve injury, which are associated with an economic burden due to loss in employee productivity in excess of $150B per year. Peripheral Nerve Injury (PNI) can severely impact the quality of life, productivity, and interpersonal relationships of injured patients. Existing materials are primarily indicated for use as passive support or to prevent complications (e.g., mechanical instability, neuroma, or donor site morbidity associated with autograft). None of these products has shown clinical improvement in functional outcomes. As such, any technology or method that can accelerate or improve nerve repair is of significant interest as it can improve quality of life for those with nerve injuries and reduce the economic burden associated with long term disability for those with nerve injuries.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to undertake the initial development and testing of a porcine tissue-based nerve conduit.  The objective of this proposal is to fabricate conduits that have suitable mechanical, structural, and biological properties to provide an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration in nerve gap injuries. The proposed work includes the development and in vitro characterization of the conduit, as well as in vivo testing in a small animal model of nerve gap repair. The animal study will compare the functional outcomes obtained with the proposed conduits with those obtained with commercially available conduits and autografts. Pilot studies have suggested that the proposed conduits have the potential to promote key early events in the nerve regeneration process leading to the formation of functional nerve tissue. The expected outcome is that the proposed conduits will be superior to existing nerve guides and allografts, enabling improvements in nerve repair and providing improvements in the clinical care of affected patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to address a significant pain point for farmers associated with reducing nitrogen fertilizer input costs. The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer.  These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to bring to the market a faster and cheaper means of gathering highly accurate local air quality.  This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study and develop methods to provide adult professionals and young adult students with the skills and self-confidence to pursue studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Today, a large segment of society identifies as being underrepresented in the technology sector. Some individuals experience low technology-related self-confidence as a result. At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs. When people see themselves as future practitioners of a technical skill, it is possible to learn topics in a deeper, more fulfilling, and more enduring manner. Commercializing this invention will increase online learning platform retention rates, driving revenue not only within educational companies but within the companies who hire the resulting talent.


    The proposed technology is innovative because no commercially-available software tools exist which support metacognitive development in tandem with technical skill acquisition. This innovation is risky because no one has proven that having a positive influence on metacognition through automated software is even possible during single learning session. The goal of this research is to deliver techniques for enhancing the self-efficacy of STEM learners within the context of online learning platforms. The project combines best practices in digital personalization and educational psychology research to deliver customized content responsive to learner preferences and learner attitude attributes. The proposed research will demonstrate, via a random trial, increased levels of motivation and engagement in students who receive targeted interventions as compared with a control population. Using survey instruments, the researchers will measure changes in self-efficacy, challenge-seeking, and goal-setting behavior. Because the research team has unique experience in developing proven educational interventions which enhance self-efficacy across a variety of learning domains, the algorithms and methods inside the proposed technology will be difficult for competitors to replicate. This SBIR project will deliver algorithms and automated, web-based interventions to help all STEM learners experience personal engagement with STEM topics and find empowerment in the task of learning.

    I project aims at demonstrating a ubiquitous multipoint touch and force sensing
    on planar or curved surfaces that are either conducting (metals) or insulators
    (glass/plastic). Current multipoint touch sensing technologies are limited to
    transparent, insulating and planar surfaces. These technologies involve patterning
    multiple layers of semitransparent films on a glass or polyamide substrate then
    integrated with the display in a complex manufacturing process. The films? semitransparent

    cost reduces deployment and hence limits access to the wider consumer society.
    This project targets developing a low-cost technology that detects force and location
    of multi touch points on any surface without film patterning. Successful execution
    and deployment of the proposed technology would increase deployment of multipoint
    touch and force sensing in consumer electronics and hence a broader access in

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project covers a myriad of domains including wireless health-care, remote education, supply-chain management, public safety, anti-poverty initiatives, market-places, and entertainment. However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    reduction of food waste.  Food waste is a critically important global challenge.
    Approximately 30% of food produced for human consumption around the world is either
    lost or wasted each year – more than enough to feed the hungry.  It is estimated
    that food loss and waste also contribute 8% of the total global greenhouse gas

    convert commercial grade zein to a readily water-soluble formulation. The project
    will develop an effective edible food coating that incorporates other plant-based
    ingredients, such as fatty acids and plasticizers, to create a hybrid protein/lipid
    film that (1) exhibits excellent gas barrier as well as moisture barrier properties
    and extends the shelf life of many under-served commodities; (2) can be generated
    at reasonable cost; and (3) can be delivered in a single application on existing
    food processing equipment. The R&D plan will target coatings for a variety of
    fresh produce that allows comparison with competitive coatings where possible,
    and provides new coating options where few options are available.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    Research (SBIR) project is to create transparency around the business logic used
    by stakeholders in the healthcare system to make transactional decisions as well
    as create alignment around the current status of healthcare transactions that
    are part of the work in process. To most people who interact with the healthcare
    system, it functions more or less as a \"black box\" with decisions that sometimes
    defy logic and common sense. Our goal is to use Blockchain and Machine Learning
    technology to convert this \"black box\" into a \"glass box.\" The commercial
    impact of this project could be an up to 25% reduction in claims processing costs
    for healthcare providers by the elimination of redundant work, re-work and errors.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase 1 project proposes two innovations: 1) claims transaction
    and reason codes managed through a Blockchain so that Providers and Payers can
    confidently know the accurate status of a claim, and 2) sophisticated statistical
    and deep learning algorithms for predicting the likelihood of a claim denial with
    natural language processing of associated notes and appeals. Our product is a
    mathematically driven software service that utilizes and innovates with multiple
    technologies: Blockchain distributed ledgers, smart contracts and tokens, and
    prediction, recommendation, forecasting, non-linear optimization and natural language
    processing engines within a privacy-preserving data management system.\n\nThis

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase 1 project will advance technology to significantly
    improve the standard of care within corrective surgery for spinal deformity. Approximately
    55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality
    of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to
    mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.
    \ It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.
    \ However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make
    it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as
    it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based
    imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure,
    and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute
    to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for
    repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology
    that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal
    alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and
    radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative
    feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve
    surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. \n\nThis project
    repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling
    it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with
    these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative
    measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging
    technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path
    to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes
    the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also
    integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion
    of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific
    decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary
    team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in
    translating medical devices into impactful commercial products. The aims within
    this project include the development of novel tracking-system augmentation hardware,
    image-analysis algorithms, optimization of accuracy via benchtop testing, and
    validation via testing with cadaveric specimens.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop a new process to reshape batteries through rapid, custom manufacturing. The battery industry’s manufacturing process has remained relatively unchanged over the past 40 years, impacting applications such as Digital Health and the Internet of Things (IoT). This project will develop a novel platform for battery manufacturing using a cure-on-command technology, which will expedite the components curing process from hours to seconds. The cure-on-command technology will provide added multiple benefits to battery manufacturing through elimination of certain processing steps, such as cost savings, capital equipment savings of 3x, and environmental friendliness.

    The aims of this project are to benchmark the benefits of cure-on-command technology for rapid manufacturing of battery components, demonstrate its application for ultra-thin, flexible batteries, and highlight its technical and economic benefits to battery manufacturing. The biggest hurdle to new methods in battery manufacturing has been the thermal evaporation process, which is a slow (<67 m2/min) and toxic process. This project will advance a faster (>500 m2/min) curing process.  The key objectives of this proposal will be: (1) formulate zinc-silver oxide battery materials with cure-on-command technology, (2) test performance and durability of batteries in comparison with the state-of-the-art battery manufacturing process and materials, and (3) integrate and test a small prototype battery (20-220 mAh) to replace bulky, rigid coin cells in devices for Digital Health and IoT applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to enhance the health of livestock without addition of synthetic antibiotic and antioxidant compounds. The proposed technologies are corn kernel fiber byproducts of ethanol production from corn. The need for such compounds has grown as livestock is now more often raised in concentrated animal feeding operations that confine animals and result in abnormal oxidative stress. The program is based on extracting these naturally occurring compounds from agricultural residues.  These extracts can be used in place of antibiotics and synthetic supplements currently in livestock feeds.  The process proposed will enable production at a cost competitive with synthetic supplements.

    This STTR project proposes to assess the biological activity of hydroxy cinnamic acids and their oligomers (HCAs) as beneficial supplements in livestock feed. They are ester-linked to a hemicellulose known to occur in seed crop brans. The linkage is hydrolyzed during pretreatment of corn bran fiber to prepare it for conversion to ethanol and the HCAs dissolve in the pretreatment solution. As free acids they recover their character, which includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The project will provide kilogram quantities of HCAs for use in feeding trials with young swine, wherein they will be compared with naturally sourced feed supplements currently in use in Europe, as well as un-supplemented feed. Components of the extract will be identified and comprehensive biochemical analyses performed, including study of the gastrointestinal physiology and intestinal permeability. Studies will also be performed of gut microbiomes and how the processes involved are influenced by substitution of HCAs as the primary feed supplement. Successful completion of these studies will provide a basis for more comprehensive studies of the use of HCAs as supplements in the diet of other livestock.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is to develop a novel drug delivery system composed of peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles for targeted and sustained therapeutic peptide release to the intestine. The gastrointestinal system and gut microbiome have emerged as critical drivers of human health, offering new opportunities to treat diseases such as food allergies, fungal infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and hyperoxaluria. However, a new class of drug systems are required to target the local biology of these diseases. The first indication pursued is hyperoxaluria and associated recurrent kidney stones and kidney diseases. With over ~27M calcium oxalate kidney stone (KS) patients in the U.S. (affecting 1 in 5 men and 1 in 11 women) and even higher global incidence, KS is a healthcare epidemic with no effective medication. Recent discoveries at the University of Chicago revealed the opportunity to treat hyperoxaluria through novel peptides that require local action in the intestine. Thus, a unique peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticle drug delivery system can enable a first-in-class therapeutic for the millions of patients with hyperoxaluria. More importantly, this drug system opens the door for additional orally administered, locally delivered, peptide therapeutics for other difficult gastrointestinal conditions, creating substantial healthcare and economic gains.

    This STTR project is developing an innovative drug delivery system consisting of peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles (PLHN) as a vehicle to deliver novel peptides to the intestinal epithelium, ultimately enabling a first-in-class oral pill to prevent and treat hyperoxaluria and related kidney stones (KS). Once delivered, the nanoparticles will adhere to the intestinal mucosa and slowly release the peptides, stimulating intestinal oxalate secretion, thereby lowering plasma and urine oxalate and hence preventing KS formation. Such delivery will enable peptides to immediately act on the intestinal epithelium to induce oxalate secretion, before being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, mimicking the behavior of a gut bacteria, from which peptides were derived. Research objectives are: 1. Develop PLHN for sustained and localized delivery of peptides to the intestinal epithelium. Peptide release kinetics will be quantified to ensure a 4-week release duration. 2. Show that the PLHN, given rectally as enemas and orally by gavage, will deliver the peptides to the intestinal epithelium in a localized/sustained manner, and that they will significantly reduce plasma and urine oxalate levels in hyperoxalemic and hyperoxaluric mice. Showing dosing once every 3 days similarly reduces urine and plasma oxalate levels compared to twice daily dosing will demonstrate sustained releasability.
