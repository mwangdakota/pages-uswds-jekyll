    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the prevalence of severe diabetic foot ulcers. These ulcers affect one-fourth of patients with diabetes over their lifetimes, significantly impacting mobility and life expectancy. When treatment for an ulcer is too late, the only option is often amputation; in fact, diabetic foot ulcers account for the majority of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Reducing the incidence of severe ulcers will improve the health and welfare of the American public as well as mitigate the economic burden of diabetes on the American healthcare system. By some estimates, treatment for diabetic foot ulcers accounts for one-third of all direct diabetic healthcare spending. Therefore, preventing these ulcers would save the US healthcare system tens of billions of dollars per year. The proposed solution will monitor foot ulcers consistently to prevent further damage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a computer vision system for detecting and monitoring diabetic foot ulcers with an imaging device. The current standard of care is for patients to inspect their own feet visually every day, but these inspections happen inconsistently and unreliably. If successful, this system will automatically identify patients’ feet consistently across several days and lighting conditions. It will classify late-stage wounds, allowing physicians to monitor progression or healing of ulcers. Further, it will estimate the risk of future ulcers, enabling early-stage intervention.

    The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to address critical health, safety, cost and energy challenges in recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) disinfection. Growing high quality protein at larger scales cannot be done with current animal husbandry techniques without generating excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Intensive RAS technologies offer a viable alternative because they are capable of producing high quality protein with minimal impact on the environment.  Protecting the health of the fish is one of the key limitations to a more rapid growth of this industry.  This project will improve food production at scale. Furthermore, the proposed technology may be applied to drinking water.

    This STTR Phase I project will advance a technology for safe and low-energy bacteria disinfection in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) by using a durable, low-cost method to generate singlet oxygen, an excited-state form of molecular oxygen.  Ozone and ultraviolet light are mainstay disinfectants in the fish farm industry, but they are expensive, energy-intensive and can be toxic to fish and personnel; motivating advances in safe, low-energy disinfection.  Singlet oxygen is a powerful disinfecting agent lethal to pathogens and harmless to fish and humans. The primary innovation of this project allows singlet oxygen to be generated at high efficiency without contaminating the water as it is not persistent. This project will conduct engineering studies as a function of both chemical structure and mass transport of reactants and products.  Detailed models will be developed to determine the appropriate dimensions of the disinfection system as well as understand the interactions between singlet oxygen and pathogens.  These models will be the first to couple transport phenomena with absorption/desorption kinetics in this configuration for RAS.

    \ with wide-ranging environmental benefits. The State of Hawaii has legislated\
    \ the replacement of residential cesspools by 2050 in order to reduce the pollution\
    \ in streams and the ocean. Unfortunately, upgrade costs are so high that 90%\
    \ of Hawaiian cesspool owners can’t afford the upgrade. The proposed technology\

    \ Previous investigations into abPBR use for onsite treatment have shown the capacity\

    \ Phase I project is to help restore grassland ecosystems and reduce net greenhouse\

    \ from the group. High stock density/low duration grazing has demonstrated the\
    \ potential of reducing livestock greenhouse emissions and turning rangelands\
    \ into a net carbon sink. Higher vegetation diversity, more water absorption,\
    \ reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the expected ecological\

    \ signals to the other tags in the herd. The tags will use signal strength measurements\
    \ to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will\
    \ then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity\
    \ to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag\
    \ will give an audio alert potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage\
    \ the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide timely and highly localized climate forecasts, plus information such as extreme heat and frost risk, to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Climate forecasting at sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales is challenging, yet essential for proactive risk management of extreme natural hazards.  This project will leverage artificial intelligence and cloud computing to implement a data-intensive approach for revolutionizing global climate forecasting. The project will provide efficient and accurate seasonal forecasts at relatively low computational cost in a user-friendly web environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop a localized, timely, and reliable climate forecasting system that is industry-focused and crop-specific. In this project, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques will be deployed to advance operational climate forecasting skill at a global scale. While conventional forecasts are trained exclusively on observational data, this project will train models on historical simulations and reanalysis, then evaluate them with observations. In this approach, the training dataset is substantially larger, consequently improving accuracy. This processing at scale is enabled with cloud resources.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient semiconductor chips dedicated to solving challenges with many possible outcomes and inherent uncertainty. Such problems are encountered in decision-making, risk management, chip design, drug design, business analytics, machine learning, computing failure rates of manufactured products, pricing complex financial derivatives, resource allocation in 5G networks and financial portfolios. Current methods for addressing these problems are intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed chips would quantify the uncertainty and find suitable solutions to many real-world challenges with faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient methods.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on advancing probabilistic computers for probabilistic computing. Decision-making, econometrics, risk management, chip design, and drug development are not deterministic. By leveraging the natural stochasticity of specific devices, it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of devices otherwise used for the same computational tasks. The proposed computational architecture and pipelining enables improved computational speed, power consumption, and chip manufacturing costs. The goals of this project are two-fold. The first is to deliver 10-1000x improvement in computation speed compared to CPUs and GPUs using the emulation of probabilistic computers on Field Programmable Gate Arrays. The same task will make projections about the performance of the actual probabilistic computer. The second is to quantify how well the probabilistic computer can accommodate semiconductor manufacturing process variations. Controlling such variations is a significant factor in semiconductor manufacturing costs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to increase the diversity of people engaging in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) by broadening the creative and expressive possibilities at the intersection of craft and circuit design.  The project hypothesizes that by creating design and digital fabrication tools that leverage familiar paper craft practices and the intrinsic motivational value the arts, circuit design and fabrication can be made accessible to those who are novices to circuit design and fabrication.  Research shows that this approach is especially successful for reaching those who otherwise may not participate in STEM, especially underrepresented minorities, girls and women. By developing software to support digital circuit design and fabrication, this project enables users to easily share and build off of digital design templates, expanding the reach of beginner-friendly starter projects and creating a community of learners who can co-create and co-teach. Further, by enabling creators to connect circuit design to consumer-friendly digital fabrication technologies like desktop craft cutters, we will bring the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditionally technical environments and into entirely new and more mainstream audiences.

    The technical innovation is the development of novel electrical design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing electronics computer aided design tools, making the tool accessible to novice users such as educators, hobbyists and artists.  This will be done through the elimination of schematic abstractions along with powerful simulation capabilities uniquely catered for expressive and artistic technological creations.  By combining beginner-appropriate electronic footprints with a drawing interface for sketching traces, users will be able to represent their designs exactly as they would appear when built.  By incorporating electrical rule checks along with simulation of circuit behavior, the software will allow users to iterate on their designs with confidence before they invest time in fabricating. To address these challenges, the design of the software and accompanying physical toolkit will be designed iteratively and in close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters through a series of user studies to ensure that the intended audience who have never used electronic design software before can manufacture their designs easily while being able to express their diverse interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase aquaculture productivity by reducing disease impact. Disease costs billions in losses each year to the aquaculture industry and threatens the global food supply. The disease caused by White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) can devastate a shrimp farm and costs over $1 billion in losses each year. Farmers are often unaware of a disease issue until animals show advanced signs of disease or there are mortalities. Laboratory diagnosis is expensive and results take days-to-weeks, which is often far too long for results to be actionable. Early warning of white spot disease can enable farmers to take immediate action to reduce losses, reducing costs and increasing industrial robustness.  This project advances a new diagnostic to quickly, easily, and reliably detect WSSV in cultivated shrimp in a new easy-to-use, on-site test.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance translation of a novel diagnostic for WSSV in a technology incorporating engineered proteins with specific targets into a paper-based biosensor. Prior studies demonstrated proof-of-concept with a paper-based immunoassay with polymerization-based amplification for detection of protein-based biomarkers for HRP2–the primary protein biomarker of malaria–with sensitivity as low as 70pM. This project will bioengineer thermostable rcSso7d DNA-binding proteins to bind the WSSV target and incorporate them into the paper testing format. Assay sensitivity, reagent composition, and dynamic range will be explored as part of an effort to understand the biological and functionally meaningful limits of the developed assay. Tasks include a WSSV challenge study to evaluate the sampling parameters and detection limits of the prototype in laboratory cultured shrimp. The resulting prototype will rapidly and selectively bind the WSSV target and yield stable, easily interpretable, colorimetric results.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the proposed SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications) prototype, designed as a best-in-class pressure, temperature, and seismic sensor system to be incorporated into new global submarine fiber optic cable networks. The expected commercial impacts are significant, as the customer base for SMART technology includes commercial submarine cable suppliers, government monitoring agencies, scientific consortia and agencies, and internet content providers. The development and deployment of SMART will enhance scientific understanding of Earth’s oceans, seafloor, and subsurface via a fundamentally new approach to long-term subsea sensor network deployments. SMART will therefore provide essential new data to reduce disaster risk and improve global climate understanding, thereby reducing societal and environmental vulnerabilities to these long- and short-term threats.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop the first integrated SMART prototype system. This innovative real-time deep ocean monitoring technology will catalyze fundamental improvements in Tsunami Early Warning (TEW), Earthquake Early Warning (EEW), global climate monitoring and telecommunications resiliency.  The innovation is to tightly integrate sensors into the amplifiers (“repeaters”) used to boost signals in the optical fibers. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components will be utilized for nearly all physical elements of the system. The sensor assembly includes a 3-axis accelerometer, absolute pressure gauge, and temperature sensor, integrated with data acquisition circuits with suitable dynamic range and precision, a common communications module, an interface suitable for fiber optic cable spans up to 120 km in length, software and firmware necessary to support the data path, an isolated power source, and precision timing. The SMART repeater design is modular, allowing different sensors, adaptation to different repeater housings, or use as a standalone unit. Technical hurdles to be addressed include hardware development and integration, software development, data acquisition and processing, power management, communications bandwidth, and delivery of precision time and frequency references.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a tool that will streamline the clinical trial process, reducing time and money spent without sacrificing safety or an understanding of a treatment’s efficacy. Medical treatments do not work equally well on all patients. Finding a responsive population on which to perform a study directly impacts the likelihood of a new therapy’s success while minimizing risk to patients who would see little or no benefit. The tool will allow clinical trials to be run virtually as computer programs in software that simulates human physiology. This technology will be valuable at all stages of treatment development: suggesting new therapies, testing for adverse effect, planning clinical trials, interpreting trial results, and predicting results when a new therapy is introduced outside of the clinical trial.  This project is focused initially on the development of a critical under-represented population: older black men with hypertension and associated diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Simulations of specific populations will allow researchers and clinicians to anticipate issues, enabling more effective treatment plans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a virtual population of 50-70 year old hypertensive African-American men with and without common cardiovascular comorbidities including congestive heart failure and type II diabetes. The virtual patients will be instantiations of a differential-algebraic model of human physiology, reflecting interactions between factors such as hormone concentrations, electrolytes, and more.  The virtual population will be generated from clinical data collected from other studies and the approach can be used for other specific populations who may be historically under-represented in trials.  This model can be used to estimate responses to clinical interventions (device and pharmaceutical therapies) to inform treatment development and further trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the enabling capabilities in applications that call for both in-air and underwater operations. The aerial-underwater drones are the first drones that can fly in air, swim in water, and transition swiftly between air and water. This project aims to equip the drones with video transmission capabilities through underwater acoustic communication so that the drone need not be tethered to operate underwater. With the enabling capabilities, the drone is useful in critical infrastructure mapping, coastal environment monitoring, emergency response, coastal surveillance, and search and rescue operations.  The underwater video transmission technology can also be applied to other platforms to extend underwater wireless and mobile internet.  The capability, in turn, has the potential to enable Internet of Underwater Things. The commercial potential of the project addresses the pain points of the existing products:  the low data rate and large form factor.  The enhanced drone will enable the hybrid vehicle to create a new market that is unserved by either Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design and prototype a small form factor acoustic communication system for aerial-underwater drones enabling them to achieve high data-rate video transmission over underwater wireless links. The intellectual merits of the proposed acoustic communication system include: 1) real-time hardware implementation of a novel MIMO (multiple-input-multiple-output) transmitter on an embedded GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) such that the system can be powered by battery and be fit in a small water-proof container, 2) real-time hardware implementation of a Turbo equalization receiver on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform to combat the huge Doppler spread and long multipath echoes of acoustic channels, 3) video transmission by a high information data rate of more than 300 kbps over underwater acoustic links, and 4) integration of the small form factor acoustic transmitter with the aerial-underwater drones without interfering with the operation of the drones.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable surgeons to see lymph nodes directly during cancer surgeries to (1) improve the quality-of-care for lung cancer, rectal cancer, and some gynecological cancers; and (2) save costs for hospitals by accelerating a time-consuming and potentially inaccurate step in cancer surgeries; (3) improve hospital accreditation performance, since lymph node number is a quality metric and many hospitals fail to meet the requirements stipulated by medical authorities. Decades of clinical evidence have shown evaluating lymph nodes is linked to higher survival rates for cancer patients. This project will develop a device to be seamlessly integrated into the existing surgical protocols and used as an accessory to existing laparoscopic towers and surgical robots. Any cancer hospital will be able to purchase this device, attach it to their existing towers or surgical robots, and improve their quality of care, surgery efficiency, and accreditation performance immediately at an affordable price.

    The proposed project addresses a difficult and common problem in surgical oncology – finding lymph nodes in cancer surgeries. Lymph nodes are critically important in the context of cancer because they are the channels for cancers to spread. However, lymph nodes are translucent in color and surrounded by fat, also translucent, making it difficult to find them with current optical systems. This project aims to develop a label-free optical imaging device to visualize lymph nodes with high contrast in real time without any injection. The goals of this project are to (1) build an accessory device attachable to a commercially available laparoscopic tower, (2) obtain optical performance testing results from animal carcasses, and (3) obtain optical performance testing results from cadaver specimens.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is related to the use of a patient’s own fat tissue for repair after injury or surgery. Removing tissue to eliminate damage through disease or trauma is universally followed by repairing tissue to restore form and function. While a broad range of materials are available, the use of a patient’s own fat for these procedures has long been considered an obvious option. Fat can be safely harvested, is rich in stem cells and growth factors and has other desirable properties, depending on the location from which it is harvested. The use of this material for surgical procedures has been inhibited by a loss of specific physical properties during the harvesting procedure. Providing a matrix to reconstruct these properties is likely to render fat grafting a more commonplace procedure. By optimizing structure and formulation of this matrix material, tissue engineering can be disrupted with an off-the-shelf option enabling harvested fat from a patient to address the hundreds of thousands of reconstructive procedures undertaken each year.

    The proposed project is based on the use of elastin-based recombinant proteins to address the current limitations of tissue repair scaffolds. The proposed technology uses highly disordered proteins to produce defined 3D structures to replicate mechanical and biological activities of the body. Using iterative design and molecular engineering, the team has generated a new class of biomaterials that are uniquely suited to meet the key criteria for a fat grafting support matrix, including injectability, in vivo phase transition to a firm solid, and biocompatibility to allow cellular viability and vascularization. This project focuses on optimization of the matrix for reconstruction procedures, including facial, breast, amputation sites and foot pad tissues. A range of materials with unique biomechanical properties are likely required to address each of the target use cases.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the loss of fresh produce due to microbial spoilage during its journey from farm to consumer. These food losses amount to $200 billion per year in direct costs worldwide, as well as an increase the environmental footprint of food production systems.  The food spoilage also causes additional potential damage to the environment and human health due to the increased use of synthetic pesticides and preservatives in an effort to prevent loss. This project aims to reduce food spoilage and the unintended consequences by providing safe, effective, and environmentally responsible methods for managing food crops post-harvest.

    The proposed project focuses on the development of controlled release systems to deliver naturally occurring, safe, anti-fungal essential oil compound (EOC) vapors to protect perishable agricultural produce from spoilage. Several experimental systems have been reported in the literature for the controlled release delivery of the EO vapors but no commercialized solutions yet exist. This highlights the importance of focused research and development needed to develop these EO delivery systems. Concurrently with controlled release systems investigations, crucial testing and modeling capabilities both in house and in an external network are also being developed. These include various volatile quantitation techniques ranging from photoionization detectors (PIDs) to gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) instruments, test beds, and dynamic and finite element modeling of transport phenomena.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of animal-free meat alternatives. Today, plant-based meats are consumed mostly by vegans and vegetarians willing to accept higher costs or different tastes compared with meat from animals. Recently, plant-based burgers and sausages have become popular, but the situation is very different for whole-cut meats. Steaks or chicken breasts, for example, have unique textures and tastes that are not yet matched by animal-free alternatives. The proposed project will improve the texture of alternative meats and provide a path to improved nutrition, taste, and aroma.

    The proposed project addresses a limitation of plant-based meats: they lack the distinct fibrous texture found in natural meats. This project advances ultrafine protein fibers with similar structure to animal muscle fibers. Project aims include ultrafine protein fiber production, development of sterile bioreactor systems to house fiber scaffolds for tissue engineering, and feasibility studies of culturing a variety of agriculturally relevant animal cells in the fiber scaffold bioreactors. The first project aim will overcome the technical hurdle of producing edible protein fibers using scalable food-safe processes. The deliverable for Aim 1 will be edible fibrous protein scaffolds with textures approximating meats. Project Aim 2 will evaluate perfusion systems to securely house scaffolds under sterile conditions conducive to cell culture. The deliverable for Aim 2 will be reusable custom tissue culture chambers. Project Aim 3 will compare a selection of animal cells based on their proliferation rates and viability when cultured in our fibrous tissue engineering scaffolds. The deliverable for Aim 3 will be animal cell-based muscle and/or fat tissues.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.

    The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will be a safe endovascular detoxification device for treatment of numerous acute and chronic pathologies. The proposed device could aid in the treatment of severe autoimmune disease patients and organ transplant patients, and furthermore, would clear up a path for safe use of viral gene therapy in the general population. It has the potential to decrease mortality and reduce the burden on the global healthcare expenditure for the widespread antibody-mediated pathological conditions. There is a societal need for a safe, cost-effective, fast-acting, widely-accessible, and easy-to-use system capable of rapid blood detoxification for treatment of pathological conditions. The markets targeted by the proposed device include the multibillion-dollar autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and viral gene therapy markets, with the largest market opportunity being the global autoimmune disease therapeutics market that is expected to reach $153.3 billion by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development an endovascular blood IgG detoxification platform for rapid elimination of IgG antibodies for treatment of IgG-driven pathological conditions.  Antibody-mediated immune response has been a key factor responsible for numerous acute and chronic pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejections, immune-mediated rejection in viral gene therapy. Currently, therapeutic apheresis and potent systemic immunosuppressives have been the main forms of management for IgG-driven pathologies. However, these forms of treatments are not patient-friendly, and in many cases do more harm than good. The proposed endovascular blood IgG detoxification device could potentially provide safe and rapid elimination of circulating IgGs, eliminating the need for unfavorable or in cases harmful treatments such as therapeutic apheresis or potent systemic immunosuppressives. The device will be comprehensively investigated in an ex vivo venous simulation system, testing its hemocompatibility, IgG-elimination capacity, and the influence of different parameters including rod material, rod diameter, rod length, flow rate, and therapeutic protein concentration. Furthermore, the safety, durability, immune response, and therapeutic efficacy of the device will be investigated in a lethal IgG-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) model in minipigs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the research and development of an intelligent, immersive, virtual reality (VR) platform for remote physical therapy and patient monitoring. This innovation enhances biomechanical analysis to facilitate telerehabilitation through off-the-shelf consumer VR head-mounted displays in patient homes and clinics, effectively providing a means for in-patient success metrics and full-body exercise guidance using a centralized, remote virtual platform. Such technology may have the ability to enable greater affordability, accessibility, and accuracy of physical therapy for patients and therapists alike. Patient throughput could potentially be doubled through remote visits in virtual environments and automated physical health documentation. In addition, the platform will be designed to support therapists working in marginalized communities of "medical deserts," where patients are uninsured and care is significantly limited by hospital capacity, physical distance, doctors per population, and cost. This software-as-a-service immersive physical therapy platform may reach a projected annual revenue of $2.08M USD. With remote tools and predictive physical therapy analytics, more individuals will receive access to treatment regardless of their socio-economic and demographic background.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an immersive virtual reality environment where therapists can meet their patient in a 3D virtual clinic and use the platform's tools to aid in patient evaluation. This technology addresses the shortcomings of widely used current telehealth platforms (most often videoconferencing) where therapists find it difficult to perform common evaluations such as movement abilities and balance coordination tests.  The goal of this project is to build an updated machine learning algorithm with integration on the virtual platform to enable therapists to remotely evaluate their patients with high accuracy biomechanical metrics.  The goal is to achieve remote rehabilitation of patients that is comparable to that of in-person patient rehabilitation. In addition, pilot research will be performed with healthcare organizations to assess this technology in providing patient success metrics and exercise interaction through commercial head-mounted display virtual reality systems. This technology has the potential to positively change a consumer's physical therapy experience by significantly reducing traditional clinical and insurance costs, enabling remote access for populations of low-socioeconomic backgrounds, alleviating discomfort for patients, and increasing remote recovery insights.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project will address the provision of safe water to our global population.  In high income nations, high-quality drinking water is provided through centralized water-treatment/distribution systems.  For 2-3 billion people in lower income countries, clean drinking water is not a guarantee.  They must collect and store household water, often in open containers without disinfectant.  The consequences of these deficiencies include the consumption of unsafe water that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality from water-related diseases.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that one possible solution to this problem is to decentralize water treatment so that people treat their water right before they consume it in their homes (e.g. point-of-use water treatment).  However, designing point-of-use water treatment technologies is a challenging problem that requires the product to be technologically effective, simple to use, inexpensive, and socially acceptable.  This project will develop a disruptive technology for point-of-use water treatment and will meet these rigorous design criteria.  The technology has the potential to improve water quality, human health, and quality of life for millions of people around the world while employing US citizens for manufacturing and sales of the product.

    This project seeks to develop and test methods to apply metallic copper and an N-halamine coating to the surface of a porous ceramic tablet for household water purification in lower income countries.  The resulting tablet will effectively disinfect viruses, bacteria, and protozoa in 10-20 liters of stored household water for one year (over 7000 liters total) with a cost of less than 0.3 cents per liter.  Copper salt solution will be reduced through high-temperature heating to form microscopic clusters of metallic copper.  When added to water, the copper will oxidize to release copper ions into solution to cause pathogen disinfection. This component will be combined with an existing technology that releases silver ions from a porous ceramic tablet.  The synergistic effects of these disinfectants may enable 1-3-star certification from the World Health Organization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to broaden access to healthcare data. Users of the system developed in this project can take biometric measurements such as heart rate, muscle-activity, and body mass calculations in real-time, with data collected through sensors embedded into clothing.  The innovation enables vital measurements to be taken, both inside and outside of clinical environments, while reducing instrumentation weight and cost requirements. This fabric-based technology can potentially serve users ranging from medical professionals to everyday consumers who will more easily adopt wearable soft-material products in lieu of traditional hardware devices. Specialized sectors such as physical therapy, pre-surgical studies, sports labs, and out-patient care have the highest growth opportunity for new technology adoption. Complementing the rapid growth of telehealth, bio-sensing capabilities for real-time and remote tracking will improve patient compliance and aid health care workers by providing better access to comprehensive vital measurement data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves material science research in conductive threads and fabrics. These soft goods can bend, stretch, and compress along the body where they are worn. In addition, their electromechanical characteristics allow them to pick up small voltage and current signals that are naturally generated from the body, specifically from the heart, muscles, and the brain. By strategically weaving these materials within a shirt, small voltages for EKG (heart), EMG (muscle), EEG (brain), and BIA (water and body mass content) can be simultaneously captured and measured for heart rate, muscle activity, brain activity, and water and fat content measurements. The technical research will involve innovation in fabric-materials optimized for small signal and low noise pickup and design of a comfortable garment incorporating multiple fabric-based electrodes for simultaneous pickup of EKG/EMG/BIA signals. The project will also develop new signal processing algorithms to transform raw voltages to real-time signals transmitted wirelessly. The desired technical result is a functional and wearable prototype with end-to-end communication from the fabric through the garment to a receiving mobile or desktop app visualizing the processed data for heart rate, muscle activity, and body mass analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of life for people who suffer from debilitating forms of paralysis by restoring their lost functionality. There are 5.4 million people in the United States who suffer from paralysis. Not only do these patients suffer from the physical pain that comes with their condition but also, they are afflicted by financial and psychological burdens. The prostheses that are being used today are either passive and affordable or active and unaffordable for the majority of these patients. Active prostheses represent the forefront of brain-computer interfaces development. Current protheses suffer from drawbacks such as constant patient training, the necessity for bulky skin electrodes, variability in electrode positioning, and limited efficacy when worn and operated by the patients themselves. This device first targets incomplete paralysis by functioning as a neural relay station that bridges the disconnect between the healthy neural section above and below the site of injury.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the limitations of current brain-computer interfaces to not only restore functionality in people with paralysis, but to recreate a real-time, seamless experience for them. Most available neural probes rely on highly invasive, sharp shanks to penetrate neural tissue.  These probes cause considerable inflammation, ultimately leading to device failure. Current devices detect signals extracellularly which leads to a  low signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction very challenging. This project will improve brain-computer interfaces by introducing nanoarchitecture to the sensing electrode in order to achieve intracellular sensing. This sensing dramatically increases the signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction considerably simpler. This device is based on an active pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor architecture which will turn neural signals into a string of ones and zeros making signal extraction considerably simpler. This process will minimize the patient-interface training time. This project will fabricate three-dimensional, nano-architected sensing electrodes with high-aspect ratio and high-density nanoneedles, mimicking the natural neural cell environment. The nanoneedles spontaneously penetrate neurons, achieve superior intracellular recording, and reduce chronic inflammation to promote device longevity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is ultimately to increase the representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) employment areas, enabling the US to meet the increasing demand for STEM workers and maintain competitiveness in the global innovation community. Factors promoting underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM often take effect early in education and extend beyond traditional classrooms settings; this solution specifically addresses the support needed by parents in order to facilitate STEM informal learning in a way that is particularly engaging for their young daughters. This proposed project, based on evidence-based research in learning in informal environments, will deliver monthly personalized informal learning plans to enable parents to catalyze positive STEM experiences for girls early in their learning journeys so that they are more likely to embrace STEM careers and better positioned to secure them in the future.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform the way young girls perceive and engage in STEM career exploration by providing a progressive playlist of STEM informal learning experiences personalized to their unique interests. This is accomplished through a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven recommender system that learns from user preferences and attributes to recommend content and learning experiences, which are meant to increase STEM confidence and interest for young girls as well as inspire their curiosity. Parents can opt to provide immediate feedback on the recommended plan that further tunes the plan to their child’s needs or swap selections with secondary recommendations. The proposed project’s objectives are to develop and test algorithmic model for sequenced recommendations, design and build the prototype application, and conduct research to determine that personalized recommendation sequences deepen and/or expand STEM knowledge and interests. To guide the development, efficacy of the recommender will be assessed by comparing results from conducting studies using human recommendations with results using the AI recommender. Once the algorithmic model is established, pre and post assessments will be conducted to assess impact of the intervention on engagement and curiosity with STEM, thereby contributing to an increase in knowledge in the field as well as a commercially applicable and timely marketplace product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make it possible for astrophysicists to dramatically expand their ability to collect the spectra of distant galaxies, and so to advance their understanding of the universe. The most important factor in large-scale spectrographic data collection is the number of spectra taken per viewing hour. The planned Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) is mechanically simpler than the current state-of-the-art positioning systems; it will cost less to produce per installed fiber, and it will provide more fibers per unit area than any existing design. The spectra of galaxies is critical to dark energy and dark matter research programs, and these programs address the greatest open questions in astrophysics today. The relative simplicity of the DFPS mechanical components makes it a better choice for spectrographs of tens of thousands of fibers, but also for much smaller arrays of a few hundred fibers, such as could be installed on smaller telescopes. Thus, the DFPS will win a share of the small market for very large spectrographic instruments, but also to create for itself a large market for smaller spectrographic instruments.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a small Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 fibers on a 5-mm grid. Each fiber will provide a 3.6-mm x 3.6-mm range of motion and will be controlled by electronic circuits consuming less than 20 mW. A calibrated camera will view the illuminated fiber tips, monitoring their position with an accuracy of 10 µm, to measure and demonstrate the precision and repeatability of the fiber positioner. The stability of the positioner will be determined over the course an hour in warm and cold environments, and in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The direct method of fiber movement requires accurate control of voltages applied to many fibers in parallel, which is a challenging electrical engineering problem that has been avoided by other, mechanically complex systems. If we can locate fibers with an accuracy of 10 µm in the focal plane of a telescope, we will be able to provide a new and superior type of fiber-positioner, one that will be more compact, less vulnerable to mechanical failure, less susceptible to corrosion, and more resistant to fatigue than any other existing fiber-positioning system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to apply low-cost radiofrequency (RF) sensing hardware to detect, monitor, and localize transmitters in industrial and urban environments. This technology can solve key problems in manufacturing and logistics operations such as finding RF transmitters that are interfering with operations or monitoring the health of radio systems. These activities are required in modern industrial environments as increasing numbers of critical systems rely on radio communications to operate. In urban environments, automating the tasks of detecting, monitoring, and localizing transmitters can simplify the management of large-scale radio networks and gather critical data on wireless device usage. Increased instances of intentional jamming and the rollout of new communications standards such as 5G make these tasks critical to the modern city. Traditionally, such monitoring tasks are conducted manually with expensive spectrum monitoring equipment. Automated installations also utilize expensive sensors, making automated spectrum monitoring only feasible in safety-critical areas such as around airports. Lower-cost sensors can be installed permanently at a high density for almost any application, allowing cities and smaller industrial customers to deploy persistent monitoring networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy high-density networks of low-cost sensors, determine the efficacy of existing detection and localization algorithms as applied to the network, and evaluate novel machine-learning (ML) algorithms for similar tasks. This project will also mitigate the technical risk of deploying such a system by characterizing how well commodity software-defined radio (SDR) hardware can perform across a variety of operational environments. No high-density and large-scale test networks of inexpensive radio hardware have been deployed for the purposes of industrial and urban spectrum monitoring, so data gathered throughout this SBIR Phase I project will be useful in evaluating the viability of this approach. By evaluating ML algorithms for signal detection and localization, this project can help determine how effective machine learning models can be at ingesting RF data from low-cost sensors and synthesizing actionable outputs about the radio environment. The result of this project will be an analysis of the detection and localization performance of a variety of algorithms across different environments and sensor node densities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate a transformative augmented/mixed-reality smart glass to enable new immersive digital spaces. The high-performance implementation of the technology developed here will be used to augment users' perception and understanding of information and images. The remote and virtual human-to-human interactions can be enhanced through these user-natural augment/mixed-reality smart glasses beyond the smartphone. This next-generation mobile display more seamlessly interfaces with online content available today and in already established networks, ranging from online retail, gaming, sports immersion, entertainment, and social networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops smart glasses for augmented/mixed-reality digital spaces beyond the smartphone. Current smart glasses are typically based on conventional holographic or diffractive optical elements which have significant physical and performance limitations, preventing their wide-spread adoption. This project develops metasurface waveguides to achieve the key performance metrics of resolution, field-of-view, efficiency and optical element integration in augmented/mixed-reality waveguides. The metasurface waveguide is finely tuned for high performance specifications collectively, across the full color gamut, and with ease of fabrication and manufacturing scaling. The system is light weight, compact, and integrates with current light sources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (Phase I) project is to reduce human and environmental health risks posed by Harmful Algae Bloom (HABs) impacts to water resources.  Communities across the nation allocate substantial financial resources to address HABs in their water bodies as HABs can be extremely toxic. However, this ecological problem can be treated as an eco-mining opportunity because HABs are tiny eco-miners that scour, collect, and concentrate excess nutrients in water bodies. The proposed technology is an eco-sensitive mining technology designed to harvest, trap, and permanently remove these HABs, their toxins, and the often ore-grade concentration of nutrients they contain. This project will advance a technology to permanently and sustainably removing the HABs, their toxins and the excess nutrients they contain. As a fully scalable and rapidly deployable, cost-effective technology, it will rapidly resolve HAB impairments and related health risks.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed project is to target HABs, trap them through mechanical filtration, separate them through flotation, and monitor and test the effluent water for toxins. The proposed research is focused on development of remote and automatic operation capabilities to further minimize potential contact with HABs.   The process can be deployed in less than one day to surround and control small or very large areas of HABs, does not require a land-based treatment area, and does not need electricity or high capacity pumping systems to work. It can trap and remove HABs actively or passively.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology that will reduce intraoperative nerve damage using fluorescence imaging to enable surgeons to see the unseen. Intraoperative nerve injury is a major complication of surgery, affecting all specialties and often causing irreparable damage. Nerve damage occurs in ~17% of all surgeries and intraoperative nerve injuries affect 50 million patients annually worldwide, incurring undue pain, loss of function, and high costs to the healthcare system. Currently, no clinically approved technology exists to enhance intraoperative nerve recognition - surgeons rely solely on anatomical knowledge and visualization. The proposed project will finalize development of first-in-kind nerve targeted substance allowing surgeons to “cut by color” – identifying and sparing nerves more effectively to reduce these complications and the associated costs, estimated at $12.5 billion annually.

    The proposed project is focused on the development of near-infrared nerve-specific fluorophores for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) that are clinically viable for translation to human studies. Recent work has allowed modification of the base structures of the fluorophores to significantly improve brightness, solubility, and toxicity while maintaining high nerve specificity. The immediate milestones of the work proposed herein include (1) characterization of a library of benzo[c]phenoxazine small molecule derivatives with chemically tuned water solubility and quantified nerve specificity, (2) elucidation of the biological target and mechanistic understanding of nerve-specificity for the fluorophores, (3) preliminary single-dose toxicology analysis in rodents, (4) quantified pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution to determine the optimal imaging dose and time window, and (5) identification of a lead compound for clinical translation. Successful completion of the proposed work will enable selection of a lead candidate with a proven safety profile and bright, long-lasting (~1 hour) nerve-specific fluorescence for identification of buried nerve structures at up to 1 cm depths.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of improved thermal cooling solutions for mobile devices.  Cooling solutions today are often unable to meet the demands of 5G/6G telecommunications with thermal heating rates up to 10 times that of 4G technologies. Even current high performance 5G mobile phones have greatly increasing thermal loads, which, in turn, increase the external touch temperature of the smart phone and often trigger the phone to slow down its speed. The proposed technology may result in improved cooling for increased performance without limitations of performance throttling.  Enhancing thermal cooling capabilities of cutting edge mobile devices may help enable widespread adoption of 5G/6G telecommunications, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and big data applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a new passive micro-two-phase cooling based on pulsating heat pipes, which consist of a loop of microchannels in a flat plate in which oscillations of the coolant in the serpentine are generated by vapor bubbles to pump liquid and vapor to transport higher heat loads.  The design harnesses complex self-induced pulsations to better perform the work of transferring larger quantities of heat by enhancing the pulsating heat pipe's fluid motion with localized obstructions to create distributed bubble nucleation points. The same obstructions will be used to improve the micro-thermal heat transfer processes. The project introduces microfluidics to pulsating heat pipes.  The research objectives of the proposed project are to demonstrate substantial improvements in thermal performance compared to competing cooling technology (vapor chambers) at the same thin form factors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be improvement of quality of life and reduction of healthcare costs associated with tendon and ligament injuries which are notoriously difficult and slow to heal, depriving millions of Americans years of productivity. Tendon and ligament injuries are especially debilitating for the aged, the active or those with physically demanding professions. Injured ligaments (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament)  or tendons (e.g. Achilles) require months of rehabilitation and can take up to a year to heal. In the elderly, rotator cuff injuries are pernicious, prevalent and refractory to treatment. Every year in the US, $130 billion is spent on musculoskeletal injury-related medical visits, 60% of which are tendon and ligament injuries. Tendon and ligament injuries result in 288 million lost work days costing the US economy $50 billion annually. In spite of decades of effort, there has been very little improvement in either the rate or the quality of healing for these injuries. The injectable repair system proposed could reduce healing time and improve repair quality. The proposed plan to drastically reduce the cost of the raw materials through human cell engineering will make the treatment solution universally affordable.

    The proposed project will determine the feasibility of an entirely new approach to tendon and ligament repair based upon the in vivo delivery and assembly of collagen monomers into the path of force. The approach is derivative of two recent innovations that will be combined in four objectives to produce an injectable collagen-based solution designed to accelerate the repair of damaged connective tissues (i.e. ligaments and tendons) the healing of which presents a significant medical challenge. The first innovation is the use of CRISPR/CAS9 technology which will be used to accelerate the production of collagen by human fibroblasts. Objective 1 will to optimize the CRISPR process and scale it up through isolation and expansion of cells receptive to enhanced collagen production. Objective 2 will leverage the second major innovation, liquid crystal collagen processing technology, to develop a shelf stable injectable solution of highly-dense particulates that is expected to donate large amounts of collagen to injured connective tissue. Objective 3 will demonstrate that the injectable repair solution will deliver collagen to repair damage in vitro and Objective 4 will apply the approach in vivo, to demonstrate that exogenous collagen delivery can speed the repair of damaged, living tendon.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that poisoning by prescription drugs affects over one million people annually and is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Other than opioids, prescribed benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants are the most common causes of accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. Drug testing plays a central role in the detection and management of poisoned patients, and the ability to rapidly identify the cause and institute prompt targeted treatment has the potential to reduce morbidity and save lives. Currently, screening of blood and other biological fluids for toxic drug levels requires specimen processing, taking hours or days to obtain results from commercial laboratories. Immediate, accurate, low-cost testing for urgent care in the ambulance or emergency room will improve outcomes for the rapid diagnosis and care of patients after accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. The biosensor device and drug testing methods described in this project can be performed for low cost at the first point of contact and are scalable for rapid commercial and clinical adoption into a global drug screening market valued at $1.1 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a new solid-state biosensor device reporting real-time and accurate quantification of toxic drug levels in the blood using inexpensive, disposable test strips similar to a diabetes glucometer or from saliva like a sublingual electronic thermometer. Current drug toxicity assays use specialized laboratory methods that require blood sample processing and can take hours to days to obtain results. Biosensors are an interface between biology and electronics that convert specific chemical information into measurable electronic signals (e.g. a glucometer). The three specific outcomes of this project will be; 1) a handheld medical device providing accurate and real-time measurement of blood levels of all classes of antipsychotic, neuroleptic, and anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use, and other common drugs of abuse, from a drop of blood or saliva, 2) validation of the accuracy of the biosensor for target drugs relative to current laboratory analysis methods (e.g., mass spectroscopy), and 3) demonstration that the biosensor can distinguish between classes of medications, drugs of abuse, and potential clinical interferents in blood using specific analytical methods and modifiable biosensor coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the challenges posed to the US healthcare system resulting from neurologic disease and trauma impacting 100+ million patients in the US alone and associated costs in excess of $1.3 trillion, driven by a lack of diagnostic tools detecting the onset of disease before it affects neuronal tissue beyond repair. Neurologic biomarkers represent a promising new approach to this challenge, comprising 10% of the $53 billion global biomarker market and growing at a 14.5% compound annual growth rate. This Phase I project aims to provide neurologic biomarker-based low-cost blood testing products for research and patient care, providing novel diagnostic information. It is anticipated that changes from baselines resulting from concussions, onset of dementia, brain tumors or neurologic disease, can be detected early, thereby allowing for timely intervention.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is based on the finding that specific immune cells (phagocytes) in the peripheral blood can serve as diagnostic indicators of brain health. It is well established that these cells are recruited to the injured or diseased brain in order to clear the cellular debris resulting from the inflammatory response. While current methods seek to identify neurologic biomarkers in blood serum, where they are very dilute and difficult to detect, this project aims to make use of the finding that debris-loaded cells can reenter the blood stream.  The proposed project will develop technologies and instrumentation to capture and quantify these phagocytes from small amounts of blood (e.g. finger prick), to identify the specific cell types involved, and assay their brain-specific biomarker content. Since the normal protein turnover affects the brain as well, blood samples from cognitively normal donors will be tested to establish a baseline concentration of these biomarker-carrying phagocytes and their cargo.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand access to quality health care for underserved populations.  The proposed project develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant, women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example. The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips. Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules, such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the paper lateral flow strips.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to help applications of augmented reality, location-based search, and real-time live mapping of the world, and to build a digital twin of the earth. Event information is dynamic and hyperlocal. Thus it is important to ground the location and time of events to real GPS coordinates and universal time. This creates technical challenges of entity disambiguation and resolution, and real-time processing event information to reflect last-minute changes. The proposed natural language grounding work also helps create a mirrorworld with information interlinked between the virtual internet and physical spaces and events.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the first to investigate neural language model pre-training over semi-structured hypertext on a web scale (55TB of compressed data monthly). This will greatly accelerate understanding of noisy web text, while the majority of research to date has been conducted on clean plain text only. This project will also attack the challenge of machine reading with document-level annotations in a semi-supervised fashion, while the predominance of study has been carried out with more precise word-level annotation in a fully supervised way. The technical goal of this project is to create a scalable infrastructure that allows quick iterations of mining web scale data, and an ensemble of algorithms that are adapted to learning structured information over hypertext. It is an unsolved challenge for most small businesses that in the past only the internet giants have attempted. The resulting machine learning algorithms will be capable of interpreting semi-structured web data, in contrast to typical structured annotation to understand hypertext.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project falls within the larger scope of expanding artificial intelligence (AI) methods into health care applications. The application is focused on image guided endovascular surgical procedures for intracranial aneurysms (IA), which may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most devastating type of hemorrhagic stroke. The current trends in treatment of aneurysms show that endovascular approach has become the mainstay procedure due to reduced surgical complications when compared with open skull surgery. Despite tremendous technological advances in devices and surgical instrumentation, as many as 30% of these lesions are not completely healed after the first surgical intervention, exposing patients to additional risks for complications due to multiple surgical procedures. The AI autonomous solution developed in this project will be the one of the first applications that provides intraoperative prognosis for six-month healing of an aneurysm after each surgical step to allow surgical adjustments, reducing the risk for ruptures and re-treatments from 30% to an estimated 5% and creating savings for the $65,000 in retreatments (roughly $1.95 B annually in the U.S.).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will aim to develop a comprehensive and autonomous AI method that will provide intraoperative prognosis of complete healing for an IA at six months. In current clinical practice, neuro-interventionalists cannot guarantee successful healing of intracranial aneurysms immediately post-device placement. Treated patients have to wait a minimum of 3-6 months before their aneurysm is reassessed on medical imaging and the clinician decides if re-treatment is needed. During this critical time, patients are still at risk of rupture. In addition, re-treatments have higher risk to the patient as well as bear a financial burden on hospitals and insurance companies. The proposed algorithms will be fully integrated with surgical equipment and will allow dynamic angiographic analysis to derive physics-based parameters related to the nature of blood flow inside the aneurysm sac. These parameters are combined with a machine learning algorithm to provide a prediction as to whether the treatment is sufficient for a full healing.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable novel binary code AI applications for cybersecurity, by providing a fast and accurate method to reverse-engineer executable code. Current solutions are slow and inaccurate, and the volume of code analyzed by cybersecurity applications is huge.  Cybersecurity companies either deploy tremendous computing resources to handle huge volumes of code or only extract superficial features from code for AI models, making those solutions extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  The proposed solution will not only save computing resources but will allow for improved solutions by extracting complex features from executable code and applying more advanced AI models.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides an innovative disassembly solution for binary code. The lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. The proposed solution combines state-of-the-art binary analysis techniques and newly emerging deep learning techniques to build a fast and accurate disassembler.  The proposed solution utilizes GPU technology to accelerate the disassembly process.  The final disassembly is expected to be over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art disassemblers, while achieving the same or better accuracy.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to facilitate secure transactions.  The proposed project allows business transactions without the fear of cybercrime.  The expected cost reductions will enable a company to safely engage with individuals and families who cannot afford commonly available cybersecurity solutions. The proposed blockchain process will improve security and resilience of critical infrastructure including energy, transportation, finance, telecommunications, and manufacturing, as well as enabling true smart cities and installations of the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a multi-segment and multipath design for substantial transactional improvement and reduction in required computing resources. Computing resources required in blockchain usage primarily involve the searching of the complete blockchain for the appropriate record. The proposed solution eliminates the required search of the complete blockchain by segmenting the blockchain to search smaller segments.  This project will research, develop and implement a method for improving the current state of knowledge with resulting performance improvement of blockchain transactions without compromising the fidelity of the transaction, thereby eliminating the need for a blockchain Proof of Work Consensus Model. The project will research several blockchains as well as the consensus and non-consensus models for final implementation. Validation includes a baseline transaction measurement for each of the chosen blockchains identified before any modifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a new manufacturing process for on-chip lasers for silicon photonics using printed nanomaterial inks. The difficulty of a scalable method for fabricating on-chip, multi-color lasers is a major challenge for the silicon photonics market. Specifically, today's standard manufacturing of photonic chips does not include on-chip lasers. Without integration of laser engines to drive the circuits, the market potential of light chips is constrained by design and price. The technology developed here can allow foundries to mass produce chips with lasers and open multiple new markets for silicon photonics including wearable photonic sensors, optical data transfer, autonomous vehicle light detection and ranging, quantum information, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and healthcare applications such as immunoassay tests and medical imaging.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops on-chip embedded lasers to enable fully functional silicon photonic chip manufacturing. Currently, the laser solutions being employed in silicon photonics include bonded lasers and heterogeneous integration. The system integrators that assemble silicon photonics modules rely on often cumbersome methods of gluing individual lasers to silicon chips, keeping costs high and throughput well below desired levels. The photonic inks developed here will overcome this challenge by enabling an in-foundry laser solution via wafer-scale additive manufacturing. The photonic ink emits broad-spectrum light covering the visible to the near-infrared range and can be tailored to emit at specific wavelength bands relevant to different markets by altering the number of atomic layers. The goals of this Phase I project are to demonstrate electroluminescence from a p-n junction made from doped, few-layer nanomaterials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve quality control in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The compressed tablet is the most popular pharmaceutical dosage form in use worldwide. Despite its well-established manufacturing processes, issues with tablet quality are frequent. Issues in its design and manufacturing have the potential to make significant medical and financial impacts as failures in quality may result in harm to patients, product recalls, and medicine shortages. The proposed Ultrasonic Measurement Instrument (UMI) unit will substantially shorten drug tablet design/development cycles and detect/identify manufacturing and quality problems before release. Its utilization in modern continuous manufacturing lines will minimize the risk of defective tablet production/disposition and costly product recalls/disposals. The UMI unit will lead to two distinct solutions: (i) a real-time preventive quality monitoring device for continuous manufacturing production line and (ii) a stand-alone laboratory equipment for characterizing tablet physical properties. The target users for our UMI-based products include pharmaceutical manufacturers; equipment providers; generic drug manufacturers; R&D groups and drug development teams in corporations and universities; and compounding pharmacies.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project and its ultrasonic approach have several critical advantages over the competing quality assessment and monitoring technologies for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Unlike other detection techniques, ultrasound directly interacts with the mass density, material elasticity/viscoelasticity, defects/cracks, and inhomogeneities of a medium and piezoelectric transducers are the most sensitive devices for transient strain sensing. Operating in MHz frequency, ultrasonic techniques make rapid (micro-seconds scale) measurements at relevant wavelengths for tablet and defect sizes (micrometer to millimeter scales). Challenges to be addressed include: (i) existing wave propagation models for viscoelastic tablet materials with microstructures are inadequate for accurate materials characterization/valuation with ultrasound, and (ii) a precise handling and positioning apparatus for tablets is needed, as for machine learning and data analytics/mining, the repeatable acquisition and processing of large data sets are required. The main outcome of the project is a proof-of-concept testing/measurement unit (UMI) with a precise tablet handling sub-system and its accompanying mathematical algorithms for the formation of large data sets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to enable doctors to treat previously untreatable cancerous tumors through the development of a smart surgical needle. There are many clinical situations in which a patient cannot receive curative surgery because of the proximity of the tumor to critical anatomy; for example, the central bile duct in liver cancer. In these cases, patients are forced to decide between a number of non-curative treatments that have poor outcomes and significant side effects. Innovation in early-stage tumor treatments will expand treatment options to under-served communities and patient populations. Liver cancer, for example, disproportionately affects Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-American populations in the US, with as many as 30% to 66% patients never receiving any treatment. One reason is that surgical treatments require significant operating room infrastructure (for example, three-dimensional medical imaging) to provide high-quality outcomes; unfortunately these facilities are concentrated in research hospitals and access is not widespread. The technology developed here will address these tumors, and will apply to the more than 600,000 patients in the US yearly that suffer from cancers of the liver, kidney, lung, and breast.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of small-size sensors to transform ablation technology into a first-line treatment for all cancerous tumors. By placing imaging sensors onto the tip of a needle, the device can overcome performance limits encountered when using traditional image guidance. This increased performance, in combination with real-time image analysis, can sense temperature variation in a variety of tissues. The ability to sense temperature variation will be combined with needle tip-based energy delivery to provide an all-in-one closed loop ablation device, with the capability to treat previously untreatable tumors.  This project will demonstrate the application of deep-learning techniques, combined with physics based simulations, to enable precision ablation monitoring.  Subsequently the ablation monitoring will be combined with ablation control to test the feasibility of precise closed-loop ablation in ex vivo tissue with sufficient accuracy for future clinical implementation. This foundational work will then guide the development of the desired needle probe embodiment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the identification of treatments for vascular leak disorders. Uncontrolled vascular leak disorders are common pathological processes that lead to tissue damage across multiple organs and over 60 clinical conditions. Currently, there are no drug-based therapies that address vascular leaks. Available solutions are focused on providing supportive care or decreasing inflammation, without addressing the underlying mechanism. This project is proposing a new approach to repair vascular leaks as a therapeutic intervention. By establishing the first drug discovery workflow for the identification of small molecules that repair vascular leakage, this project will enable the development of a pipeline of drugs for multiple conditions. The first condition targeted will be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which accounts for 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is the leading cause of mortality in ICU. Globally, it affects more than 3 million patients yearly. The proposed solution will decrease the number of deaths and the costs for ICU.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new structure-based drug screening platform designed to identify small molecules that activate the molecular pathways responsible for repairing vascular leakage. The proposed platform consists of a unique combination of novel machine learning methods for ligand-binding site prediction, fast docking algorithm capable of screening ultra-large (over a billion molecule) compound libraries with targeted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profile within minutes (5,000 compounds/second). The AI-guided docking approach is combined with in vitro high-throughput assays measuring the mechanisms of vascular leak in a physiologically relevant microenvironment of human tissues to select candidates targeting vascular leak disorders. In this project, the steps of this tiered workflow will be validated and applied to the first target, leading to the identification of a set of new drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to train physicians efficiently, assure high-quality patient care, and provide the United States with a robustly competent physician workforce. Current assessment practices require attending physicians and surgeons to review tens-to-hundreds of data points, removing them from clinical activities. Integrating a machine learning model in an existing resident assessment system to predict performance can address trainees’ learning needs and identify excelling, competent, and struggling residents months earlier. This is vital to patient care: earlier identification of trainee performance can benefit patient care faster than the current human-based, semiannual process. Improved tracking and documentation of competence may be of interest to multiple stakeholders including patients, hospitals, third-party payers such as insurance companies or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the residency accreditation entity, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Improved, automated assessment models using existing trainee data help training programs facing increasing documentation burden, as well as hospitals and third-party payers interested in reducing adverse health events for the patients they serve.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate an artificial intelligence model to support resident physician training programs in customizing training based on individual learners’ needs. Starting with plastic and reconstructive surgery and one of the four training programs in the United States engaged in time-variable training is an efficient way to create, test, and assess the model’s efficacy. The created machine learning model will be assessed for its predictive ability at different points during resident physicians’ training and compared with attending physicians’ assessments of trainees’ skills. Such models make time-variable training feasible enabling adaptive, needs-based scheduling of various educational rotations. This has the added advantages of keeping residents fully engaged in their training and returning faculty physicians to clinical care faster, improving job satisfaction and reducing risk of burnout. Ultimately, time-variable training and use of their associated machine learning models will reduce the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; accelerate the entry of new, fully competent physicians into the workforce; and retain valuable physician educators in the workforce.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is two-folds: (1) increasing the accessibility of construction lightweight aggregate (LWA) for the concrete industry and (2) conversion of waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA) to value-added products (i.e., construction LWA). Yearly, about 100 million tons of coal combustion ash is produced in the US, of which only about 60% is recycled and the rest is moved to the landfills. This imposes risks to human health and the environment. Meanwhile, accessibility of construction LWA that is traditionally produced from clay, slate, and shale is challenging for the concrete industry in some states due to the absence of local construction LWA manufacturers. Therefore, LWA must be imported from elsewhere in the country, increasing (i) the final cost for the material and (ii) greenhouse gas emission due to transportation. With an abundance of W-CCA landfills scattered throughout the US, LWA can be produced from this material near the landfill sites to increase the local accessibility of construction LWA for the concrete industry. By implementing this technology, the environmental impact of W-CCA will be reduced, natural resource consumption will be prevented, CO2 emission associated with material transportation will be reduced, and users can save money by having access to local construction LWA.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses hurdles associated with manufacturing a novel porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) produced from waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA). The melting properties of W-CCA enable the production of construction LWA with superior engineering properties, including increased water absorption/desorption capacity and concrete workability relative to traditional LWA.  The deliverables of this project include: (i) development of a LWA with desired sintering properties during pilot-scale production to assure technical feasibility of scaling-up the proposed technology, (ii) optimization of pilot-scale rotary kiln parameters translatable to large-scale production, (iii) demonstration of the superior engineering properties of LWA for concrete applications produced at lab pilot-scale, and (iv) demonstration of the non-leachability of W-CCA based LWA in encapsulated concrete applications.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will be to recycle certain plastics into soil amendments to improve both environmental degradation and agricultural health.  Plastic waste is a persistent environmental pollutant partly due to the lack of comprehensive technologies to reduce the in-circulation inventory of these petrochemical products, and comparably low value of plastic-derived and recycled products. The carbon contained within mixed plastic waste represents both a significant pollutant, but also a potentially valuable alternative feedstock for domestic agriculture and regenerating degraded soils. Soil carbon is a key driver in building soil health, agricultural productivity and food security, as well as a significant reservoir for long-term carbon sequestration. This project remediates traditionally non-recyclable, low-value mixed plastic waste and transforms it into a high value compost-like material. The proposed research develops a low-cost, distributed, decentralized process suitable for small, remote, rural, marginalized and underrepresented communities to achieve sustainable, domestic solid waste management as well as build and regenerate soil health for self-sufficient local agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase I project will scale and optimize a plastic oxidation process that employs a novel high efficiency intramolecular modification of Fenton oxidation. The aqueous process utilizes a low-cost, green catalyst that does not require high temperatures or organic solvents to cleave and oxidize a wide range of commercial polymers into bioavailable long-chain fatty acids suitable as a soil microbe substrate and soil organic carbon amendment. Compared to the highly variable process of natural biodegradation, this reaction ensures complete remediation before environmental application through controlled chemical oxidation. This research will aim to characterize this novel process towards a scalable technoeconomic model to guide translation at scale. Methods include near-infrared spectroscopy to track the elimination of microplastics and other toxic components common to plastic waste processing. The plastic-derived, environmentally beneficial soil amendments will be further studied in greenhouse and field trials to evaluate key agronomic indicators, such as amendment-microbe interactions, soil health, productivity and others.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing safe, cost-effective elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater in order to protect human health and the environment while reducing the cost and complexity of remediation. PFAS are some of the world’s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS pose a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. PFAS in groundwater cannot be broken down through traditional chemical processes; Hence, current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream where the efficacy and safety of disposal are still uncertain.  This project focuses on the development of a low cost, sustainable treatment method that eliminates PFAS with no secondary waste generation and no costly consumables.  This technology removes the liability and environmental and health risks associated with incomplete elimination and secondary waste disposal.

    The objective of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to develop a safe, chemical-free and low cost PFAS electrolyzer for groundwater remediation. The electrolyzer consists of a divided radial-field unit cell architecture with a de-polarized cathode and a high surface area and low-cost anode electrocatalyst material. The electrocatalyst is designed to provide direct oxidation at high voltage and the treatment process will mineralize PFAS in a single step, in minutes, with no breakdown byproducts or secondary waste. A scalable, single unit cell bench-top electrolyzer will be designed and built for treatability testing of PFAS-contaminated groundwater.  The anode electrocatalyst material composition will be optimized and coated onto high surface area substrates.  A de-polarized cathode will be developed to eliminate the catholyte loop and hydrogen generation, and lower energy consumption. The PFAS mineralization effectiveness will be measured as a function of operating parameters and water quality.  The electrocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism of the new anode material will be determined. Using the experimental results, the capital and operating cost of a groundwater remediation system will be estimated.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the development of an economically viable process that can help mitigate and reverse climate change by pulling carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and using it to make durable polymers used in items that surround us every day. There is increasing global pressure to end emissions-intensive, fossil fuel-based operations. However, society has a extensive infrastructure that uses hydrocarbon as fuels as well as in plastics and other polymers. The proposed system will be used to manufacture useful hydrocarbon materials using carbon dioxide captured from air and hydrogen split from water. This technology represents a new pathway for meeting global demand for hydrocarbons without relying on fossil fuels, which may result not only in reduced emissions but in a net draw-down of the “legacy CO2” in the atmosphere. This technology may create new jobs in the American economy, mostly outside the urban commercial centers.

    This SBIR project will develop a novel system that integrates CO2 direct air capture into a water electrolysis device so as to produce a stream of captured CO2 and green hydrogen (H2) from a single device with energy requirements not much higher than water electrolysis alone. The system relies on two primary innovations: 1) a water electrolysis process using a unique buffer solution and a novel reactor design that combines direct air contact with water electrolysis to simultaneously capture CO2 and produce H2 from water, and 2) a new hollow fiber membrane bioreactor that uses multiple layers of hydrogel-encapsulated organisms to convert the electrolysis reactor’s emissions into biogenic methane (also known as renewable natural gas or RNG), and eventually into more complex hydrocarbon molecules. The goal of this project is to optimize the performance of both the electrolysis reactor and the bioreactor in order to demonstrate an economically viable pathway for capturing ambient CO2 and “upcycling” it into RNG. While the initial upcycling target is RNG, the emissions from the electrolysis reactor are suitable for conversion into more complex hydrocarbons.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve data harnessing and real-time intelligent decision making. The proposed technology is a new reconfigurable computing platform capable of performing a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks in a distributed and parallel manner to deliver the best performance at a lower cost. The end products are AI accelerator chips that can be integrated in Accelerator Cards or as co-processors to be applied in both server and edge computing solutions to accelerate AI tasks. The general market need is particularly acute for data center and cloud computing industries where major pain points are performance bottlenecks and high costs due to custom chips or reliance on graphic processing units. The core value propositions of the proposed technology are faster compute, programmability at run-time, and easier integration with existing software to enable execution of popular machine learning frameworks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase I project centers around a novel computing approach where computing and memory elements are parallel and distributed, and interconnection between computing elements is flexible. The project develops an integrated circuit chip that can be reconfigured at run-time to behave as a custom application-specific integrated circuit for each running Artificial Intelligence (AI) application to deliver the optimal performance. It will overcome the memory bottleneck that traditional computing technologies face where data needs to be continuously loaded to and from memory.  The proposed technology also addresses the adaptivity challenge for evolving AI models and datasets. The proposed activities include a chip fabrication using a 28nm commercial semiconductor foundry process, extensive benchmarking of the new technology for scalability, adaptability to data size and shape, and research on a software interface to execute codes developed by existing machine learning frameworks in the new chip. The prototype chip is expected to demonstrate distributed and parallel computing capabilities along with dynamic reconfigurability.  The benchmarking work is anticipated to reveal at least an order of magnitude improvement over more conventional graphics processing unit based approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to secure Integrated Circuit (IC) Intellectual Property (IP) against untrusted parties in the globalized IC supply chain.  Outsourcing of IC foundries creates risks of IC reverse engineering, overproduction, theft, and even piracy. A promising method of achieving hardware IP security is by logically locking the functionality of a design by replacing a subset of the design components with programmable elements. The correct content of these elements forms the key for unlocking/activation of the design in a secure facility and/or via a secure protocol after manufacturing. A technical challenge in commercializing this technology is the long time period typically needed to assess the security of a locked design against state-of-the-art attack algorithms at the design phase. This project will address this technical challenge by developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted design security analyzer tool to instantaneously provide an accurate attack runtime estimation on a locked design, significantly reducing the design time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly shorten the time required to assess attack resiliency of an obfuscated (locked) Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Running the state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability solvers (SAT attack) on a state-of-the-art computer server to de-obfuscate a locked design can take time - ranging from days to months. Such a long security analysis time is prohibitive for deployment in the design process where iterative design optimizations are needed for making power, performance, area, and security (PPAS) trade-offs. This project aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel approach that will bring the security assessment time down to near zero using a machine-learning based model. Based on recent advancements in graph and geometric deep learning techniques, an innovative end-to-end security assessment framework is proposed that directly and losslessly ingests the original design as a graph-structured input, and then automatically learns the discriminative features that influence logic locking security. To support sufficient data for the proposed data-driven method, a logic locking macro-database will be developed that encompasses the required PPAS, attack and defense information.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide cruelty-free, safe and sustainable solutions to replace animal-sourced exotic leathers by leveraging new advances in biotechnology and additive manufacturing. The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of employing natural as well as synthetic components for the fabrication of exotic skins as a precursor raw material for further processing into consumer goods. Specifically, formulations composed of chemical building blocks of native animal skin will be designed, formulated, produced, and subsequently fabricated into composite leather mimics using advanced additive manufacturing platforms. If successful, the proposed efforts will lead to prototypes of engineered composite materials that reproduce the aesthetic, physical, mechanical, and performance properties of exotic leathers. Providing animal-free, sustainable, and environmentally friendly options to conventional exotic leathers can have a significant societal and environmental impact, while opening a new market and supporting growth in the leather processing and tanning industry.

    This project will replace conventional exotic leathers with alternatives that mimic the native structure and biochemical composition of exotic skins; recapitulate the mechanical and physical properties of the exotic leathers; and able to be manufactured using environmentally friendly, sustainable and xenofree technologies. Two critical technical challenges addressed as part of the proposed research will include engineering the architecture of exotic leathers in a bottoms-up approach by combining the relevant building blocks of exotic skins; and employing advanced manufacturing platforms to develop processes that are xenofree, sustainable and environmentally friendly. The research goal is to replicate the constituent collagen-based building blocks of the dermal matrix. Collagen fibrils of the dermal matrix are formed primarily by the triple-helix-forming polypeptide subdomains that can independently recreate the fibrillar self-assembled geometries seen with full-length collagen protein. The proposed work will use collagen and collagen-mimicking subdomains, along with other matrix molecules, to mimic the molecular and supramolecular self-assembly of fibrils in the dermal matrix to precisely control the diameter, density, and orientations of the constituent structures of leather.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to build a condition assessment and monitoring platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for intelligent decision support to expedite diagnosis and facilitate personalized therapy solutions. Currently, patient history data is obtained verbally, and poor health communication between clinician and patient potentially causes 78% of misdiagnoses, resulting in 80,000 avoidable hospital deaths and $750 billion in costs to the US economy each year. Language barriers exacerbate this situation significantly, increasing the risk of severe and frequent adverse outcomes by 49%. Patients with cultural, language, and low health literacy are twice as affected. The proposed work has three major technical objectives: (1) develop an interactive visually-supported healthcare data capture user interface (UI) to overcome communication and language barriers, (2) develop an AI-based risk assessment engine to communicate symptoms to the provider for triage decisions, and (3) leverage predictive analytics to recommend appropriate treatment options and develop a visualization-based condition monitoring and management tool.  The proposed data collection and AI-powered provider decision support platform will empower patients and providers by enhancing communication, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is designed for accessibility across all levels of literacy and is language-agnostic. The platform’s digitally-native, cloud-based approach allows it to be scalable for widespread impact and faster impact. The frontend app captures important patient information and symptoms before the patient exam and summarizes the patient self-report in an easily readable format for the clinician. The clinician will potentially be more prepared, facilitating the delivery of personalized care and improved outcomes by avoiding misdiagnosis, errors, and complications earlier in a patient’s journey. The AI-based model pulls structured data, such as demographic information and symptoms from the patient self-report, and the dataset undergoes supervised learning using historical, real-world outcomes data. Multiple AI models will be evaluated, including classification and neural network models, and those with sufficiently accurate performance will be considered as inputs for ensemble learning, the final prediction output for this project. Example outputs include patient evaluators such as consistencies within the patient’s self-report, an estimated risk assessment score, and an approximate diagnosis accuracy score.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to leverage architecture as a new tool for advancing health and wellbeing. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital architecture systemically affects patient health, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. However, architects often lack the tools to reliably predict how design choices will impact building operations.   Often hospitals and clinics designs fall short with building owners not able to achieve organizational metrics and goals, and patients can see poorer quality of care, increased medical errors, and even higher mortality rates.  The commercial impact will stem from a software platform that equips architects with no-code workflows necessary to deploy data-driven design while managing project timelines and internal costs. Although the Phase I project focuses on healthcare architecture, the broader impact will be that architects will be able to design all buildings to optimize health, productivity, and organizational goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of 1) algorithms that generate structured architectural data capturing spatial qualities that affect occupant health, 2) data visualization interfaces for exploring and validating spatial data and health data jointly, and 3) statistical and machine learning models for identifying meaningful relationships between architectural characteristics and health outcomes across large-scale datasets. These tools will be tested and evaluated by conducting a proof of concept study with a large health system. The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of untested statistical machine learning methods to identify meaningful relationships between architecture and health outcomes. The proposed research will provide new types of insight into architecture's role in affecting health outcomes, providing a novel approach to data-driven design. Though the focus of this proposal is on architectural data, the principles explored will push boundaries of current limits by 1) incorporating qualitative and quantitative data in machine learning models, 2) assessing new modes of interpretability via data visualization, and 3) advancing methods for working with sparse but rich datasets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce opioid dependence.  A critical challenge in the use of opioids on a long-term basis is balancing benefit and risk, based on determining the optimal dosage to manage the associated risks against side effects.  Opioid tapers are used to manage this risk and may last from several weeks to several years. However, following the voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, many patients report improvements in function, sleep, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or even with decreased pain levels. Furthermore, tapers are typically used to manage opioid tolerance, hyperalgesia, enable more effective pain management prior to surgical procedures, or transition to another form of opioids or non-opioid pain medication.  Nearly 18 million Americans may benefit from an opioid taper to improve the long-term management of their chronic pain and improve the safety and effectiveness of chronic opioid therapy.  In particular, in rural communities, patients may not have access to pain specialists and rely on their primary care physicians for chronic pain management. The proposed technology provides a critical tool for opioid tapering to rural primary care physicians, where almost half of the opioids are prescribed. Using the clinical decision support tool, primary care physicians will have a virtual pain specialist advising of the anticipated predictive outcomes and actions to ensure a successful taper with direct feedback from the patient.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply machine learning techniques to develop algorithms using a dataset that describes successful and unsuccessful tapers with clinical data, medical decision making, patient experience, and physician /patient interaction and communication. The predictive model will inform the medical decision-maker of the likelihood of successive patient events and their impact on the taper outcome based on real-time data about the patient's physical, psychological, social, and emotional experience.  This innovation will be implemented on a smartphone platform to extend the physician / patient medical decision model beyond the clinical setting into the patient's environment. This will create a new model of a patient-centric taper wherein the estimated clinical outcomes and associated actions are informed by optimizing the patient experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance exploration and commercial development of the Moon and, eventually, solar system, by lowering the risk of damage to surface and orbital infrastructure from ejected lunar dust during rocket landings and launches. This activity is in the area of material processing/manufacturing in space, and focuses on the space infrastructure (civil works) market sector, similar to roads and airports on Earth. Creating a viable, cost-effective solution to mitigate lunar dust will lower the cost of accessing the lunar surface and accelerate the development of lunar surface infrastructure that is necessary for all aspects of sustainable commercial space development, including mining, manufacturing, construction, habitation, power generation, communications, and in particular, transportation. Facilitating lunar exploration will expand scientific knowledge of the solar system.  It will also enhance commercial development that will expand economic opportunities by opening new areas of the economy in space, with inevitable spin-off benefits for life on Earth. In the long term, the capacity to create new areas for habitation on the Moon and throughout the solar system will have profound impacts on human society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes building lunar landing pads to address the problem of surface dust ejected during rocket landings and launches, which can otherwise damage both nearby and distant infrastructure, including those structures located the other side of the Moon and in orbit. To minimize transport costs from Earth, surface infrastructure must be constructed from local materials as much as possible. Instead of using high-energy processes to harden regolith, this approach will bind it with a high-performance polymer created from lunar volatiles co-located with water-ice in polar regions. This solution reduces mass, cost, and technical risk by leveraging anticipated water-ice mining operations and utilizing discarded volatiles from their operations to produce high-quality polymers.  The approach may be sustainable, producing enough material annually to replace worn-out sections of landing pads. Phase I will focus on converting raw volatiles into polymer precursors, fabricating/testing candidate composite materials, and elaborating the concept of operations, through a combination of research, modeling, and laboratory experiments. Information gathered during Phase I will narrow the range of candidate polymers for further consideration, identifying chemical synthesis pathways for more extensive development, and highlighting areas of improvement to maximize commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the cognitive runtime capabilities of edge native Internet of Things (IoT) platform that offers significant gain in incremental operational intelligence, real-time monitoring, and autonomic functions. As the edge computing capabilities infiltrate into industrial IoT application domains to overcome the limitation of centralized computing (latency, bandwidth, and single point of failure), constrained hardware (compute and storage) resources, and data availability. The proposed technology may adjust with the changing cyber-physical environment, extend situational awareness, protect against cyber security threats, minimize the cost of scaling network and cloud infrastructures, and deliver extreme responsiveness within mission critical ecosystems such as smart grid surveillance, remote patient monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and defense weaponry systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research a cognitive internet-of-things (IoT) runtime that enhances process automation and analytical capabilities of edge native M2M/IoT solutions. The recent trends of edge computing have created service opportunities catering to real-time use cases closer to the operating environment. The most common predefined rule-based logic and structured intelligence on edge nodes fails to deliver scalability, autonomy, interoperability, and intelligent control operations. The artificial intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) models usually perform better on cloud or multiclause server infrastructure in a batch mode. This invention closes the existing gap and further advances the distributed edge computing capabilities by introducing Cognitive AI models that introduce semantic learning with incremental data from within embedded runtime and develop reasoning through interactions within the connected environment. The research and development on Per-to-Peer collaboration across the edge nodes overcomes the limitations of constrained resource and executes workflows. The runtime architecture simulates the human nervous system’s anatomical layers and systematic coordination of neuro-motor operations.  The proposed design patterns of analytical models and distributed intelligence will introduce a realistic implementation of smarter decision support systems on the edge that could adapt to ever changing operational contexts and introduce diverse intelligent operations through collaborative learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project stems from developing a wireless communications technology based on physical (PHY) layer rateless codes.  If successfully demonstrated, these codes could provide high data rates with low computational costs, minimum latency, and enhanced energy efficiency, i.e., long battery life. The initial target of the technological innovation is the space communications market - both commercial and government space programs. Space communication systems are a critical and integral part of every space mission. This Phase I project focuses on an enabling technology addressing capability gaps that could provide cheaper and faster solutions for the data communication systems. Commercialization of the proposed technology is beneficial to the US economy and government since the development of innovative technologies for the space sector contributes to economic growth in the emerging space economy. The proposed next-generation wireless communications technology may also support a wide variety of applications and use cases in the terrestrial wireless market. These application areas include 5G Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a PHY rateless codes-based novel adaptive transmission technology for the reliable transmission of information bits between a wireless transmitter and receiver. PHY rateless codes have the innate ability to adapt both the code construction and the number of code bits for an as-needed transmission of code bits. The adaptive transmission technology in the PHY layer interacts with the automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols in the data link layer (DLL) affecting its sequence of operations. The DLL designed for the traditional fixed-rate coding is a poor match for the PHY rateless system. A key goal of the proposed Phase I project is to design a simple and yet effective DLL for a proximity space link using PHY rateless codes which optimizes the throughput, establishing the technical feasibility. The Phase I project aims to add new design features to the PHY rateless encoder and decoder based on deep learning/auto encoder enhancements, structured permutations, and efficient algorithms/techniques for solving sparse linear systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on the development of a more secure computer infrastructure in the US, particularly for building automation systems, power systems, etc. Much of the current infrastructure runs on older computer architectures and the hardware suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed by upgrading the software.  This project seeks to allow ventors to find and fix hardware vulnerabilities more quickly and without constraints from intellectual property holders.  The project will allow un-modified Linux binaries to run as unikernels on the reduced instruction set of reduced instruction set computer-V (RISC-V) architecture. The RISC-V architecture is an open ISA (instruction set architecture) and allows for rapid innovation and broad adoption in the expanding edge and IoT (internet of things) space. Being able to deploy applications to RISC-V as unikernels versus ordinary Linux guests brings strong security, performance, and deployment benefits to the ecosystem.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project directly addresses performance, security, and deployment problems current edge and IoT projects. Current edge-based systems use operating systems that are multi-decades old, are hard to upgrade, and are targeted in cyberattacks worldwide. To enable advanced technology that requires edge compute such as machine learning applications to be safely deployed, the security concerns of the underlying operating system must be addressed. Unikernels are single process systems that can run programs on the same virtual machines with a heavily reduced attack surface. By applying unikernel technology to the RISC-V architecture, advanced technology can be more quickly deployed in a safer manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the uptime of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and similar robotic systems to nearly one hundred percent at factories and fulfillment centers to further improve productivity and reduce overhead costs. These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in the marketplace.

    \ Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the degradation, waste and shortage\

    \ overall health and vigor of stored blood, including rare blood types, and extending\
    \ the shelf life of blood and platelets.  Donated blood begins to degrade on day\
    \ 11 and expires on day forty-two.  Platelets expire within 5-7 days of storage.\
    \  By increasing the shelf-life of healthy blood, the proposed technology decreases\
    \ waste and addresses the shortage of blood supplies around the world. The current\
    \ global blood shortage is 30 M units per year, and 18 M units of donated blood\
    \ are wasted due to expiration. Globally, 400 M people with rare blood types don't\
    \ have consistent access due to the cost of frozen rare blood.  Degradation in\
    \ red blood cells due to oxygen exposure and other factors begin as early as days\
    \ 11 - 21 after collection, impacting post-transfusion recovery by increasing\
    \ mortality, serious infections, multi-organ failure, thrombosis, and the length\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address challenges of animal farming through cell-based meat production. Approximately 30% of the Earth’s surface, 70% of all arable land, and 29% of the global freshwater supply is dedicated to animal farming. Livestock is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major threat to biodiversity. 70% of all antibiotics used in the United States are used on farm animals and contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Cell-based meat development is estimated to generate significant reductions in greenhouse gases and use of land, water, and energy, as well as antibiotics in meat production. The proposed project aims to develop novel technologies that will accelerate cell-based meat development.

    The proposed project develops a novel scaffolding material for the generation of animal tissue, specifically skeletal muscle. The proposed project will ultimately advance current scientific knowledge on the mechanisms underlying tissue generation and elucidate the molecular principles governing cell adhesion, differentiation, and growth of animal cells during tissue development. Key technical objectives include demonstrating that the proposed scaffold can be successfully customized to harbor any cell adhesion molecule of interest, and proving that a novel biomaterial can be adapted as a tissue-culture-grade reagent. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to ascertain the extent of animal cell adhesion and growth on the proposed scaffold. These studies will advance understanding of animal cell interactions with their extracellular milieu, and how environmental molecular properties and cues are tuned to influence de novo tissue development in vitro.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is faster and accurate detection of Salmonella species in food processing plants. Salmonella bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of foodborne illness. Food contamination in processing facilities can lead to serious public health problems as well as costly recalls of millions of food units. Rapid and accurate sensing technology is currently lacking for definitive detection of Salmonella in food-processing plants, which delays initiation of appropriate control measures and increases the likelihood of spreading contamination and foodborne illnesses to consumers. This technology will enable more frequent testing throughout the entire manufacturing process at reduced costs. It is fully expected that this technology could be applied to the detection of other pathogens.

    The proposed project will create and test a rapid (20 minutes), hand-held, sensitive (1 bacteria cell per milliliter) platform to enable food-processing facilities to detect Salmonella on site. The innovation of this technology lies in the ability to avoid bacterial enrichment (22 to 48 hours to allow bacteria to grow), while still sensitively and selectively detecting Salmonella species. The device uses a testing cartridge to bring bacteria directly to a detection surface, which consists of graphene printed or scribed on a test-strip and subsequently functionalized with Salmonella-specific antibodies. Unique laser processing induces a 3D-structured surface at the nanoscale level in graphene that becomes highly conductive for biosensing and for antibody attachment, which are desirable properties for enabling low detection limits and increasing test sensitivity. These technologies can be combined into a portable platform to make a user-friendly handheld biosensor and displaying quantitative counts of bacteria. The integrated platform (test strip and cartridge) will be designed to interface with existing portable electrical readers in much the same fashion that diabetics monitor blood glucose levels at home with a blood test strip that connects to a portable reader with a digital display.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate and improve the development and optimization of enzyme products.  This project will develop a platform that reduces costs and delays associated with research.  These enzyme products will improve the cost, safety, and sustainability in a range of applications, such as biomass processing, animal nutrition, solid and liquid waste management, household and industrial cleaners, and enzyme replacement therapies.  This solution will support the growth of the $10 billion enzyme market.

    The proposed project will advance a fluorescence-based enzyme activity-sensing platform, by reducing barriers to development of new industrial biocatalysts, enabling the rapid design of hydrolytic enzymes for industrial and specialty markets through the development of modular enzyme activity probes. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research and development are (1) determining performance metrics (limits of detection, speed, accuracy) relative to existing characterization techniques, (2) determining effects of sensor preparation methods on sensor performance, and (3) developing a robust reader for field use. The goals of the proposed research and development are to (1) provide parity data to current assays for end-users to engender confidence in our approach, (2) standardize production protocol, and (3) provide hand-held reader that is inexpensive (<$3000) and can withstand rough handling in field. At a high level, these goals will be achieved by (1) testing our sensors on a panel of candidate enzymes that have rigorous characterization already (to establish performance metrics), (2) using designed experiments to screen process space of sensor preparation and model effect on sensor performance attributes, and (3) using a design-build-test engineering framework to test reader components and layout.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines, scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.  This project advances a peptide production system.

    The proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure, novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and purification.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved sustainable food production. Mycotoxins are common contaminants found in cereal grains that can track through feed production and ultimately poison livestock animals. These poisoning events manifest as waste and inefficiency within human food supply chains. Animals consuming contaminated feed grow more slowly, produce less milk/eggs, are more susceptible to disease, etc. This equates to lost profits for the famers, lost meals for the consumer, and concerns over long-term food security. This SBIR Phase I project addresses this challenge through detection of these toxins. This technique offers a potentially transformative new tool in the field of point-of-source diagnostics, while simultaneously addressing the needs of the industry. This toxin detection system will be faster, simpler, and more versatile.

    The proposed project advances a new generation of mycotoxin detection technologies. This technique employs novel compounds designed to associate with a specific mycotoxin of interest to enable reliable quantitative detection. These detector compounds operate by changing the spectroscopic properties of the toxin, such that it can be detected even in complex biological mixtures like animal feed. The project investigates the extraction buffer composition and the detector compound design. The buffer and detector compound combinations will be optimized by characterizing the spectroscopic signatures under different excitation conditions.  This research program will target the two key classes of mycotoxins most relevant to industry.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.

    The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve research in the life sciences. This research often uses confocal and fluorescence imaging technologies to capture high-resolution, high-contrast images of biological samples. However, these methods traditionally require high levels of illuminating light, resulting in damage to tissues, disruption of normal processes like cell division, and competing with the light being measured in the experiment.  The proposed solution will improve the collection of light in these microscopes.  This will allow researchers to minimize damage to samples, thus removing current experimental constraints and enabling the development of new and far-ranging applications on an already powerful research platform. The proposed technology will be useful for disease and pharmaceutical research.

    The proposed project will involve the development of a simple, add-on, mirrored sample chamber unit capable of enhancing confocal microscopy capabilities by substantially increasing microscope fluorescence collection efficiency limits. This will require overcoming design challenges because the use of mirrors to collect and refocus emitted light has rarely been attempted in confocal microscopy. The proposed R&D work includes: 1) sample chamber and mirror design and prototyping, 2) design of mounting hardware and integration with an existing confocal system, and 3) exploration of compatible modalities, including Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy. Completion of the proposed objectives will lead to the development of a device that increases the light collection efficiency beyond the current 40% limit, is compatible with any detection objective, and does not require a separate optical path to the detector.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve drone control. Current controllers are effective in specific environments but perform poorly in environments and flight conditions such as turbulence, thereby narrowing the scope in which drones can be used.  This project will advance a plug-and-play solution in which users can focus on higher-level tasks specific to their use case, like obstacle avoidance and route planning. This new controller has broad applications in both commercial and military settings: it enables stable flight across a wide array of environments, expands the flight envelope in turbulent conditions, and allows for longer missions due to increased control efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of drone control in turbulence through the development of a reinforcement learning-based flight controller. The project will enlarge the design envelope for quadcopters as well as provide a system and environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to other control problems. Contemporary systems rely on Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controllers as an essential part of stable flight. These PID controllers rely on holistically tuned, static functions to convert maneuvering commands into voltage changes across drone motors to meet the rotor’s targeted rotation speed. In lieu of statically defined PID equations, this novel controller uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a subset of machine learning where an agent is trained to select actions that maximize a reward across an environment. This technique has led to greater-than-human performance across a variety of different control and game theory tasks, but little is known about how these techniques fare when replacing PID control systems. The primary advantage the development of a reinforcement learning controller would have over simpler PID controllers is the ability for the user to view drone control at a higher level of abstraction, thus mitigating the need to focus on the minutiae of flight control for complex missions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of modular power sub-systems (power-stacks) that will enable a new generation of power inverters that are compact, re-usable, upgradable, resilient against die-supply shortages, and can be manufactured faster and cheaper. As the world migrates to sources of clean energy and the further electrification of industry, transportation, and homes, there is a significant and growing demand for electric power converters. Widespread adoption of clean energy requires that these converters be simple, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Today's designs are inconvenient both for end customers and for converter suppliers, as they typically are: complex, large, heavy, inflexible, expensive, and slow to market.  Current inverter are often made by only a few specialized companies and  have high technical barriers to entry for inexperienced entrants. Additionally, current inverters are locked to power-die suppliers, making scale-up and  re-use challenging. The proposed project will develop and test a novel approach to enable inverters to meet new market demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel approach to power conversion problems.  High speed operation of high-power semiconductor switches typically generates significant heat.  The novelty of the proposed innovation  over current technologies resides in moving the point of electrical isolation from adjacent to the power-die to adjacent to the coolant, and massively integrating the power path, the control path and thermal path into scalable building blocks.  An additional advantage is the ability to develop new manufacturing processes to build and integrate these blocks reliably. The outcomes of this project may be a design and manufacturing approach that results in 50% reduced development time and development cost, 80% lower weight and size, a $100-$200 per unit cost reduction, increased scalability, and improved resilience to die-supply shortages.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new rapidly dry-sanitizing technology for disposable single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) and other articles in a manner that preserves material integrity and function to enable multiuse during pandemic and post-pandemic times. It will promote energy and water conservation, and reduce plastic waste significantly. This ozone-based sanitization technology will benefit all frontline workers regularly exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The need for rapid sterilization technology is likely to grow to mitigate social distancing configurations. Schools, daycare centers, health and fitness facilities, factories, and airports will need to implement sterilization protocols. With this technology, clothes, face shields and masks, phones, smart devices, and all manner of personal articles can be easily sanitized in less than ten minutes. The market for small industrial-scale waterless appliances with the capacity to offer on-demand sterilization may also expand rapidly. While ozone is used in a wide range of sterilization technologies, there is currently no consumer-friendly dry washing machine.  Thus, this project may also support development of an eco-friendly and effective laundry solution. Together, the sanitization and safety tasks will advance this technology as a viable waterless sanitization device, with the distinct advantage of lower cost, compact size, operational ease, and accessibility.

    The proposed project advances translation of a low-cost, rapidly deployable gas-based field sanitizer that does not require water, solvents, or detergents. To combat infectious viruses and odor-causing bacteria, this technology must meet aggressive benchmarks set by federal regulatory agencies for ozone emissions while achieving the highest bioburden reduction levels short of an autoclave. This project will optimize the ozone dose (ppm and time of exposure) required for viral inactivation and testing mask fit and filtration efficiency after repeated exposure to high ozone concentrations. The device will also incorporate new containment and neutralization technologies to meet environmental safety requirements. The device performance will be characterized by monitoring the exhaust for residual ozone during and after operation.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project relates to the unmet need for new and effective therapeutics that target the lung. This proposal outlines a novel treatment for the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19; however, this technology will also find use in other acute pulmonary disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Currently the options for treatment of pulmonary disorders include supplemental oxygen, ventilators, or nitrous oxide (NO) gas, which is toxic and cumbersome to use. Current technology uses gaseous NO which is a toxic gas supplied in high pressure tanks and is present only when inhaling the gas. The proposed project will develop a long-lasting, inhaled NO delivery system to improve lung function of patients suffering from ARDS brought on by COVID-19 or other causes.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances translation of a novel molecule which sequesters NO chemically as a stable solid and can be engineered to degrade at a controlled rate for in situ continuous release. This proposal develops NO donors with optimized performance and stability for pulmonary delivery.  Tasks include: develop and test libraries of NO donor compounds for the ability and rate of NO release; evaluate and select compounds with good solubility characteristics to formulate for aerosolization/ nebulization; test candidates for improvement of lung function in animal models.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is a cost-effective way to manage and track viral outbreaks in animal, human, and plant populations, including tracking for situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.  It overcomes the challenges of current viral screening methods, namely PPE required for collecting samples, handling of samples to centralized analytic sites, cost of tests, and reliance on limited reagents.  The platform proposed in this project could be used on-site at an animal production facility or at home. The scanner can be placed at many municipal and commercial locations (e.g., drug stores) or the envelope can be conveniently mailed for assessment. The dual read modality gives timely feedback to the client, as well as the capability for anonymous aggregation of readout data - essential for real-time tracking of viral outbreak and informing resource allocation to mitigate spread. This diagnostic platform would generate impact, allowing: 1) animal producers to mitigate virus spread and reduce loss and 2) businesses, schools, and other organizations to make real-time data-driven decisions on closures and health policies.

    The proposed project focuses on assessing technical feasibility of three critical elements of a diagnostic platform: (1) the ability to couple isothermal RNA amplification directly to cell-free extract using custom formulations, to simplify usability (eliminate current off-card amplification with commercial kits) and reduce cost; (2) Production of a scalable and efficient cell-free extract well-suited for amplification of reporter proteins by RNA circuits to increase the rate of protein production and reduced RNA degradation.  The performance of this extract will inform the time to result as well as the cost of card, necessary metrics for translation; and (3) production of new toehold riboregulators (2 to 3) selective to virus targets relevant to the animal industry (e.g., swine flu, porcine respiratory).  These will also inform the limits of detection.  This project will evaluate the feasibility of such as system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a technology to support social-emotional health by fostering co-presence, defined as a sense of being together in a virtual environment analogous to person-to-person physical interaction. Loneliness can be debilitating and have detrimental impact on patients aged 65 and over, causing an estimated $7 billion in Medicare costs associated with the effects of morbidity and mortality factors, such as dementia, heart disease, stroke, and depression. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the challenges and opportunities of digital tools in fostering connections associated with mental and physical health. The proposed virtual reality solution and the emerging digital therapeutics sector can address significant challenges faced by hospitals, assisted living care facilities, and mental health facilities, improving clinical outcomes.  The findings of this project are expected to impact other human interaction contexts, such as training, education, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances translation of digital therapeutic tools to foster co-presence.  The project compares physiological and psychological markers between pairs of individuals in both real and virtual contexts in search of significant markers for co-presence. Objectives include development of a custom virtual reality application and collection of quantitative data on pairs of individuals interacting in three social contexts. Proposed research will evaluate the degree to which virtual reality fosters co-presence and focus on specific algorithms and design choices as significant drivers of co-presence.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of a patient-friendly and cost-effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection arising from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The inability to quickly stop the spread of respiratory infectious pathogens can have devastating global consequences, resulting in millions of deaths and creating an enormous economic burden. This project will prove the viability of an aerosolized pan-coronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. An inhalable therapeutic has a stronger commercial potential than the currently approved monoclonal antibodies which require intravenous delivery, and this drug will be more likely to retain potency against future variants. The COVID-19 virus is expected to persist in the human population, and novel variants thereof will continue to emerge. Therefore, this technology could be crucial in addressing these ongoing medical needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of an inhalable decoy receptor that would effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its endogenous cellular target and thus prevent infection of the host. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. The decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface. Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the state-of-the-art for detecting, prioritizing, and responding to misinformation online. As more platforms are moving to end-to-end encryption, it is critical that new tools and algorithms are developed to respond to misinformation on these platforms. Encryption on platforms such as WhatsApp, Viber, LINE, Telegram, and Signal protects the communications of millions of Americans but also potentially allows rumors, misinformation, disinformation, and other threats to spread. This project builds ‘misinformation tiplines’: online accounts that allow users to check potential misinformation with leading fact-checking organizations. The proposed algorithms will allow Americans to check potential misinformation with fact-checking organizations allowing them to identify dangerous—and for health misinformation sometimes life-threatening—misinformation online. The project empowers users of online communication platforms and improves their safety while maintaining the benefits of end-to-end encryption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will overcome key challenges in order to allow tiplines to scale efficiently to millions of users. Tiplines require a thoughtful combination of artificial intelligence and human knowledge. The same misleading claims are often repeated and restated in many different ways online. In order for tiplines to scale, it is necessary to identify the claims being made in messages submitted to tiplines and match them against the extensive library of existing fact-checks. Claims can be in the form of text, image, video, or audio messages and expressed in many different human languages. In this project the company is building the algorithms needed to match these claims across languages and across formats. The results break new ground in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to detect social-emotional issues in children (ages 5-12) for early intervention. A growing trend in juvenile mental health concerns was exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruption in child development. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) system that learns from interactions with the child and parent independently and can detect potential social-emotional concerns.  The ML system enables personalized evaluation and monitoring outside a clinical setting in a remote or hybrid context.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances algorithms for integration into a social-emotional skill building curriculum.  The project proposes: 1) User segmentation based on a comprehensive assessment of social-emotional functioning, 2) Correlation of the relevancy and effectiveness of modules to segmented users, and 3) Collection of information to identify social emotional deficits (red flags). These activities enable a feedback loop to learn and deliver recommendations for each child-parent dyad, personalizing learning in real-time. These algorithms learn from behavioral, social, and emotional inputs from both the parent and child when they engage with the technology. The system will also detect red flags correlated with social and emotional deficits, promoting early intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    \ drilling project from weeks to days reduces the carbon emission from the energy-intensive\
    \ drilling equipment required. This solution to problems associated with acquiring\
    \ subsurface data with traditional techniques has an addressable market segment\
    \ value of $21 billion. The new instrument to be developed will eliminate the\
    \ need for off-site lab services, core drilling, and site geologists, resulting\

    \ for needed US strategic minerals. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project\
    \ is based in the development of a novel drilling module that will be able to\
    \ acquire subsurface chemistry and geotechnical properties of rocks and soils,\
    \ to assess the type and value of minerals present both quickly and accurately.\
    \ The conventional way of evaluating these materials is by core drilling, which\
    \ presents various problems related to cost, sample quality and logistics. This\
    \ research uses a combination of optical images, x-ray fluorescence, and gamma-ray\
    \ density, as well as compressive strength data from a newly curated database\
    \ that will be developed from open-source geospatial data, collections of geology\
    \ and geotechnical reports, rock core databases, implicit geology modeling principles,\
    \ and machine learning methods to characterize rock and soil samples. It aims\
    \ to solve the technical challenges that currently prevent such a tool from being\
    \ available to the industry today; these include mud smearing in the drill hole\
    \ sidewalls, the high pressure and heat of the target environment, and challenges\
    \ in wireless data transmission. The goal of this research is to create, validate\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to improve public health.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment (PPE), including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), have been critical to containing disease spread and protecting first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. Shortages of FFRs have led public health agencies to provide guidance in favor of FFR decontamination and re-use as a crisis capacity strategy. This project seeks to develop a cost-effective approach to support sterilization and re-use of personal protective equipment at the point-of-care. The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the high cost and poor safety of Lithium-ion batteries in new energy applications. Low-cost and safe batteries will improve economic viability for solar energy storage, which is critical to increasing renewables penetration to above 30% of total power generation. This project advances a battery material to provide lower cost, higher safety and improved cyclability compared to currently used materials. This can support new batteries in applications including electric vehicles, grid-tied and solar storage, and consumer power tools, among others.

    This SBIR project proposes a novel nanostructured LiMn2O4 cathode chemistry (ND-LMO) that offers ~30% lower $/kWh cost compared to incumbent nickel managanese cobalt oxides (NMC) materials. Furthermore, it will have iimproved performance parameters, such as cycle life, a safer heat generation profile, and a 10% greater amp-hour capacity between full state of charge and maximum depth of discharge. Many of these improvements stem from the “intercalation-pseudocapacitive” properties of finely nanostructured electrode materials. Technical challenges, such as inactive and deactivating surfaces, synthetic costs, and others, must be addressed for these systems to be commercially viable.  The project’s proposed composition and methods used can be applied to other material systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an easy-to-use virtual reality (VR) toolkit to enable rapid development and deployment of educational VR experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the “backward design” approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve shellfish production at scale and in an environmentally sustainable fashion, using oyster farming as a launching pad.  Today, most oysters are farmed nearshore under ecological stress.  This project advances the culturing of microalgae using internal waste streams and those from other food industries. The focus of this project is to process one of the most abundant, sustainable, and freely available industrial food wastes, spent yeast from breweries, to facilitate algae production at scale onshore and indoors. Although currently used primarily by the food and chemical industries, the less costly algal product could also energize areas of food and feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, biomaterials, and bioremediation services.

    The proposed project will advance the use of off-the-shelf bioreactors and a novel substrate which, along with CO2, form plant tissue heterotrophically in the dark as leaves do photosynthetically in the presence of sunlight. The proposed substrate enables production at scale of the single-celled microalgae that comprise much of the nearshore bivalve diet.  The yeast is fermented with both agriculture-grade vitamins and plant-based commodities.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve agricultural operations with respect to infection.  Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.

    The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal’s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal’s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable plastic recycling process. In the United States less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the remainder are incinerated (15%) or placed in landfills (75%). Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.  This project develops a low-temperature system for high quality, high-value plastic products in closed-loop recycling.

    The proposed project will apply synthetic biology and related biotechnologies to identify, engineer, and optimize new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.  These enzymes will enable closed-loop plastic recycling in an economically viable, low temperature, low CO2 emission process.   The first objective is to sample plastic contaminated environments for naturally occurring enzymes that have evolved to depolymerize PE and PET synthetic polymers.  Candidate PE and PET enzymes will be engineered to accelerate their ability to efficiently target and cut complex PE and PET polymers under scalable process conditions.  Millions of enzyme variants will be constructed, tested, and analyzed using synthetic biology, high-throughput screening, and machine learning technologies.  A primary goal of this effort is to demonstrate a 10-fold increase in PE and PET depolymerization rates compared to naturally occurring plastic degradation proteins.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve monitoring and prevention of breast\

    \ cancer, resulting in added cost and unnecessary anxiety among healthy women.\
    \ On the other hand, limiting the recalls to under 10% causes some cancers to\
    \ be missed. This project advances a new infrared imaging (IR) technology unaffected\
    \ by breast density. It is sensitive to only cancerous tumors because it uses\
    \ their higher metabolic signature, and it can provide accurate estimates of the\
    \ tumor size and location within the breast. The proposed IR imaging technology\
    \ will reduce the overall healthcare cost and improve clinical outcomes. \n\n\
    The proposed IR technology will provide an effective adjunct to mammography and\
    \ it will identify cancerous tumors in dense breast tissue as well. It uses contactless\
    \ IR imaging and the spatial and thermal data obtained from multi-view IR images\
    \ of individual breasts. The IR images are obtained in prone position to avoid\
    \ gravitational distortions and provide clear optical access over the entire breast,\
    \ including the region of inframammary folds. The heat transfer from the tumor\
    \ to the breast’s surface is analyzed and modeled as a straightforward physical\
    \ system. The temperature profile on the breast surface is iteratively compared\
    \ with the IR images until a match is obtained indicating whether a cancerous\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable radiotherapies for metastatic cancer, estimated to account for 90% of the 600,000 cancer deaths in the US each year. Of the approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the US, nearly half are candidates for improved outcomes using some form of radiation-based therapy. Metastatic cancer, however, is generally not treated with radiotherapies due to the need for prior knowledge of the metastatic sites. The proposed project treats metastatic cancer by using the cancer cells themselves to help deliver the radiation. This technology may generate reliable efficacy of radiotherapy for the treatment of the most lethal forms of cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to advance radiotherapy that exploits cancer cells themselves as catalysts for therapeutic delivery. After systemic administration or local injection, the monomers are expected to diffuse through tissues and subsequently polymerize, immobilizing radionuclides in the extracellular space of cancer cells.  Non-cancerous cells will be minimally impacted, as soluble monomers will remain subject to diffusion and relatively rapid tissue clearance in the absence of cancer cell-derived catalysts. The chemistry at the core of the approach is an enzyme-triggered polymerization of native-like compounds under physiological conditions.  The final therapeutic compound features the polymerizable compound and covalently-conjugated radionuclide 131-I, a commonly used radiotherapy isotope.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves leveraging an innovative approach to deliver and monitor therapeutics more effectively. Real-time monitoring and tracking of immune and stem cell therapies is in its infancy. However, without the capability to precisely know where therapeutic cells localize, clinicians cannot assess safety, design optimal doses, or make clinical decisions related to therapeutic approaches. As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients. This proposal addresses a critical unmet need in the cell and gene therapy industry for rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic cells specifically to enable tracking in the body. The addressable market for preclinical and clinical cell tracking in clinical trials involving therapeutic cells in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $1.14 billion by 2024.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an innovative approach to intracellular delivery where mechanoporation or cell-squeezing is achieved simply by propelling cells, in the presence of exogeneous cargo, through a proprietary mechanoporation element that resides in a column designed to be processed in a centrifuge (spin column). End users will realize significant advantages over conventional and microfluidic approaches to intracellular delivery including: 1) Convenient spin column format; 2) Short cell processing times; 3) Ease of scale-up and multiplexing; 4) Applicability to numerous cell types; and 5) Compatibility with automated/robotic cell production systems including autologous cell production systems designed for clinical settings. Three objectives are proposed involving the generation of prototype spin columns and their use in optimizing aspects of element design to afford efficient intermolecular delivery of iron-based nanoparticles (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent) into T-cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells. The study will enable rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic and regenerative cells for in vivo tracking, empowering clinicians to make timely decisions with respect to treatment strategies, thus ensuring better clinical outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to revolutionize wildlife field work and research. Many wildlife professionals already understand the potential for using video as a sensor, but without commercial software to turn video into data, its vast benefits remain untapped. It is important to monitor environmental effects and the impact of urban growth; billions of dollars are spent annually understanding how construction and infrastructure projects are impacting species and habitats. The state of practice is to send technicians into the field for observation. In many situations using a camera system to monitoring for wildlife is not only safer and more effective, but also much less expensive that using human labor. This project will reduce the cost, decrease the timeline, and yield better outcomes for these important conservation efforts, allowing the existing biodiversity to be preserved.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a web-based software-as-a-service to detect, track, and classify wildlife from video and images captured in the field. There is substantial potential for video to provide better data to help wildlife biologists perform their work, but the main barrier is the complexity. Using video systems to study wildlife requires advanced multidisciplinary knowledge; appropriate camera technology, recording methods, advanced video processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.  There are currently no commercial-off-the-shelf hardware or software packages available for biologists. This project will reduce the complexity of obtaining quantitative data from video by developing commercial-off-the-shelf equipment packages, automated video processing software, and the advisory services needed to make this transformational technology more accessible to biologists in the field.  The video processing needed is the focus of the research; the goal is the create algorithms that automate object detection and classification from the video and allow non-experts to create an accurate machine learning classifier with minimal labeling requirements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel tool to visualize indoor spaces.  Emerging “property technology” (PropTech) plays an increasing role in the development of new large commercial buildings; it is anticipated that such PropTech will save billions of dollars per year and stimulate remodeling projects that might not otherwise even be undertaken, once it is made more broadly accessible, and may thus be adopted for the remodeling of small businesses, restaurants, and residences. This project develops a simple, rapid, and affordable generation of accurate floor plans of existing structures, leveraging commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) camera technology (implemented in modern tablets and smartphones) coupled with advanced AI software and algorithms that model and identify common features (walls, doors, windows, furniture) in the 3D images generated by such devices.  The floor plans so generated will provide an accurate, easily generated framework upon which substantial renovations can then be more easily designed.  This is anticipated largely replace the labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes of floor plan generation, thereby reducing operating costs and stimulating new remodeling projects in various markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an AI-driven app that quickly and autonomously reconstructs digital spatial layouts of indoor spaces based on walk through calibrated image capture with modern smartphones or tablets, leveraging time-of-flight or structured-light imaging systems together with embedded motion sensors and advanced data analysis. The key intellectual merit of this project is the deep neural networks and optimization algorithms, together with advanced user-interface/user-experience (UI/UX) to provide an intuitive human interface to this data analysis engine.  This enables adjustment of the reconstruction rules and visualization of the generated model. The technical hurdles include accurate 3D scene reconstruction and 2D floor plan generation based on sensor-generated point clouds and feature recognition in cluttered environments, and the synthesis of multi-room maps from several single-room models.  Rules can be specified by the user as appropriate (defining room adjacency, wall thickness, orthogonality assumptions, etc.).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce financial fraud by closing the gap between current secure computation technologies and the technical requirements of modern anti-money laundering. Banks and financial institutions have a strong interest in creating a secure data exchange mechanism. In 2020 alone, the global fraud and anti-money laundering compliance costs exceeded $181 Billion. Audit and transaction monitoring accounted for 19% of this total expenditure. A single-digit percentage improvement in these two categories represents a market opportunity worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A major benefit of the proposed platform is that the complex financial dynamics of organized crime can be targeted and reduced. In addition to anti-money laundering and fraud detection, the secure computation framework generated by this proposal, i.e., a scalable and fast secure data exchange platform, can be applied to areas such as healthcare, the insurance industry, and national security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to create a systematic solution to overcome the current limitations in fighting fraudulent bank transactions. The main roadblock for effective detection of fraud and money laundering is the lack of a comprehensive view of client data. Currently, each bank has limited information about the client's financial activity and cannot benefit from a holistic view of the client’s profile in other banks. Naive solutions, such as creating a central data exchange entity, have been rendered impractical due to critical data security and privacy concerns. In this project, the team proposes a new methodology to address this challenge by leveraging advanced Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC). Unlike anonymization approaches that hide a specific part of customers’ data, secure computation protocols guarantee data confidentiality even during a joint computation. In the past, SMPC has been impractical due to enormous computational and communication costs. However, the company has made both theoretical and practical breakthroughs that make SMPC more feasible for effective detection of fraud and money laundering. Further research and development is needed to make the solution truly applicable to real-world anti-money laundering scenarios, and thereby produce a technology that can drastically improve fraud detection.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several industries, the company’s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase.  The project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent flows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The software  will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows. The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions. The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy simulations of the vortical wake.

The outcome of this project will be a system that enables holistic, accurate, and faster monitoring of elderly people that will 1) improve quality of life and health of senior citizens, 2) address the future nursing shortage, particularly in the geriatric field, and 3) reduce healthcare costs. The proposed technology can impact a wide range of public health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health monitoring.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project applies real-time computer vision and sensor fusion processing for real-time continuous monitoring and analysis of health-related activities. In addition, this project takes an essential step beyond current solutions by analyzing seniors' group behavior and interactions with objects to determine whether they suffer from loneliness, behavioral disorders, or confusion states. This project utilizes multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize the discriminative power to understand human micro-body motions and thereby create a training framework for personalized behavioral understanding and monitoring. It also proposes an innovative solution to leverage the results of computer vision as attention feedback to thermal sensors to enhance the accuracy and robustness of thermal processing against temperature variations. Furthermore, the project offers an integrative edge-based Internet of Things solution to protect citizens' privacy while providing real-time continuous feedback to responsible personnel. The proposed system offers a novel user experience while protecting personally identifiable information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases, often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  An unbiased screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further enhanced binding to FcRn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to save water and energy across a wide spectrum of industrial and commercial applications (i.e. boilers, baking ovens, furnaces, proofers, HVAC systems) that emit wet exhaust into the environment. For example, the U.S. bread baking market segment alone may save over 50 million therms of energy and over 400 million gallons of water annually with the proposed technology.  The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon’s optimal performance at unconventional conditions. The non-linear phase-change heat transfer mechanisms will be defined and simulated, followed by a sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the channel geometry and thermosiphons array for subsequent prototype design and performance demonstration.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make a new class of antibody-based immunotherapies that can be generally applicable to oncology patients. For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

A study by the Cleveland Clinic determined that 36% of chest tubes were completely obstructed at one point, with 86% of these clots existing in the thoracic cavity, undetected by clinicians. The complications that result from occluded chest tubes can include postoperative atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade. The team will design, develop, and commercialize a novel chest tube to solve the high impact clinical need. This  novel chest tube seeks to reduce drainage-related complications following cardiothoracic surgery. The novel system proactively manages fluid flow within the inner lumen of a catheter in order to flush and drain the tube, reducing the incidence of blood clogging.

    The proposed activity seeks to develop a chest tube that proactively provides fluid flow in order to prevent blood clot formation associated with draining fluid and blood during cardiovascular surgery. The product introduces a novel approach called dilutional coagulopathy for addressing clotting issues, where sterile saline or anticoagulants is proactively used to reduce thrombosis in an enclosed drainage spaces, rather than rely on historical methods of chemical or mechanical barriers for reducing or hindering clot formation. The project aims to develop prototypes using biomaterials and fabrication methods suitable for eventual patient use, and undertake the risks of demonstrating proof of concept and reduced clotting in an animal model of post-surgical drainage complications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is develop an innovative medical technology for localized and sustained antibiotic treatment in the case of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The proposed activities may result in commercialization of an implant with novel reservoir technology to be placed at the infected site, and which will locally deliver antibiotics to eradicate the infection. This solution may improve patient care as well as reduce costs associated with treatment of infection. The development of an implantable, antibiotic-eluting orthopedic spacer which enables patients to return to ambulatory conditions while providing sustained, appropriate, anti-infection resistance for a sustained duration could benefit patients and reduce medical costs. The proposed product seeks to reduce infections and reduce the need for surgical revision and significant antibiotic treatments. If successful, this technology will reduce the burden associated with unresolved infections and avoid amputations.

    This team will design, develop, and validate the proof of concept for an orthopedic spacer. The system will be 3-D printed using a novel porous medium capable of controlled antibiotic elution.  The product will be tested using benchtop mechanical testing and in vitro studies of implanted system viability and controlled elution. The objectives include a study of the prototype's ability to meet design criteria for mechanical performance, as well as a demonstration of a superior antibiotic elution profile over an extended-release period. The mechanical testing to be performed include load, stress, and cycle testing within current standards, in conjunction with in vitro laboratory elution testing of the specified antibiotic substance over a sustained duration of time (up to >180 days).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the creation of a "digital twin," a real-world system projected into spatially-computed environment such as virtual and augmented reality. This technology creates the infrastructure necessary for the application of virtual and augmented reality in industrial workplaces, at scale. By making the full-scale roll out of these technologies possible, the technology seeks to impact human health and safety, operational efficiencies, and environmental risk reduction for process operations facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The long term impacts of the technology may also enable automation and optimization, improving their efficiency, security, and safety. Such facilities are critical infrastructure and play a significant role in the national economy. The availability of this product may also enhance market opportunities for other businesses in the scanning, spatial computing, and training markets. The impact may be further broadened by adapting the process for digital twin production to new domains unrelated to the industrial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing knowledge and understanding in both machine learning and spatial computing. This project focuses on a method for digitizing a complex, real-world system, in an efficient manner, sufficient to recreate the captured reality as an interactive digital twin. The primary technical hurdle is the combining of different data sources that describe aspects of a particular real-world system into a single complete description. The initial physical systems being modelled are industrial process operations, but the core methods could apply to other types of systems, including natural systems, such as a rainforest. For industrial process operations, the goal is to encode the entire process operations facilities at the component level, with sub-cm accuracy, at 10% of the current time and cost requirements. To achieve this, this project will combine physical scans with engineering documentation and relational probabilities. Once combined, the model will be used as the basis for a digital twin of the real-world system projected into spatial computed environments, such as virtual and augmented reality. These techniques replace a tedious and impractical static scan and human labor workflow with rapid scans, computer vision, and a combination of procedural and trained algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of
    conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often
    uncomfortable in the early days because they aren’t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student
    personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be development of a novel platform for the design and high-volume fabrication of microfluidic devices for educational and research purposes. Currently used fabrication methods are not conducive to the large-scale production of robust, high quality, open-channel microfluidic devices that are cost-effective for widespread use outside of specialty applications. The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels. The kits will contribute to educational efforts that address the nation’s demand for STEM professionals, projected to grow at twice the rate of all occupations in the next 10 years, while training students in a field expected to reach a $60 billion market value by 2029.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to eliminate the main technical hurdles that prevent the large scale production of open-channel microfluidic devices. Current lithographic, additive and micromilling fabrication technologies require a combination of expertise, equipment and production time that make them ill-suited for the purpose of assembling devices that are inexpensive and robust enough for consumer use, for example, in educational settings. The proposed platform will leverage new and existing high-volume fabrication technologies to manufacture film-based devices with channels and chambers measured in the tens and hundreds of micrometers, featuring strong bonding between layers to allow for high pressure flow, and at a projected cost of <0.15 USD per device. Research objectives include the development of gravity-based and hand powered pump setups appropriate for educational and low resource settings. The advancements in device fabrication processes achieved in this project are expected to have a positive impact beyond the field of education, facilitating the commercialization of microfluidic technologies in fields like analytical chemistry, biomanufacture and point-of-care biosensing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a stronger understanding of how living things absorb carbon in the ocean. It is important to have an accurate measure of the natural carbon uptake by the ocean because this affects ocean and fishery health, as well as future efforts to intentionally sequester carbon in the ocean to mitigate climate change. This goal will be achieved by developing a low-cost sensor that can be widely deployed on ocean robots, which are already being used to measure processes like ocean heat uptake. The sensor will use light to detect sinking debris in the ocean.  This debris is a major way that carbon is naturally sequestered in the ocean. Distributed, robotic platforms in the ocean allow observations to be made in locations and seasons that are not accessible with research ships. Such platforms are generally lower cost than sensors associated with research ships. Development and sale of sensors for robotic platforms are areas of growth because of the increasing reliance on these platforms for scientific observations. This project may also enhance academic and industry partnerships and help to train upcoming scientists and engineers in instrument development.

    There is a significant desire to expand measurements of ocean biological carbon pump processes to better understand climate change, in particular the flux of carbon by particles settling out of the surface ocean. This project will create a sensor that is designed to be carried aboard globally distributed, autonomous profiling floats.  The sensors/floats may help distinguish among the different modes of biological carbon uptake in the ocean. The sensor will be designed from the ground up to meet the challenges of sampling floats, which have stringent power consumption, cost, and data quality-control requirements. The sensor will also have specific optical and housing geometry characteristics tailored for measurement of sinking particle fluxes. The development stages will consist of optical modeling of proposed sensor geometries, modeling of particle collection efficiencies of different housing geometries, laboratory testing of model particles, and dissemination of results to the scientific community.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – often called “forever” chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.

    \ Survival for OHCA in the U.S. is around 8%-10%, and despite considerable effort\

    \ project is a technology that will be retrofitted to existing shipping fleets\
    \ to increase fuel efficiency while decreasing environmentally harmful emissions.\
    \ \n\nThis project seeks to improve thermal efficiency of fuel distillates, ranging\
    \ from diesel to heavy fuel oil, by using water in fuel emulsions.  The technical\
    \ approach involves the development of process to continuously and consistently\
    \ achieve a homogeneous emulsion that can efficiently ignite inside an internal\
    \ combustion engine.  An inline system for immediate consumption will be developed\
    \ to mitigate phase separation and droplet agglomeration. The novel emulsion will\
    \ provide adequate heat content, lubricity, and low corrosivity comparable to\
    \ standard water-free fuel.  The increased thermal efficiency will in part contribute\
    \ to efforts by the maritime industry to achieve their goals of reducing CO2 emissions\
    \ per transport work by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by\
    \ 2050.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy\
    \ of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to remediate the 17 million tons of textile waste that ends up in landfills annually. Working within the existing economic drivers of the clothing industry, this project aims to deploy technology that can profitably transition the USA away from a wasteful zero-sum linear raw materials model into a resilient local and sustainable circular economy. This project will enable local communities, urban and rural alike, to create economic value (raw materials and jobs) out of textile waste, with a drastic reduction in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions compared to business as usual. This project will develop technology that has an impact on the security and sustainability of the US textile raw materials marketplace, by enabling a re-shoring of an industry in a distributed way that can affect every single American through their clothing purchasing options. If successful, the US could lead the world into a new era of a truly sustainable circular economy for fashion.

    This project aims to advance knowledge and develop the core technologies required for widespread adoption and commercialization of cellulosic textile recycling within the American textile manufacturing industry. By leveraging core competencies and innovative models for polymer science and continuous process design, this project will develop a non-destructive extractive process that will locally and domestically convert end-of-life textile waste into high-value cellulosic circular economy feedstocks of equal or greater quality to virgin material at kilogram scale. As part of this project, the focus will be on extracting cellulose from mixed material textile waste that contain other contaminant components that often hinder its recycling. This approach involves innovative mixtures of green chemistry that enable the rapid extraction of cotton, the spinning of novel fibres, and the efficient recovery of the process chemicals. This project will optimise and further develop this core technology and conduct the prototyping and engineering design required for reproducible cellulosic material (cotton) extraction from clothing waste and its demonstration at multi-kg scale.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality and reproducibility of cancer diagnosis and margin screening.Surgery currently represents the best opportunity for curing invasive cancers but is limited by modern pathology methods. Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for skin cancer because it results in the highest cure rates, but it often takes place in stages, extending surgical procedures. The use of ex vivo confocal microscopy (XVM) is potentially faster, less costly, and inherently both 3-D and digitized, with benefits including: 1) enhanced accuracy, precision, and margin control via enriched 3D information content and simplified specimen orientation maintenance, decreasing error and improving functional outcomes; 2) decreased duration of open surgical wounds potentially reducing the rate of complications; and (3) enhanced and accelerated surgical workflows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve Mohs surgery and other margin screening applications. Using confocal image processing software, the proposed software will improve current pathology processing methods by enabling rapid processing and re-coloring of XVM images, visualization without the need for retraining, and automated detection of residual tumor at the patient’s bedside, all within minutes. The research described here will result in the production of a fully functional and robust software product through the following development projects: 1) Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software for image preprocessing and colorization/enhancement, and 2) AI-based software for automated identification of key morphological features and diagnosis of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The proposed technology will streamline cancer specimen processing, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses poor long-term public health outcomes stemming from lifestyle choices through an intuitive and effective tool to analyze and optimize their sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mental health. The technology will guide users through an individualized health and well-being analysis based on real-time data that presents an individualized baseline and heat map that helps individuals determine which lifestyle behaviors are most beneficial or detrimental towards their holistic health. This personalized approach seeks to establish new habits, interventions, medications, diets, etc.  This tool may help people to live longer and more fulfilled lives with fewer health concerns and costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project determines the viability of objective measurement of health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, sleep cycles, and exercise) through the integration of already-existent technologies including, but not limited to, wearables and “smart” technologies such as Smart Scales and Smart Blood Pressure cuffs. Additionally, this project will determine the viability of using subjective inputs surrounding diet, mood, and exercise and the ability to draw meaningful correlations between both subjective and objective inputs. This project will develop and validate methods to integrate these two data streams into a health scoring system that may be used to improve physical and mental health and fitness.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on scoliosis physiotherepy. Physiotherapy Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSEs) have been proved effective in treating scoliosis patients; However, PSSE effectiveness can be significantly reduced due to inappropriate planning, unclear requirements, and poor compliance. This project seeks to develop a hardware-software integrated system which employs a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to conduct PSSEs effectively. The technology may save costs for patients, expand services for clinics, and improve the outcomes of scoliosis physiotherapy. The commercialization of the technology will be conducted via business to business and business to customer mechanisms.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development a hardware-software integrated system which employs a patient digital twin (PDT) and a performance capture system to create a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to utilize telehealth communication between physiotherapists and scoliosis patients.  The technology seeks to improve the accuracy and completeness of diagnosis and assessment, optimize physiotherapy design and planning, facilitate effective patient communication and education, and help patients to perform physiotherapeutic exercises according to instructions and compliance requirements. By using PDT, the diagnosis of scoliosis and assessment of spine deformity can be performed in 3D space thus improving the completeness of assessment and the design of PSSEs. By building a light-weight performance capture system, body shape, pose, and motion can be captured in 3D space in real time. The teams seeks to represent the prescribed PSSEs in 3D games by animating the PDT with motion captured during clinic practice. In this way, the actual poses and motions of a patient during home exercise can be monitored, evaluated, and used to instruct with adjusted 3D games as reference. The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed innovation, which will be accomplished through a technical feasibility study, initial prototyping, and a commercial feasibility demonstration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities. This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper insights into their customers’ hair care-related goals, pain points, and health conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors (porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1) Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-esteem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve accessibility to robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotic TKA can improve implant positioning accuracy, enhance early functional rehabilitation, and reduce postoperative pain and time to hospital discharge. However, disruption in the operating room caused by current positional tracking systems impedes robotic utilization in TKA procedures. This Phase I project focuses on developing an inside-out tracking system that would free up valuable space in the operating room, eliminate line-of-sight concerns, possibly eliminate secondary incisions, and reduce the robotic system's overall cost. The distributors may be able to integrate this inside-out tracking system into any navigated or robotic surgical system that requires tracking bony anatomy (knee, hip, shoulder, or ankle arthroplasty and spinal or cranial procedures). This innovation targets the global orthopedic surgical robotic device market. The implementation of inside-out tracking may significantly improve the usability of surgical robots, improving their accessibility and, ultimately, improving outcomes for TKA patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an inside-out tracking system prototype that is appropriate for surgical bone tracking. Legacy commercial embodiments of inside-out tracking systems are not sufficiently compact and do not possess the necessary processing power for surgical applications. Recently, technological advances have made small form factor cameras with sufficient processing power to enable the realistic development of an inside-out tracking system for surgical robotic use accessible to developers at low cost. In this Phase I project, the team will demonstrate the feasibility of such a system through the following technical objectives: bench test commercial cameras and develop software to capture and process positional data in real-time; integrate an inside-out tracking system into a surgical robotic TKA system, and demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated system in a cadaver study to determine surgeon usability. Successful completion of this project may identify hardware and software that demonstrates the performance necessary for surgical applications and confirm the system's usability with surgeon users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the participation of the underrepresented population of blind and low vision (BLV) persons in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Through a novel assistive technology that provides BLV individuals with multisensory access to scientific data in real time, this technology will enable access  on par with sighted peers. BLV students, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data whether in the laboratory or in the field. This inaccessibility either precludes their full participation in hands-on science inquiry, or leaves them dependent on sighted peers to access real-time data. With this project, BLV students across K-12 and post-secondary institutions, as well as BLV scientists and others interested in STEM, will benefit from a tool that makes it possible for them to work independently in laboratory situations. This innovation will make science laboratory learning and laboratory workplaces more inclusive and equitable for the blind and low vision individuals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing a 2-dimensional, hand-held, portable, refreshable Braille and tactile graphics scientific data collection tool that can be used to collect quantifiable data in real time using wireless sensors. Blind and Low Vision (BLV) students are as capable as their sighted peers in STEM yet, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data in the laboratory. This effort seeks to address this inequity by leveraging the expertise of blind scientists and pioneers in STEM access technology to iteratively develop a interative versions of novel, blind-accessible innovations which will give BLV students, scientists and others access to quantitative data collected in the laboratory or in the field. This innovation will be optimized for the BLV by documenting usability concerns and making the necessary modifications to hardware and source-code prior to field-testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the accuracy, safety, and efficiency of pipe corrosion inspections for petrochemical and other manufacturing facilities. Pipe corrosion is a major issue, estimated to cost 3.4% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), and if left unmanaged, can result in catastrophic safety and economic incidents such as fatalities or fugitive gas emissions (which can total 13 million metric tons/year in oil and gas alone). Current methods to inspect pipe corrosion are expensive, slow, manual, and unable to collect all the necessary data requested by field engineers. The proposed robotic solution addresses these issues by: (1) improving safety and efficiency through improved inspection and localization mechanisms, (2) reducing the need for expensive and dangerous manual auxiliary inspection tasks such as scaffold construction and insulation removal, and (3) reporting significantly higher amounts of analytical data to allow improved decision making by corrosion engineers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of a new. highly-automated, robotic pipe inspection tool. Current inspection data is both difficult and manually-intensive to obtain. A novel pipe crawling robot has been created that enables automated inspection scans of pipes for a niche use case. Improvements in both onboard sensors and spatial positioning may enable widespread commercial adoption. The proposed research will improve the onboard sensor capabilities of the robot for improved corrosion detection uses and create an artificial intelligence-driven positioning system to improve locomotion, obstacle avoidance, and data integrity. Objective 1 requires both mechanical and electrical research, ranging from physical design challenges (including adhering to strict clearance, size, and weight requirements) to data processing experiments to regulatory research. Objective 2 encompasses research in autonomous movement, obstacle avoidance, and three-dimensional geometry reconstruction. The resulting robot may provide the industry with a safer and cheaper method of inspecting critical piping infrastructure, thus preventing potentially catastrophic safety and financial consequences and environmentally-detrimental leaks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lower the geohazard risks for assets within critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and utilities. More specifically, the proposed technology will make measuring and detecting ground motion with satellite radar more practical in applications where the observed areas cover very long distances and traverse varying terrain and land types. The innovation seeks to demonstrate that the combined processing of multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations can improve the information collected and that the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data can be used to aid insight. The efficacy of space-based satellite radar interferometry in measuring shifts in spatially-sensitive structures such as buried pipelines, foundations, and rail track ballast will be demonstrated over very large areas and linear distances. The technology developed in this project may have a positive impact on the aforementioned sectors by enabling monitoring capabilities that are timelier and more cost-effective than traditional approaches. The geospatial technology may also enable asset operators to be more proactive when it comes to geohazard threats, lowering the frequency of fatal and environmentally-damaging failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the key shortcomings of space-based satellite radar interferometry as a means to monitor surface motion threats to critical infrastructure assets. While interferometric approaches for specific types of terrain have been well documented and validated, approaches that produce coherent ground motion results over very large areas with varying terrain and radar scattering mechanisms have not been successfully deployed. Furthermore, combining multiple interferometric observations together to decompose ground motion has received little research attention despite being an important step in translating the relative line-of-sight satellite observations into ground motion components relevant to asset monitoring. This research effort seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of using multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations and combining their interferometric results to create a more continuous view of ground motion over areas with varying degrees of vegetation. This project may also demonstrate that combining both small baseline subset and persistent scatter interferometric approaches can improve the density of resolved scatterers over areas where land type variations create a diverse range of scattering mechanisms. The team also seeks to  demonstrate the use and accuracy of GNSS data in the reference setting process as insights are translated into absolute motion components about the geodetic reference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a low-cost, flexible, Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Label that is self-powered in all lighted conditions. This Smart Label can be directly attached to packages, shipments, buildings, or worn as a medical device, enabling real-time data with improved accuracy. Sensing labels and asset trackers are extensively used to control inventories and monitor the freshness, quality, safety, and shelf life of perishable goods, as well as pharmaceuticals, foods, healthcare samples, and more. Existing radiofrequency identification (RFID) smart labels have no energy storage or energy harvesting capability. Current asset trackers have rechargeable batteries, with some powered by silicon-based photovoltaics which have poor indoor light performance. This project integrates organic photovoltaics (OPV) into flexible smart labels for continuous power supply under indoor and outdoor light, allowing frequent transmission of data to the cloud. OPV technology will be uniquely tuned to the common indoor light spectra to deliver light-to-electricity performance values over 20%, twice the indoor light performance of the best commercially available silicon photovoltaics. This program will combine flexible OPV with flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) to create a low-cost, flexible, thin, light-weight, and credit-card-sized IoT device with onboard sensors and radios for continuous wireless communication.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a continuously-operating flexible IoT device for flexible IoT smart labels on packaging, asset tracking, and in retail. The current limitations to a completely flexible, OPV-powered IoT device are: (1) OPV has not been specifically tuned to the light emitting diode (LED) spectrum; (2) OPV has not been attached to FHE before; and (3) IoT-Smart-Label-integrated OPV has not existed in production before. Attaching the FHE to OPV is the most significant technical risk, so the goal of this project is to validate flexible OPV-powered IoT smart labels as a viable product, delivering three proof-of-concept prototypes. To achieve this primary goal, the objectives are divided into groups based on eight key elements: (1) develope OPV sheet for printed electronics integration, (2) demonstrate printed device circuits and antenna on the backside of OPV sheets, (3) determine ideal power management chip for conversion to flex-compatible form factor, (4) place and integrate silicon chips, (5) integrate and test the flexible batteries, (6) package/laminate the entire flex label, (7) demonstrate wireless data transfer from the flex IoT device to the cloud, and (8) develop roadmap for manufacturing scale-up in Phase II, including an estimate of scaled-up product cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address many of the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons that have, to date, prevented the widespread usefulness of this technology for targeted remote sensing applications. Traditional stratospheric balloons are massive and difficult to operate. They are often hundreds of feet tall, weigh thousands of pounds, costs tens of thousands of dollars, must be launched from fixed locations in near-perfect weather, and are always one-time use. These technical, operational, and financial limitations have led to a largely underutilized stratospheric environment. The first proposed research objective for this effort is the design completion of a small, mobile-launch, durable, and fully reusable altitude stable stratospheric balloon. The second research objective is the design and development of advanced balloon flight trajectory software needed to identify acceptable balloon launch sites that yield successful, targeted remote sensing missions. The third objective is the development of a rapid, mobile-launch platform. The project will culminate with a stratospheric flight test campaign that may demonstrate the combined system innovations, measured by the system’s overall ability to image pre-determined target areas of interest at specified times.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance stratospheric remote sensing technologies while enabling safe, routine, and commercially-viable Earth observation from a stratospheric balloon platform. The stratosphere is relatively void of commercial remote sensing activity, largely due to the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons. Today, stratospheric balloons are commercially unviable for remote sensing applications due to their inability to image specific areas of Earth at desired times, largely due to constraints associated with the need for fixed launch infrastructure, a lack of system directional control, and narrow operational launch windows requiring restrictive launch weather conditions. The novel stratospheric remote sensing balloon that is the subject of this effort may reduce or eliminate many of these constraints, resulting in a zero-emission, mobile-launch, precisely-placeable stratospheric remote sensing balloon that will enable high-resolution, targeted, low-cost Earth observation. This effort may enhance scientific and technological understanding of small stratospheric balloon systems for remote sensing applications and, most importantly, may enable widespread commercial usefulness of the stratosphere for remote sensing applications including remote, real-time wildfire monitoring and rapid, broad-area disaster response awareness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve standards for safety-critical connectivity of drones flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The drone communication market requires superior link reliability to BVLOS drone applications at an affordable price. The proposed technologies seek to control BVLOS operations enabling improved safety and increased trust in autonomous airspace systems from both regulatory authorities and society. Network-based solutions to improve airborne links require costly enhancements to the network and a large number of drone devices to be profitable. The team is focused on solving aerial command and control problems using the current mobile network; The technology seeks full integration with the 5G network and compatibility with subsequent network generations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and de-risk the connection reliability enhancement algorithms for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drones, enhancing connection reliability. The technological improvements allow use of any network generation (2G/3G/4G/5G), delivering connection reliability to 95% of the global population. The team has three enabling innovations: 1) voice channel communication redundancy which translates commands into audio signals transmitted over the voice channel, 2) an algorithm for handover (HO) optimization which minimizes ping-pong HO, radio link failures (RLF) and connection losses, and 3) safe route planning which allows drone operators to select the best route for reliable connectivity given the network circumstances.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel artificial intelligence technology that enables U.S. corn farmers to optimize nitrogen fertilizer applications based on field characteristics, rainfall and growing conditions. More efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer will reduce the carbon footprint of U.S. agriculture because more than 10% of the energy consumed in the U.S. agricultural sector goes toward the production of nitrogen fertilizer for corn. Because nitrogen fertilizer is a critical driver of both input costs and yield, this technology will improve the profitability of U.S. farmers by reducing input costs and maximizing corn yields. This project may enable corn production that creates less nitrogen fertilizer pollution, which threatens human health, degrades aquatic ecosystems and emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. A key social element of this project is a teaching module for middle-school science students that will blend content on soil science, agronomy, and crop management with the challenges faced by U.S. corn farmers to follow best management practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using machine learning to evaluate the amount of yellowness on the lowest corn leaves visible in images taken from low-cost cameras mounted on ground robots. Characteristic yellowness on corn leaves is a strong indicator of stress caused by insufficient nitrogen, a key nutrient. A prototype neural network model will be iteratively improved, in part by dramatically increasing the available training imagery over the course of this Phase I project. Imagery will be collected on field trials set up across several Mid-Western states. Preliminary data suggest that the extent of characteristic yellowness is an indicator of accumulated nitrogen stress that is observable only under the canopy and not via airborne sensors. A commercially available nitrogen model will be used to estimate accumulated nitrogen stress across small plots created by manipulating the amount of added nitrogen fertilizer when corn is about 1-2 feet high. Tuning will occur by adjusting key model parameters through simulation until the differences are minimized between observed and modeled accumulated nitrogen stress across a field’s small plots. Parallel software development will improve prototype codes running simulations of a leading nitrogen model, enabling rapid model tuning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop autonomous, ocean-going cargo vessels powered by a combination of wind and solar power. These vessels will enable the provision of cheaper and more frequent sea freight service to isolated communities, such as those in coastal Alaska. The technology seeks to the lower operating costs by removing liquid or solid fuels or onboard crew, enabling the vessels to be more readily right-sized to particular routes and markets. The project may also have positive impacts on the environment by eliminating fossil fuel emissions and reducing marine noise impacts on wildlife, such as marine mammals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate existing robotic and energy capture technologies with newly developed wind/solar combined energy optimization software and autonomous contingency management. A vessel using both the wind and sun for propulsion has a difficult energy optimization problem, both on a minute-to-minute basis but also on the scale of an entire voyage; This project will build a model for solving this intermitancy problem given specific vessel performance characteristics and weather predictions. Likewise, this project will build a framework for addressing the autonomous contingency management problem for uncrewed marine surface vehicles given a particular set of vehicle and system characteristics. The focus will be on ship-to-shore communications contingencies because those are the most serious for the contemplated target system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enhance the understanding of wireless mesh networks and deep reinforcement learning algorithms in order to significantly expand the coverage and robustness, accelerating Internet of Things (IoT) adoption across the globe. These improvements to sensor systems seek to benefit a range of applications including public safety, smart agriculture, supply chain logistics, smart cities, wildlife monitoring, healthcare and other markets. The coverage and cost benefits are especially impactful for the U.S population in rural or economically-disadvantaged areas that lack cost effective connectivity and are unable to take advantage of the IoT benefits. Further, the project will enhance industry-academia partnership, enable the technology transition of innovations, and expand the participation of women in science, technology, enducation and mathematics (STEM).


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable scalable, longer-lasting, and higher-throughput Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) Internet of Things (IoT) networks by using LPWA IoT Mesh Augmentation (LIMA) devices to augment the connectivity between end-nodes and gateways in a cost-effective and easy-to-deploy manner. The mesh network of LIMA devices will adaptively multi-hop relay messages to maximize effective capacity and range. The teams seeks to augment the connectivity of LoRaWAN (a standard for Long Range Wide Area Networks) with a goal of increasing coverage range several-fold, reducing the battery drain of end-nodes, and enabling higher uplink bitrates. The core challenge for such LIMA is the development of a scalable multi-hop mesh routing protocol that, unlike existing protocols, accommodates the ultra-low bit rates that characterize LPWANs, and is generalizable across the diverse applications of LPWAN technology. The LIMA solution builds upon two synergistic innovations: (a) embedded-control routing, that uses a very small amount of bits in the data packet header in lieu of control packets, and thereby achieves scalability and energy-efficiency in ultra-low-capacity, energy-constrained networks and (b) relational deep reinforcement learning based routing that combines Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks (DeepRL) with the use of relational features to learn routing policies that adapt to a variety of link dynamics and traffic conditions. The LIMA solution does not require changes to end-nodes. The anticipated technical deliverables include mesh networking software, a simulation model, a 4-node prototype using a LoRa integrated circuit, and experimental analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reducing the cost of getting people online and connecting people in emergency situations such as natural disasters. Natural disasters often destroy cellular networks, exactly when people need communication the most. The influx of users on the limited remaining infrastructure often overwhelms existing resources, making it impossible for first responders to coordinate, for families to call their loved ones, and for volunteers to help. In other potential markets, the technology seeks to provide cellular phone access to parts of the world where it is now prohibitively expensive. This project seeks to develop small, portable cellular base stations that can provide access in both emergency and hard to reach and poorly resourced locations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project researches and implements a small, portable cellular base station. The technological focus for the base station utilizes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (or 2G and 2.5G) radio for communicating with a high density of cell phones in a computationally cheap manner while utilizing WiFi for local, high bandwidth applications. The technology implements many “micro-cells” in lieu of the current macro cell approach to cellular coverage, blanketing the area with a high number of towers. This decentralized approach provides high reliability even if one or several nodes fail. This project will develop the algorithms necessary for interconnecting large numbers of base stations together and mesh the networking capabilities that provide radio links between each base station. Finally, this project will finalize the mechanical design and make the base station manufacturable at large scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration with a new type of three-dimensional (3D) sensor. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate in densely crowded spaces in a safe and socially compliant/acceptable manner. A key potential outcome is the development of a collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).  This method would be capable of handling dense crowds and optimized to run on compact and power-efficient embedded processors. Such abilities would increase the commercial potential and adoption of learning-based navigation methods that have demonstrated excellent collision avoidance and noise handling capabilities. The technology may unlock commercial opportunities by deploying AMRs in the airport, retail, healthcare, and hospitality industries, where the environments are highly dense and dynamic. The airport industry may derive postive impacts from AMRs that can navigate in complex, indoor environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are not allowed by providing contactless deliveries of food, beverages, and other retail products to travelers at the gate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a hybrid collision avoidance approach enabling autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate safely in dense crowds, while being socially-compliant in sparse scenarios. Preliminary research has shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches can compute collision-free robot velocities with inaccurate, uncertain perception data. The proposed DRL-based model will be implemented as an optimized neural network that works on power and cost-efficient embedded processors.  The key technical hurdles in this technology are: the DRL model trained in simulation may not perform well in real-world environments (known as sim-to-real gap), the fully-trained DRL model may have some performance degradation compared to the company’s current DRL models due to the lower number of parameters used to run on embedded processors, and the localization modules could compute erroneous locations when the AMR is navigating through a dense crowd due to occlusions. The key objectives of Phase I are to address these challenges.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to create a viable microwave device for\
    \ material processing on the Moon and other planetary bodies. The innovation may\
    \ reduce the effort required to extract ice volatiles from inside solid materials\
    \ by 2-3 times compared to current lunar excavation methods and could be used\
    \ without preconditioning.  Lunar extraction may reduce the cost of obtaining\
    \ essential materials on the surface of the Moon by an order of magnitude, compared\
    \ to supply from the Earth. Such a technology will have two key societal impacts.\
    \ First, as human populations continue to expand, critical resources on Earth\
    \ are becoming increasingly scarce and having another extra-terrestrial source\
    \ may provide the resources needed on Earth. Second, the development of a space\
    \ resource-use ecosystem may catalyze technical education, interest, and economic\
    \ development in addition to fueling continued Gross National Product (GDP) growth.\
    \ Accessing water cheaply in the lunar and near-Earth environment to produce mission-critical\
    \ water, hydrogen, and oxygen, is essential for this outcome.  \n\nThis Small\
    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to design a high-power\

    \ the preconditioning or softening of materials by supplying impulses of energy\
    \ at high rates. The innovation distinguishes itself due to the ability to focus\
    \ high density energy from a stand-off distance. The research involves the investigation\
    \ of the subcomponents of the system to address expected capabilities which include:\
    \ the ability to project a “pencil beam” from a stand-off distance using a multi-reflector\
    \ assembly, tolerance of the surface properties of the materials being treated,\
    \ and electronic steering of the projected beam using phase shifting to improve\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the reduction of honey bee colony mortality by up to 75% through early identification and improved breeding of pest- and disease-resistant colonies. Honey bees are dying at unprecedented rates, with annual losses up to 45% in the United States. A primary cause of colony death is the parasitic mite Varroa. The unhealthy brood odor (UBO) assay is a pheromone-based tool that reduces labor costs required to measure Varroa-resistance by 18x, accelerating decision-making by 20%. The assay’s user-friendly design makes honey bee selection and queen evaluation more accessible to beekeepers, who are often restricted by the high technical skill and/or extensive labor required for existing assays. The UBO assay has potential to improve honey bee health and increase profitability of beekeeping operations, and thus may significantly improve global crop pollination and food security.

    The proposed project will assess the technical feasibility of using a honey bee pheromone-based assay to predict colony-level disease- and pest-resistance. This novel tool has the potential to improve honey bee health, revolutionize honey bee breeding, and inform important apiary management decisions, as it improves efficiency and efficacy of honey bee selection by enabling rapid and accurate identification of Varroa-resistant honey bee colonies. However, to be highly effective and achieve widespread uptake the technology must be practically and economically accessible, must perform consistently despite environmental variability, and must be established as a reliable indicator of heritable Varroa-resistance traits. The proposed research will employ sophisticated behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery, reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of Varroa-resistance traits identified by colony response to the prototype assay. Expected results include improvements to the safety and efficiency of the product delivery system, improved understanding of the effects of environmental variability on product performance, and confirmation of the heritability of traits identified by honey bee behavioral response to in-hive tests of the product.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve reuse of wastewater.  This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.

    The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities—by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is enhancing the role of metabolite (substances used by cells for growth, reproduction and health) analysis in the growing area of systems biology research. This is expected to lead to faster and less expensive biomarker and drug discovery to allow for more accurate, reproducible, and faster clinical trials, and to accelerate basic scientific research into many areas of cellular and system-wide organismal studies. This will have a significant impact on the bottom line for drug companies and for improving health and reducing health care cost. The innovation will provide customers with a platform and expertise that enable them to increase their ability to develop biomarkers and drugs faster by: (1) allowing more metabolites to be involved in the discovery of new relationships between diseases and metabolites, potentially opening up new areas of basic research; (2) selecting disease-associated metabolites on the basis of not only statistically significant changes in metabolite levels but also correlations of interactions among metabolites in diseased vs. healthy cells; and (3) evaluating the relationships between metabolites and diseases through integration of metabolite analysis with other system-wide analytical methods (i.e. gene expression, protein levels, etc.).

    The proposed project seeks to develop an innovative cloud-based platform with an interactive modular interface that allows users to easily build customized pipelines for analysis of untargeted metabolomics data. The platform will empower the opportunity to increase the number of annotated analytes and to integrate metabolomics with other omics data, thereby enhancing the involvement of metabolomics in systems biology-based biomarker and drug discovery studies. Despite a large accumulation of metabolomics data acquired over the past several years, effective use of these data for biomarker and drug discovery has been very limited. These challenges are in part due to the lack of effective tools that: (1) accurately determine the identity of disease-associated analytes; (2) help investigate the rewiring and conserved interactions among metabolites in the progression of disease; and (3) integrate multi-omics data to evaluate the relationship between metabolites and diseases at the systems level. This project will advance scientific knowledge by investigating and evaluating innovative computational methods for metabolite annotation, differential analysis of metabolite profiles, and multi-omics data integration. Furthermore, the project will lead to a cloud-based platform that enables users to build their desired data analysis workflow or pipeline by choosing from several innovative modules to analyze metabolomics data.

    The Broader Impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support widespread distribution and adoption of sterilizing biopesticides that are effective and efficient to control Lepidoptera. Lepidopterans, such as the corn earworm, circumvent insecticidal properties of certain crops by developing resistance.  Models show that incorporating sterile insects in a corn earworm population can suppress the incidence of resistant individuals in the populations.  Enhancing oral infectivity of this sterilizing insect biopesticide will improve product manufacturing, distribution and most importantly, ease of use to support farmer adoption.

    The proposed project develops a functional orally-infectious formula of a specific strain of the sexually-transmitted, sterilizing-virus, Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV2). The resulting technology will be suitable for prototyping and testing oral formulations for sterilizing adult corn earworm moths. Genetic selection and candidate gene approaches are proposed to improve stability of the virus entry complex required for oral infectivity. This project will decorate viral envelopes with genes absent from HzNV-2 and thereby improve virion stability.  The pseudotyped virus will be assayed for increased oral infectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).  Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.  This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.

    The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.  The project will develop a test to measures a compound's biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology platform for storing biological materials that will improve public health outcomes and enable the storage of the ever-expanding digital data universe. Nucleic acids are the new bits of the 21st century; they encode our health and can be repurposed as alternative storage media for digital data. Harnessing the information encoded in these biological materials requires a scalable way to store and access nucleic acids. For decades, we have relied on energy-intensive low-temperature storage and expensive robotics to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids, which are not scalable. The successful outcome of this proposal is an alternative solution to store massive amounts of nucleic acids, obviating the need for freezers and enabling new products that leverage nucleic acid materials.

    The proposed project will lay the foundation for developing a low-cost scalable solution for nucleic acid materials. Current approaches are limited by the requirement of low temperature to circumvent the degradation of nucleic acids, requiring a constant supply of electricity and expensive robotics. Instead, the proposed project focuses on maintaining the integrity of nucleic acids for decades at room temperature and simultaneously enabling search and retrieval functions akin to a computer or internet search engine by leveraging the rapid diffusion of molecules in solution. This ambitious goal will be achieved by using novel synthetic polymers that are made compatible with biological materials to enable rapid encapsulation of nucleic acids while providing long-term protection without the need for low temperature. The resulting synthetic polymers discovered through the project will be tested using purified nucleic acids, including animal, bacterial, or viral genomes, to demonstrate the capabilities and breadth of materials that can be used for the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project addresses a paradox faced by ‘open web’ developers, users, and regulators: the use of centralized platform-creator hosted web portals to interact with an evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) application ecosystem. The proposed work will instrument a new open web paradigm that will improve user accessibility and ability to compose and perform data analysis on smart contracts. The approach will enable improvement of web-service reliability and security while weeding out bad actors.  Improving the accessibility and analysis of smart contracts is anticipated to help unlock further value and solutions across a range of applications and new business opportunities that can benefit from dynamic contracting.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build a blockchain-adjacent metadata model that enhances the utility and security of smart contracts for users and developers. The project will undertake the practical challenge of reverse-engineering smart contracts to outline a metadata model which will enhance discovery and security of services, creating a scaffold for composable apps. The approach will organize blockchain abstractions through code similarity analysis and program de-obfuscation by reverse engineering, instrument compile-time creation and publish metadata models by developers, and demonstrate how this data can be used to build a composable app user experience. The project will deploy privacy-preserving targeted advertising frameworks using deterministic services alongside the data from the metadata model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of lightweight, thermally safe batteries with high energy densities that can be charged fast, last a long time, are composed of environmentally benign materials, and can store energy at a low cost. Such batteries would enable the large-scale penetration of long-range electric cars and other electric vehicles, including airplanes and drones in transportation.  This process reduces environmental pollution and leads to greater energy efficiency.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to use boron nitride based layered ceramic materials as a means of storing electrochemical energy in solid state batteries.  This project enhances scientific and technological understanding on the design of advanced functional materials for energy storage at the atomic level.  To achieve the targeted high performance energy storage at the macroscopic level, the underlying material structures must be carefully selected on the atomic and molecular levels.  Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, may contain functional groups that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized and can be utilized as electroactive species in cathodes of rechargeable batteries. The great advantage of these materials is that they can realize simultaneously high energy and power density for thousands of charging/discharging cycles as demonstrated in graphene oxide batteries with lithium and sodium anodes.  Graphene oxide is, however, thermally unstable.  The project proposes to substitute graphene oxide with functionalized boron nitride in order to achieve thermal stability while preserving performance.  Furthermore, the functionalized boron nitride is also capable to play the role of a solid electrolyte in addition to being an electroactive species.  Particular focus will be made on synthesizing -OBF3 functionalized boron nitride. This functional group occurs as a Lewis adduct of surface oxides (such as graphene oxide or boron nitride oxide) with BF3 (an electrolyte component) and is particularly promising as a compact electroactive species and electrolyte.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide an efficient, automated biopsy diagnostic process which will allow patients to access high quality cancer diagnostics at lower cost and without being subjected to unnecessary and painful repeat procedures from inefficient biopsy processes. The innovation addresses a critical global need to improve the efficiency and analytics of biopsies. An automated, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) system will potentially eliminate the 20% fail-rate of fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy sampling. The application may also be scaled to provide a solution to facilities that may not be able to afford the rapid onsite evaluation service of FNA.

    The proposed project aims to provide an automated, rapid on-site evaluation process by leveraging a system-engaging technology and robotics to increase fine needle aspiration biopsy sampling efficiency and improve patient experience, while reducing costs to ensure accessibility to all facilities. This device will have three processes to produce an image-ready glass slide that a pathologist can access remotely and render an adequacy assessment. The device will perform smearing, staining, and image capture of a fine needle aspiration biopsy sample. Normally, these processes are performed by a pathologist/cytotechnologist, making rapid on-site evaluation service inaccessible to fine needle aspiration providers in most rural or small facilities. With an automated device, the rapid on-site evaluation service may be mroe readily available and accessible at a fraction of cost, saving time and resources for patients and medical providers.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a wound care product to heal bed sores or pressure ulcers (PUs). Over 2.5 million Americans, usually older adults, suffer from PUs annually. PUs can be deep wounds, take many months to heal, cause significant pain; if infected, they can lead to sepsis and death. The annual U.S. cost for treatment of all PUs is estimated to be greater than $11 billion. Current treatment options involve surgical reconstruction with skin or skin substitute grafts, which can fail to heal the pressure ulcer because of infection or because the graft was not strong enough. To address these issues, the proposed project will develop a novel skin substitute that is pro-regenerative, stronger, and releases infection-fighting drugs at the surgical site to allow healing. This could benefit physicians and hospitals treating patients with stage II-III PUs (58% of all PUs); the 3-year market potential is over $150 million. The underlying technology of the proposed solution can be used to make novel grafts for treatment of numerous wound types, improving healing and patient quality of life.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of this drug-loaded, polymer-impregnated acellular biologic graft (ABG) platform technology. Currently, PUs are surgically reconstructed using skin or skin substitute grafts, like ABGs, which often fail due to infection or lack of mechanical strength. By embedding a polymer hydrogel within an ABG, it can be mechanically strengthened. Furthermore, mixing the polymer with drugs (drug+polyABG) enables a drug delivery system that provides sustained, local release of therapeutic agents such as anti-infectives over a 14-day period. This novel approach simultaneously provides an allogeneic scaffold for patient-mediated tissue regeneration and counters onset of common complications during wound healing. This biocompatible polymer impregnation of ABGs for therapeutic applications has not been performed previously. This Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility drug+polyABG by (1) characterizing drug release and bioactivity in vitro and (2) assessing efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of single-stage reconstruction of stage II-III PUs challenged with topical MRSA.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content is commonly limited to very short clips (typically < 10 seconds) due to huge file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices. both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment and telecommunications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable. The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time. There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard HD video content.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of semiconductor chips.  Specifically, it develops a novel method to operate directly on compressed data, saving time, energy, and latency.  This improved performance will affect computationally intensive applications such as medical imaging (e.g., CT/MRI), climate simulation, hurricane warnings, and earthquake alerts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a method to operate on compressed data. Today, computers apply data compression to identify and remove redundancy in the data in order to save storage space.  Computers apply arithmetic to compute in integers or real numbers (usually represented internally as floating-point data).  However, today's computers first decompress the data, compute, and then compress the computed result, consuming additional time and energy.  This project develops an arithmetic and math hardware accelerator capable of processing compressed data directly to dramatically improve computation performance, storage effectiveness, and energy efficiency.  This project combines data compression and floating-point engineering to deliver the first-ever Compressed Floating-Point Unit (CFPU) that minimizes semiconductor and energy usage and reduces computation latency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safe, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy storage solution.  This project offers a non-chemical, non-hazardous alternative energy storage to accelerate grid modernization and non-polluting renewable power integration.  The project’s core technology is a design that is cost competitive with deployed Lithium ion (Li-ion) chemical batteries, but would be significantly less expensive per charge than Li-ion over its 30+ year service life.  This proposed approach allows the long-term advantages of kinetic (flywheel) energy storage (low service life costs, high power throughput, high daily charge cycles, no battery replacements, potential for 24/7 operations) and makes it affordable and safer for deployed stationary grid operations. With solar and wind renewables on par with traditional carbon-based power generation costs, affordable flywheel energy storage is vital to store and dispense intermittent renewable power, enabling the replacement of carbon-based power generation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a comprehensive testing effort to verify the technical feasibility of the project’s 3D flywheel composite structure for next-generation energy storage systems. The proposed research and testing objectives are to demonstrate the improved 3D flywheel performance and projected 9x reduction in the traditional flywheel weight for the same energy storage capability. Testing methodology includes dynamic balancing, torque transmission determination, critical failure/fatigue modeling, assessing magnetically coupled commercial external motor/generator power transmission and performance in a TRL-5 operational vacuum environment. The effort will also include energy storage market analysis for commercial market entry based on tested 3D flywheel performance. Anticipated results include the characterization of the 3D flywheel structural technology, demonstrated commercial subsystem operations and readiness to develop a full prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to improve the assessment of cognitive and motor skills in K-6 students. More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to enhance the health of livestock without addition of synthetic antibiotic and antioxidant compounds. The proposed technologies are corn kernel fiber byproducts of ethanol production from corn. The need for such compounds has grown as livestock is now more often raised in concentrated animal feeding operations that confine animals and result in abnormal oxidative stress. The program is based on extracting these naturally occurring compounds from agricultural residues.  These extracts can be used in place of antibiotics and synthetic supplements currently in livestock feeds.  The process proposed will enable production at a cost competitive with synthetic supplements.

    This STTR project proposes to assess the biological activity of hydroxy cinnamic acids and their oligomers (HCAs) as beneficial supplements in livestock feed. They are ester-linked to a hemicellulose known to occur in seed crop brans. The linkage is hydrolyzed during pretreatment of corn bran fiber to prepare it for conversion to ethanol and the HCAs dissolve in the pretreatment solution. As free acids they recover their character, which includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The project will provide kilogram quantities of HCAs for use in feeding trials with young swine, wherein they will be compared with naturally sourced feed supplements currently in use in Europe, as well as un-supplemented feed. Components of the extract will be identified and comprehensive biochemical analyses performed, including study of the gastrointestinal physiology and intestinal permeability. Studies will also be performed of gut microbiomes and how the processes involved are influenced by substitution of HCAs as the primary feed supplement. Successful completion of these studies will provide a basis for more comprehensive studies of the use of HCAs as supplements in the diet of other livestock.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide open and secure management of transactions between multiple parties in a supply chain. The lack of transparent information throughout the supply chain has eroded the trust and value of many perishable products and the brands they represent. The proposed project addresses the current issue of tracking and traceability of food products in a trusted manner. Through the development of a hybrid blockchain that is sensor aware, all the parties involved in the distribution of the goods will ensure that the food quality is maintained by entering transactions into a secure blockchain. The result is two-fold: consumers will be assured that they are getting the right goods and suppliers can trust that their products are being delivered with quality. While initially focused on the $2 billion food transaction market, the commercial potential will expand to a broader range of products that require secure traceability including consumer goods, home delivery and medical products.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the core technology for the hybrid blockchain and test the functionality in a live commercial setting. The technology represents the first-in-class solution that leverages blockchain and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with integrated sensor and hybrid datasets to address the perishable nature of food products. The blockchain model will assume that a transaction is an event of data transfer and that there can be many disjointed events even on a small-scale supply chain network. For traceability, novel algorithms will be designed, making it feasible to connect disjointed events using geometry and a pseudo-Boolean function on top of a system that assigns a unique code. This implementation uses multivariate time series and node features for the meaningful aggregation and disaggregation of datasets, such as data collected by sensors and participating members. Putting such multivariate time series on the graph where participants are nodes with their pairwise relations as edges, the technology will address the novel optimization problem for efficient real-time monitoring and assist in providing further assurance of transaction integrity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project improves the use of large-scale databases, data warehouses, and the software that used to commercially data-mine these resources.  In the era of big data, many applications, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, critically rely on data functionalities including efficiency, interoperability, and analysis. However, their data subsystems are challenged to meet these needs due to multiple technical limitations, such as centralized storage, homogeneous data formats, and tightly coupled workflows. This STTR project will develop a new framework to overcome these limitations to improve big data applications in various scientific fields, such as biological sciences, astronomy, and computational chemistry.  At the end of this Phase I project, the requisite knowledge and foundational materials for developing a blockchain-based data warehousing middleware will be produced.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to advance the specific knowledge and commercialization of DLTs (Distributed Ledger Technologies) and blockchains by creating novel and innovative environments for further development for DLTs and blockchains as a "virtuous cycle", starting with bottlenecks identified in modern data warehouses. The DLT tool developed here advances blockchain protocols, specifically for removing quadratic and speculative costs from orthodox protocol-based approaches to blockchains on conventional hardware and instituting linearizable and constant costs with other innovative programming methods (e.g., probabilistic pruning). New statistical, topological, and computational approaches will be researched and developed for these purposes, including for development of techniques applicable for machine learning, artificial intelligence, peta-scale and exa-scale computing, advanced scientific computing, and pedagogical academic development of future generations. The expected results include a new set of protocols and a unified tool for integrating data types and multiple networks into conventional data warehouses, especially for advancement of data warehouses struggling to keep pace with new blockchain data, metadata, and real-time analytics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve lowering the barrier to adoption of renewable energy generation and energy storage. The project seeks to take advantage the sheer abundance and low costs of sodium materials compared to state-of-the-art lithium materials. This will reduce upfront energy storage cost and in turn the payback time and costs of electricity for end users can be significantly reduced. The United States has 23 billion tons of domestic sodium reserves, which makes up 88% of the global supply of sodium. Successful utilization of the vast U.S. sodium reserves in new battery technologies will significantly reduce import reliance of critical materials and alleviate supply chain limitations on lithium-based materials. This project will accelerate the adoption of solar and renewable energy generation, making the grid cleaner, more sustainable, and more resilient.

    This research project advances new batteries enabled by a novel halide-based sodium solid state electrolyte. The technology offers several beneficial properties compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries: enhanced safety due to the use of completely nonflammable materials, higher volumetric energy density by using a dense alloy-based anode, lowered costs due to the abundance of sodium-based raw materials, and improved longevity from the use of superior halide-based solid-state electrolytes. Unlike the commonly used sulfide-based or oxide-based solid electrolyte materials, the halide-based innovation provides enhanced electrochemical and chemical stability while eliminating the need for high temperature sintering during fabrication. This project develops the halide solid electrolyte material, improving its baseline material ionic conductivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, as well as exploring scalable synthesis routes using single-step fabrication at room temperature.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new class of batteries for transportation. The proposed battery design will maximize the rate of charge and battery lifetime while maintaining high energy density, in contrast with current battery research that primarily focuses on maximizing energy density. This new operating parameter will open the design space for smaller batteries that result in lighter weight, lower cost and longer life vehicle platforms to enable all-electric transportation. In addition, the new operating parameters enable the widespread adoption of two new applications, (i) vehicle to grid and (ii) mobility as a service. The associated reduction of greenhouse gases will be 1+ gigaton annually.

    The proposed project develops a lithium battery coin cell that demonstrates 3 minutes ultrafast charge and 20,000 extended cycle life performance, using the novel disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode. This project explores ultrafast charge lithium ion battery platforms.  Technical objectives include: 1) charging times comparable to filling up today's gas tanks; 2) batteries with a higher safety profile that last the entire service life of the vehicle; 3) vehicles that can connect to the electric grid for renewables integration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.

    The SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve capacitor technology in power conversion equipment used to electrify our transportation systems. Capacitors are critical components to the systems needed to accelerate the energy transition from petroleum to other fuels. This project will develop new electrical materials and production processes for capacitors. The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles. Through development of these new electrode materials and processes, manufacturing of capacitors in the United States will be available to serve the growing US electric vehicle industry.

    This goal of the proposed work is to develop electrode materials and roll-to-roll processes compatible with an integrated, continuous manufacturing process for multilayer capacitor products. By combining additive manufacturing process in a roll-to-roll system, sequential deposition, drying, and curing of alternating layers of dielectrics and electrodes will enable production of multilayer capacitors in a single system at atmospheric pressure. Electrode inks and printing processes used in flexible/hybrid electronics do not meet the specifications to replace vacuum-based evaporation or sputtering of thin electrode layers for capacitor applications. The primary approach will be based on adapting the layer coating and alignment techniques developed for dielectrics to conductive materials. These electrode materials will improve upon state-of-the-art conductive inks with poor interfaces between particles to produce dense layers with uniform thickness and low surface roughness. This project seeks to provide prototyping of multilayer capacitors produced in discrete processing steps for verification of electrical performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to address a significant pain point for farmers associated with reducing nitrogen fertilizer input costs. The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer.  These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative method to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). UGIB results in more than 550,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone with a mortality rate of up to 20%. The gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding market is projected to be nearly USD 1 billion by 2026, with the overall hemostatic agents market reaching over USD 5 billion. Current solutions require endoscopy performed by a specialist or hospital admission. The proposed approach is a drinkable formulation to stop bleeding after ingestion, eliminating the need for endoscopic intervention or hospitalization. The technology developed in this project could then be applied to other bleeding scenarios, including field/combat medicine or rapid treatment of hemorrhage during surgical complications. The gel can also be used as a drug delivery vehicle for a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new approach to achieve hemostasis in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), based on a novel thermosensitive gel (thermogel) formulation. The drinkable formulation is liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a mucoadhesive gel when warmed to body temperature, thereby treating hemorrhage in the upper GI tract without the need for endoscopic intervention. Its action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) The in situ gelation of the mucoadhesive thermogel provides a mechanical barrier against blood flow, and (2) the slow release of drugs from the thermogel at the hemorrhage site enables more rapid healing. Initial efforts will be dedicated to formulation development wherein compatibility of the thermogel with different drug candidates will be evaluated, and optimization of the gelation temperature will be performed. The best formulations will then be tested in vitro for stability, drug release kinetics, and mucoadhesion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach will be assessed in preclinical models of bleeding, demonstrating its superior ability to reach hemostasis. This is expected to apply to disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and oral mucositis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project supports the development of a medical device that enables minimally invasive graft-based reconstruction of the urethra as a long-lasting treatment for male urethral stricture, a class of conditions causing restrictions in flow. Approximately 1% of men on Medicare are treated for stricture annually, and an estimated 1 in 5 men will get a stricture in their lifetime. A urethral stricture progressively narrows the urethra - leading to urinary urgency, frequent and painful urination, and impaired intimacy. The current state of practice has many challenges:  Widely available endoscopic treatment is simple and minimally invasive but rarely curative, with high recurrence rates, and repeated endoscopic intervention worsens the stricture and turns a curable condition into a chronic disease, with devastating consequences to quality of life. Graft-based urethral reconstruction has excellent long-term outcomes but limited availability – as the complex open surgery is performed by a select group of reconstructive urologists. The proposed medical device simplifies minimally invasive graft-based urethral reconstruction to empower general urologists to deliver minimally invasive curative treatment.

    The proposed project focuses on demonstrating the anti-migration properties of a temporary indwelling urethral device prototype. The device is designed to deliver a graft to a urethral graft bed, and hold it in place as the graft adheres over a period of 14 days without migrating. Proof-of-concept studies of the mechanically functional prototype will be performed on the bench and in vivo, to be further advanced by integrating proprietary anti-migration features. Key milestones include the prototype's ability to meet: targeted biocompatibility/cytotoxicity benchmarks, anti-migration benchmarks using an in vitro model, and an absence of significant migration in vivo over a 14-day period.

    \ develop a novel method for chemical analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance\
    \ (NMR) spectroscopy at moderate and low magnetic field strengths. A major cost\
    \ and physical limitation of NMR spectroscopy is the high-field magnet typically\
    \ required. Although high-field instruments face competition from smaller benchtop-sized\
    \ instruments, now a $120 million segment of the $1.25 billion NMR market, these\
    \ moderate-field devices have lower performance, high cost, and lack portability.\
    \ This project will address these challenges by exploring a new method designed\
    \ to work in weaker, different magnetic fields produced with cheap, light, portable\
    \ magnets. This will bring down the cost and expand the NMR market in a broader\
    \ range of applications in petroleum exploration, refining, and chemical manufacturing;\
    \ and potentially smaller educational institutions such as high schools. \n\n\
    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of the physical theory\
    \ behind a new form of NMR spectroscopy and its testing in moderate-field benchtop\
    \ spectrometers, as well as in low-field regimes where spectroscopic information\
    \ is currently impossible to acquire. This is made possible by a recently discovered\
    \ phenomenon called \"spin-lock induced crossing\" (SLIC), which measures how\
    \ the system responds to a small rotating magnetic field rather than a strong\
    \ static field. One goal will be to expand the theoretical understanding of SLIC\
    \ in order to predict and analyze the unconventional spectra it produces. Other\
    \ experimental tasks will include exploring the physical specifications necessary\
    \ for spectrometers to use the technique, evaluating the method's performance\
    \ compared to conventional NMR spectroscopy, creating a dictionary of low-field\
    \ spectra for common chemicals, and developing methods for automatic analysis\
    \ and interpretation of the spectra. The results will be used to develop software\
    \ for implementing the method on current benchtop instruments and will also provide\
    \ a basis for the design and translation of low-field spectrometers based solely\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve job-site safety of dry-stacking installation of masonry walls without binding mortar through the use of novel Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU). The AIMU multi-component wall system combines the advantages of wood and those of concrete and is potentially applicable for mid-rise multi-family housing, a key component of affordable housing stock in the US and worldwide.  These AIMUs can be laid quickly, safely, and accurately, reducing time and labor for cost-effective construction in the US and globally.  The proposed construction platform will improve durability and offer lower lifetime costs than standard wood-based wall construction.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will further develop a construction technology using masonry blocks via dry-stacking without binding mortar.  Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU) are made of cellular lightweight concrete (CLC) and an activated adhesion. The proposed work will conduct testing to confirm the AIMU's ability to fill incursions and block irregularities, evaluate interfacial shear resistance between the interlocking features, and evaluate the interfacial adhesion activated through pressure or moisture. These fundamental properties are critical to resolving the primary barriers for translation of dry-stack masonry construction technology. The project will also demonstrate rapid outdoor dry-stacking AIMU installation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the growth and processing parameters of a methane-reducing seaweed feed additive for ruminant livestock (i.e,. cattle). Globally, livestock methane emissions contribute up to 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%. The proposed project will advance this as a feed additive at scale by exploring three novel solutions for natural lighting optimization in land-based cultivation systems, profiling and integrating aquaculture wastewater (AWW) as a circular nutrient stream, and deploying an alternative processing method to the energy-intensive industry standard. These growth processes can likely be applied to algae production for other uses, such as food, while drying innovations are expected to be broadly applicable in tropical climates.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will build on work to grow Hawaiian Asparagopsis taxiformis in land-based systems and optimize for both yield and concentration of desired metabolites. Diurnal changes in solar position and irradiance, along with occlusion caused by algae self-shading, result in photosynthetic inefficiencies.  AWW contains large amounts of waste nitrogen and phosphorus; only 20-30% of nitrogen from the fish feed is retained in fish biomass. The integration of AWW will recover some of these nutrients and avoid downstream consequences of pollution, such as eutrophication. While drying material is important for the production of a shelf-stable product, existing technologies are either energy-intensive or perform poorly at retaining critical compounds in seaweed tissue. The project will test proposed solutions to this quandary, as well as contamination and strain development.

    The broader impact commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the accessibility of eye health care.  Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness but can be addressed with early detection, and the prevalence increases with age. However, existing tests can be tiring and difficult and require specialized equipment. This project will advance an inexpensive test for early detection for treatment.  This low-cost, tablet-based tool can offer universal, cost-effective glaucoma screening.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances novel retinal testing for glaucoma detection through improved modeling and data analysis of the visual system.  This project analyzes visual field test results to reveal a pair of linked cartographic maps that transmit central and peripheral retinal information to the brain through grouped retinal nerve fiber bundles segregated in a conformal mapping. A cone of photons displays the visual field information on the central S2 spherical non-Euclidean Riemann surface centered around the foveal axis, which lacks representation in the brain and can be considered as a singularity or reference region for each eye. Information on the S2 surface is transmitted through bundles of retinal nerve fibers that are grouped to represent single surfaces, and modeled as though the eye is a S3 4-dimensional hypersphere, with the blind spot being a singularity region and serving as the reference point. The retinal nerve fiber bundles transmitting the information to the brain are passively reordered at the blind spot and bring about an inversion of the Y (Up-Down) axis. Information from both eyes enables parallax removal and leads to depth perception. Information from the peripheral retinal regions of each eye is crossed across the optic chiasma and provides spatial locations of objects during peripheral vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide U.S. hospitals with a tool to help accurately predict the expected severity of illness for COVID-19 infected patients at the time of initial diagnosis. A simple interface uses Artificial Intelligence-based predictive algorithms to help hospitals make informed and accurate decisions about which patients require specific care and treatment interventions. This enhanced process allows hospitals better and faster decision-making on patient care and treatments, redirecting hospital resources (including staff, hospital beds, ICU) for maximum effectiveness. In the longer term, the platform can be adapted to predict illnesses related to other infectious diseases, and also scaled for countries where availability of hospital infrastructure is limited.

    This Small Business Technology (STTR) Phase I project will develop a completely new category of medical diagnostic and prognostic tools via a novel approach that relies on analysis of a complex multi-variate signal, reflective of the patient’s entire salivary metabolome and proteome. Artificial intelligence tools will be used to see if signal clusters correlating with patient outcomes can be identified. This is a radical departure from traditional medical diagnostics which evaluate individual biomarkers for a clinical diagnosis. Such approaches are ill suited to the task of predicting future patient outcomes. The scope of this pilot phase work is the development of an effective algorithm and understanding algorithm efficacy and reliability in prediction and classification of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The goals of the pilot project are to: (i) obtain COVID-19 patient bio-fluid samples, and (ii) develop machine learning techniques for an effective predictive algorithm. Multiple machine learning techniques and comparison strategies will be used for algorithm development and efficacy testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a new probe to detect low levels of viral load, such as that causing COVID-19.  Rapid and reliable kits are not currently readily available. This project will provide rapid detection of viral material using exsiting cost-effective techniques with fewer detection errors. Being able to quantify and track viral loads at low concentration and high accuracy will expedite tests, reduce false negatives, and accelerate vaccine and drug development to combat COVID-19, and future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop innovative fluorescent probes based on high-brightness fluorophores/dyes (HBFs) that offer tunable extinction coefficients up to several thousand times higher than commercial dyes. Based on this HBF platform technology, we will be able to create high-brightness qPCR probes that can specifically quantify viral RNAs by strong and tunable fluorescent signals at fewer amplification cycles and minimum replication errors. The activity, efficiency, and specificity of high-brightness qPCR probes will be evaluated in the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to digitize access to high-quality custom prosthetic and orthotic devices. This will increase convenience and reduce the cost of care for millions of people with limb loss or other disabilities. In 2018, the leading cause of amputations was complications from diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases, and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older. Despite progress in other aspects of prosthetic limb design, inefficiencies in the design and manufacture of the custom prosthetic socket still exist. The proposed technology uses a computational approach to digitize the biomechanical design required to develop high-quality, custom prosthetic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to digitize and automate customization of wearable devices that conform to the portion of a person’s limb remaining after an amputation. The function of this device (i.e. prosthetic socket) is to re-distribute pressure to areas of the person’s soft tissues that tolerate those pressures. This project will introduce new guidelines and processes for prosthetic socket design. The objectives include: (1) codify, modify, and implement existing design guidelines within a biomechanics engine to manage customizations for the individual user; and (2) implement a machine learning framework using training datasets of paired limbs and prosthetic sockets. The techniques developed by this work can be extended to other biomechanical processes with load/pressure transfer considerations beyond prosthetics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a system to improve pharmaceutical manufacturing and sepsis treatment. A toxic substance known as endotoxin is a common contaminant in many types of therapeutics, and it is the primary cause of batch rejection in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The economic impact of pharmaceutical batch failure due to contamination is high due to loss of product and facility closure for cleaning. The endotoxin removal market within drug manufacturing was valued at $315 million in 2018 and is expected to grow due to the increase in biopharmaceutical products. Additionally, endotoxins are dangerous when they enter patients’ bloodstream and can cause various medical complications, including sepsis.  The technology has the potential to remove endotoxins from patients’ bloodstream more effectively than current solutions  This project will develop a universal high-efficiency endotoxin removal filter that has the potential to not only improve drug manufacturing but also provide a life-saving treatment for sepsis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a high-affinity, high-specificity filter for endotoxin removal by using a protein that specifically binds endotoxin and has been shown to remove 99.9% of endotoxin from protein preparations. Traditionally, the use of proteins for product separations cause problems with durability and protein density, stability, and activity. These problems are overcome with unique materials that allow 100% incorporation of active proteins via a stable fusion with substantially increased protein stability. The binding capacity of the materials for endotoxin similar to current solutions (5,000,000 EU/mL) would be considered successful, although the binding capacity is expected to greatly exceed the current standard. Current solutions are compatible with only specific types of therapeutics. A prototype filter will be evaluated for endotoxin separation and protein recovery for three protein therapeutics. An 80% recovery of each therapeutic is expected, with simultaneous removal of 5,000,000 EU/mL of endotoxin. These tests will prove the technical feasibility of the prototype filter by showing the materials have a significantly higher binding capacity for endotoxin than current methods and that they are compatible with multiple types of therapeutics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance an improved system to sense and map  atmospheric conditions using nano-drones that are the size of small birds; these systems have benefited from recent innovations in miniature power electronics and flight control sensors.  The proposed project leverages the safety, cost and portability advantages of these small form factor aircraft in a system of coordinated drones flying in formation to measure wind, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations. Each flight of the swarm can cover hundreds of square miles, creating a high resolution 3D map of atmospheric properties. This enables the study of wind currents and gas movement for applications including detection of urban gas leaks, smog movement, and forest fire detection. Satellite measurements can be validated and improved through aerial measurements. This research will benefit public health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance new software to analyze and optimize nano-drones. This project will expand the understanding of miniaturized (under 100 g) drone performance and enable the development of advanced nano-drones to carry out valuable sensing missions. This project will: (1) validate an optimization framework with laboratory test data; (2) develop a novel, portable drone docking station allowing for easy launching, landing and charging of hundreds or thousands of drones by a single operator, eventually enabling fully automated use for continuous monitoring applications; and (3) develop visualization and analysis tools to facilitate data analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate feasibility of machine-learning (ML)-guided experimental campaigns that predict, assess, and optimize electroorganic transformations with small experimental datasets. Companies across the chemical industry have pinpointed electrochemistry as a promising avenue for the implementation of more sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. However, the large cost and effort required in new process development hinders the implementation of electrochemical technologies. ML predictive algorithms can be a powerful tool to accelerate the development and optimization of more sustainable chemical processes, but repeatedly require large amounts of experimental data to train the models. These large datasets are often unavailable and expensive to obtain, which significantly limits the use of ML in the chemical industry. The project will advance future manufacturing by enabling the development of new and more sustainable chemical production routes using 50% less experiments, ultimately unlocking the manufacture of new molecules, medicines, and materials in societal applications. Moreover, by reducing the number of experiments required, the technology will significantly lower emissions and resource consumption in the industry.

    The proposed project introduces a ML platform capable of guiding experimental campaigns and data collection to enable accurate predictions of reaction behavior with the smallest possible datasets. The approach relies on the combination of chemical engineering and ML knowledge to overcome the optimization limitations found within each field. It will be validated using the electrooxidation of p-methoxytoluene as a model reaction and will elucidate the fundamental limitations and strengths of ML predictive models capturing the complexity of physical systems with small datasets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate development of a digital infrastructure trust layer for public health data around monitoring and responding to COVID-19 public health objectives. This project will provide both trust and accessibility through the application of blockchain technology to public health data to transform it into verified, legally weighted, and tamper resistant data upon which decision makers in the public and private sector can benefit. This innovative combination of new technological solutions will allow for better products, data analytics, predictive modelling systems, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) responsiveness based on organized and trusted systems. Since public health statistics are used by private enterprise as well as the public sector and the general public, the addition of a trust layer to public health data more widely is important as fidelity in statistics is critical to effective individual and organizational action.

    This project’s goal is to develop tools and practices to make authoritative, reliable data available, enabled by cryptographic techniques and accessible to a broader set of individuals and organizations. The scope of the project looks to develop aggregation, access, and reporting systems which can support new decentralized economics, such as smart contract marketplaces, while remaining interoperable and accessible to users of legacy technology. The solution requires creation of a single, trustworthy platform that combines research, development and commercial application of emerging blockchain approaches with a suite of supporting technologies and systems including: distributed data infrastructure, flexible delivery methods, intuitive interfaces, and analytics tools. This research hopes to allow for the creation of novel resources to support the trustworthiness and consequently, the fundamental usefulness of all public health data records. The expected outcomes include: improved data integrity using blockchain-backed systems, tools enabling accelerated innovation in data driven decision making, and a prototype marketplace for COVID-19 resources managed by blockchain.

    \ because it is diagnosed at a much later stage when cancer has already metastasized.\
    \ One of the significant challenges associated with PC treatment is the standard\
    \ administration techniques (e.g., intravenous injection, oral administration)\
    \ cannot efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of the drug to the tumor\
    \ site because of the pancreas' anatomy. The innovative technology used in this\
    \ prototype device will render it as an implantable, biodegradable, drug-eluting\
    \ product allowing for spatio-temporal control and delivery of various active\
    \ pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly to the tumor site. Further, reductions\
    \ in global toxicity and access to traditionally unresectable areas may enable\
    \ higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents than could be tolerated by\
    \ systemic administration, significantly altering the treatment landscape. This\
    \ project will address the following four technical challenges related to the\
    \ formulation and physical characteristics of the prototype, which will determine\
    \ its release profile and the 3D printing mechanism, and its impact on the device's\
    \ quality. The research and development routes that are being pursued include\
    \ (1) assessment of prototype mechanical profile, starting with one API of interest\
    \ (2) assessment of different polymer compositions and how they impact the flow\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project improves outcomes following orthopedic ligament and tendon reconstruction. More than 1 million surgeries to repair torn ligaments and tendons are performed in the United States annually. However, the failure rates are reported to be as high as 25% and the majority of failures are attributed to a technical error, which costs the US healthcare system $2.5 billion each year. Stitching has been identified as a critical, technically complex step in the surgery that, if improved, can be a way to reduce the incidence of failure. Current stitching needles have serious limitations that make stitching slow, tedious, and inaccurate. The two-part needle technology proposed in this project fundamentally changes how stitching can be performed. Better quality and faster stitching provides a societal benefit of improved patient outcomes as well as commercial benefits of avoided costs associated with failed surgeries and savings from reduced procedure times.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports development of a revolutionary suturing device that will advance stitching capabilities for orthopedic ligament and tendon repair surgery. The groundbreaking two-part needle design offers a value proposition of improved speed and quality of stitching, two essential elements for clinical success. This project has two overarching technical objectives: First, prototypes will be constructed with variable characteristics, and force testing will be performed to determine how each characteristic impacts functionality of the device. Performance of the device with regards to forces experienced during stitching will be compared to conventional needles. Second, prototypes will be constructed and tested by potential customers to assess usability for the intended purpose of creating specific stitch patterns. Speed of stitching and biomechanical strength of the stitch patterns will be compared to patterns created with conventional needles to quantify the value proposition. Successful completion of the objectives will substantially advance the two-part needle technology toward commercialization in orthopedics and provide a basis for additional research of the two-part needle design for other surgical applications that rely on stitching.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve health care outcomes associated with complex procedures.  Approximately 1 in 7 major surgical procedures in the US is associated with a medical complication, totaling more than 4 million complications and $80 billion in costs per year. Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.  A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is inconsistently structured and not optimized to directly improve patient outcomes. The large datasets for most procedures provide only high-level conclusions regarding risk; they do not pinpoint the specific steps in provider workflow with high risk or the role of external factors, such as comorbidities or facility age. This project will determine the feasibility of using machine learning supervised by experienced clinicians to assess risk using principles from Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. The project will develop a proof-of-concept machine-learning system that uses a proprietary risk taxonomy and modifiers to combine national, state, facility, and actuarial datasets to generate risk priority numbers for each step for a service line. This system will then be applied to coronary artery bypass graft surgery to assess its validity and clinical value. Monte Carlo simulations and clinician focus groups using a Likert scale will determine the significance of the results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an engineered probiotic as an treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. Acute gout episodes cause debilitating pain and hypersensitivity, seriously impairing mobility. Over time, joint damage and deformity, chronic usage-related pain, and disfigurement follow. Although gout can be treated by drugs that lower uric acid levels, these drugs have significant drawbacks for many patients: they have limited effectiveness, are associated with serious side effects, and may be expensive. Gout patients experience an estimated increase of 5 absence days annually with an incremental cost of $3,000 per patient. The 9.2 million gout patients in the USA spend more than $1.3 billion per year on gout drugs. Moreover, roughly half take additional supplements. The proposed project will develop a novel probiotic strain to address hyperuricemia.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance hyperuricemia treatment using an engineered probiotic. The proposed treatment is based on the observation that enzymatically degrading uric acid in the intestine reduces serum uric acid levels, unlike conventional treatments targeting the circulatory system, the urinary tract, or function systemically. This project will use genetic screening to identify a probiotic strain to break down uric acid, engineering it to prevent gene mobility across species and avoid transfer of antibiotic resistance to the intestinal microbiome. Finally, we will confirm safety and efficacy in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to proactively manage eye health. Approximately 285 million people and 39 million people suffer respectively from visual impairment and blindness. Monitoring of eye disease in early stages is critical to slowing its progression, but currently this assessment requires specialized equipment in ophthalmology practices or optometry offices.  Smartphone-based disease detection is customizable, portable, easy-to-access, and multi-functional.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to design and develop an eye disease diagnostic tool using a smartphone. This project will develop and validate novel data acquisition, image processing and machine learning techniques for keratoconus, glaucoma, and cataract detection, including new algorithms for detection of motion and noise artifacts to reduce image corruption.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide waste concrete as a new raw material source for the glass and other industries.  It is estimated that 2.2 billion tons of waste concrete is generated globally each year.  About 70% of the construction waste generated in the US is concrete, but it is not typically used as a raw material for glass production or other chemical processes.  Using concrete as a raw material reduces its contribution to landfills as well as the need for mining virgin raw materials., and contributes environmental benefits.  This STTR Phase I project will study processes to prepare furnace-ready concrete for glass production.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the feasibility of waste concrete as a raw material constituent (feedstock) for calcium-silicate glass and glass-making.  Environmental benefits are possible because concrete contains the same key oxides used in glass making (silicon, calcium, aluminum and iron oxides) as well as sulfur compounds (e.g. gypsum mixed with the cement to regulate setting, and therefore can potentially serve as a candidate raw material in the production of calcium-silicate soda lime and calcium-borosilicate glasses.Research objectives include: 1) characterize variations in chemical composition from industrially relevant sources; 2) determine variation in contaminant concentrations; 3) demonstrate processes and methods to address contaminant variations' 4) characterize the specifications for a furnace-ready waste concrete glass batch; 5) produce pilot batches of calcium-silicate soda lime glass; and 6) characterize variations in produced glasses.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the lab-on-a-chip and other related life science platforms by the introduction of a new standardized microfluidic chip interface. The proposed project advances a novel interface to advance the applications and capabilities of microfluidic chips in both medical and non-medical fields, including dramatically increasing the rate at which doctors and medical researchers can prepare and perform diagnostic tests. The interface enables easy interoperability of devices as the chips can be freely switched out while the result of the hardware remains the same. The success of this project could lead to great breakthroughs in bioenergy, medical diagnostics, and drug therapeutics.

    The proposed project undertakes the development of chip interfaces with reduced size and increased channel density by making use of novel interfacing and sealing methods, on a reusable micro-patterned surface. While the technology exists to fabricate microfluidic chips with much smaller dimensions, with more complex on-chip operations, and at a reduced cost, the current limitation is the size of the interfaces bridging the microscopic world of the fluid microchip with the macroscopic world of the laboratory. The work proposed herein could enable chips with 16x the density of sample channels, allowing for vastly more complex diagnostics to be performed and thereby vastly reducing the sample volume needed for accurate diagnostics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to combat online trade in counterfeit and illicit goods. The project will integrate the results of a decade of academic research on anonymous online ("dark net") marketplaces and modeling of counterfeit pharmaceutical online sales with novel monitoring solutions for traditional e-commerce marketplaces. It will allow for the development and validation through pilot customer tests of an integrated platform for automated continuous data collection and analysis of the major players in the counterfeit and illicit goods online business. Through automation, the proposed technology should considerably reduce costs to brand protection managers (and law enforcement), allowing them to use their limited resources more effectively. This work should also help address some pressing economic and public health issues linked to the proliferation of counterfeits, such as counterfeit drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate automation of many manual online counterfeiting monitoring activities. The project will also show that intuitive visual interfaces can help customers (law enforcement agencies, brand protection managers) have immediate access to higher-level objects more useful for investigative purposes. These higher-level objects include metrics on the amount of sales conducted by a specific entity, deduplication between vendors, or inventory clustering. To do so, the project will further develop automated classification and analysis using techniques that were prototyped in the research lab, scale these techniques up to a production environment to further minimize human intervention, and combine these techniques with novel algorithms developed for slightly different application cases (traditional e-commerce marketplaces).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the success rates of cancer therapy, reduce the costs and duration of treatment, and to improve patients’ life quality. More than 70% of the 16 million Americans diagnosed with cancer will undergo ineffective chemotherapy cycles through trial-and-error methods. On average, a cycle of chemotherapy costs $30 k and takes 12 weeks to complete; cancer patients undergo 5-6 cycles at a cost of an estimated $180 k. This project advances a method to pre-screen response to chemotherapy drugs so that clinicians can select the most effective treatment, consequently shortening the duration, reducing complications, improving outcomes, and reducing the financial burden. The technology uses a quick, single-step, scalable, inexpensive, and automated process that tests a wide range of drugs in less than a week. With this technology, the oncologist will be able to select the most effective chemotherapy drug for a cancer patient, on an individualized basis and prior to initiating treatment. The proposed personalized approach would reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles to 1-2, and save up to $120 k per treatment, generating annual national savings of $18.2 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development, proof-of-concept validation, and preclinical evaluation of an automated biochip platform that grows patients’ cancer cells outside the body to screen them against chemotherapeutic drugs. In the research described herein, tumor specimens from patient biopsies will be grown and maintained as microtumors in the biochips to recapitulate clinical tumor behavior. The biochips and process will be optimized to create microtumors that can be used toward evaluating the performance of cancer treatment. Research objectives are to I) evaluate, refine, and optimize the design of the biochips through simulation studies to ensure compatibility with native tumor microstructure and mass transfer behavior; II) evaluate the formation, growth, and behavior of patient-derived microtumors in the biochips; and III) investigate the response of patient-derived microtumors to anti-cancer drugs in comparison to longitudinal clinical data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable the efficient emulation on classical computers of simulations carried out on quantum computing hardware. The proposed emulator technology is expected to address problems an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present using classical computing hardware. The emulator will be specifically designed for electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials. The successful completion of this project will disrupt the research and development associated with the use of quantum computing in the pharmaceutical and materials spaces by enabling faster assessment and development of quantum algorithms. Since it is widely accepted that these are impactful early applications of emerging quantum computing platforms, there is a paramount need for creating a user- and developer-friendly software stack specifically tailored for such simulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a quantum emulator on the basis of the so-called matrix-product-state (MPS) representation of fermionic wave functions. The innovation results from the fact that the proposed emulator will be specifically designed for fermions and therefore can take advantage of the physical symmetries inherent in these systems. The first-principles MPS wavefunction ansatz has been developed in the quantum chemistry community in the context of the ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) over the past two decades, and will be generalized such that the same APIs as used for the standard quantum emulator will be exposed to users. The proposed new software is expected to allow for emulation of quantum simulations involving 100 spin orbitals/50 electrons, or more, on commodity classical computing hardware, which is an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present. In this SBIR Phase I project, a Python prototype and associated command-line tools will be completed to demonstrate the technology and commercial viability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project isto improve the outcomes for implant procedures for soft tissue healing. More than 2 million musculoskeletal repair surgeries are performed in the U.S. each year, representing a $5 B market. Instead of conventional 3D printing that completely melts or fuses synthetic biopolymers into solid and rigid objects, this project will develop a novel 3D microfiber printing process project to rapidly and economically produce clinical-grade printed implants with better performance.  This technology will offer a significant reduction in the cost of goods and a faster product development cycle. The novel implants will be available in markets wherein existing products are prohibitively expensive, including ambulatory surgical centers, wherein most of these surgical procedures are performed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will progress the design and engineering for a novel 3D microfiber printer that can assemble clinically relevant synthetic biopolymer filaments into fibrous, flexible, high void/porosity implants to promote soft tissue healing. This approach offers improvements in quality, cost, speed, and manufacturability. This project will explore the material strength, cytocompatibility, and biocompatibility using industry-standard testing. Expected technical results include quantitative measures for a controlled fibrous 3D printing method compatible with diverse synthetic biopolymers and across clinical indications. This project will optimize the hardware engineering, polymer, and print configuration.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project improves treatment of viral conditions, starting with influenza. Each year seasonal influenza infects 9–35 million individuals, causes 56,000 deaths in the U.S., and costs $87.1 billion.  The proposed technology has the potential to produce more rapid protection, expand pathogen/variant coverage, and extend the longevity of protection afforded by influenza vaccination and other vaccines. This added protection will reduce the high healthcare costs and productivity losses due to mortality/morbidity. This technology has the potential to serve as a rapidly deployable prophylactic or vaccine adjuvant to enhance protection and reduce the necessary vaccine dose, expanding access and providing a timelier response.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a next-generation vaccine adjuvant platform. While vaccines represent a major medical success, several diseases have proven difficult to address, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. One way to improve the efficacy of vaccines for these diseases is to use an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response to the antigen presented via vaccination. The proposed technology has the potential to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of infections directly and via heterologous immunity because the addition of “Stimulator of Interferon Genes” (STING) agonist overproduction to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) serves a dual purpose: it enhances the elevated trained immunity of macrophages already known to be conferred by BCG and promotes critical antiviral IFN-I responses. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Optimize media and lyophilization for manufacturing of BCG-STING; 2) Evaluate the immunological effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 influenza vaccination; and 3) Assess the protective effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 vaccination. This will provide proof of concept for proceeding with the development of this novel recombinant BCG as an efficacy-boosting adjuvant that also offers intrinsic antiviral immunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a diagnostic product that addresses\
    \ patient safety and clinical decision-making for physicians managing patients\
    \ taking Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs). DOACs are becoming the preferred\
    \ drugs to reduce the risk of blood clots that can lead to significant adverse\
    \ events, such as stroke. However, DOACs are part of the leading class of drugs\
    \ implicated in adverse event-related emergency department visits. These adverse\
    \ events place a significant burden on the healthcare system in the form of transfusions,\
    \ exposure to blood products, platelet repletion, reversal therapies, and additional\
    \ complications (e.g. infection, sepsis, multiple organ failure) driving longer\
    \ hospitalizations, higher mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. In\
    \ emergency situations, the rapid detection of DOAC anticoagulation is needed\
    \ when planning for urgent care for surgery, serious trauma, drug overdose, emergency\
    \ procedures, or monitoring for drug accumulation in cases of renal and liver\
    \ failure.  This project proposes a diagnostic at the point of care. With an estimated\
    \ 21 M patients globally taking DOACs, this technology could significantly reduce\
    \ the $2.5 B in costs related to treating and correcting adverse events caused\
    \ by the absence of DOAC information in emergency care situations.  \n\nThis Small\
    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will demonstrate the feasibility\
    \ of a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic chip for emergency room clinicians to manage\
    \ bleeding risk and avoid overuse of drug reversal therapies, thereby improving\
    \ patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. Currently there is no approved\
    \ rapid diagnostic POC test that accurately identifies the type of DOAC drug a\
    \ patient is using, nor how much of the drug is in the patient’s blood. An integrated\
    \ microfluidic cartridge is proposed developed to manage blood distribution within\
    \ the device, mix the blood with DOAC detection reagents, and provide an integrated\
    \ assay result that evaluates the three important clotting factors in clot formation\
    \ (fibrin/thrombin/platelets). The technology is unique in that, unlike other\
    \ coagulation tests, it re-creates the blood clotting physiology, and characteristic\
    \ blood flow, that happens within the body. With DOAC-reversing drugs, the diagnostic\
    \ can determine DOAC type (Factor Xa or Factor IIa), and the level of DOAC in\
    \ the blood, allowing emergency room physicians to make more informed care decisions.\n\
