    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve patient outcomes through non-invasive\
    \ nasal drug delivery. The nasal cavity is a non-invasive drug delivery conduit\
    \ that is rapid-acting and inexpensive. Topical intranasal medications treat sinus-nasal,\
    \ neurologic, and systemic diseases. The proposed innovation will significantly\
    \ improve nasal drug delivery and patient outcomes by getting medication exactly\

    \ $12 billion/year. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I\
    \ project advances a new nasal drug delivery system.  Current topical drug deliveries\
    \ have limited effectiveness because they rely on distant particle atomization\
    \ through complex nasal anatomy. To overcome this, a self-administered, catheter-based\
    \ atomization drug delivery device that delivers drug directly to the anatomic\
    \ target will be developed. However, atomization only exists in larger, rigid\
    \ form factors. The objective of this research is to develop an novel atomizer\
    \ that maintains a small, flexible form factor to be incorporated into the catheter\
    \ tip. A new system like this is crucial for effective, tolerable nasal drug delivery.\

    \ Phase I project is to help restore grassland ecosystems and reduce net greenhouse\

    \ instinct of livestock. Grassland ecosystems have been shown to benefit from\
    \ large herds of animals that promote water absorption and replenish important\
    \ nutrients. However, most livestock in the western United States are currently\
    \ scattered in large pastures and allowed to roam individually.  This project\
    \ aims to develop and test low-cost ear tags which use audio and electrical stimulation\
    \ to reinforce the natural herd instinct of individual animals when they stray\
    \ from the group. High stock density/low duration grazing has demonstrated the\
    \ potential of reducing livestock greenhouse emissions and turning rangelands\
    \ into a net carbon sink. Higher vegetation diversity, more water absorption,\
    \ reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the expected ecological\
    \ benefits of this technology. This technology could also facilitate more efficient\
    \ and cost-effective ranch management. The risk of livestock theft will be reduced,\
    \ and the need for fences would decrease since the migratory instincts of livestock\
    \ work best on larger land areas. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will develop and\

    \ the additional innovation of a unique and low-cost strategy to use ear tags\

    \ from an accumulation of individual distance estimates. This technology will\
    \ use a highly integrated system using an ear tag attached to each animal in the\
    \ herd. Each tag will use a low power RF transceiver to periodically send brief\
    \ signals to the other tags in the herd. The tags will use signal strength measurements\
    \ to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will\
    \ then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity\
    \ to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag\
    \ will give an audio alert potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage\
    \ the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the proposed SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications) prototype, designed as a best-in-class pressure, temperature, and seismic sensor system to be incorporated into new global submarine fiber optic cable networks. The expected commercial impacts are significant, as the customer base for SMART technology includes commercial submarine cable suppliers, government monitoring agencies, scientific consortia and agencies, and internet content providers. The development and deployment of SMART will enhance scientific understanding of Earth’s oceans, seafloor, and subsurface via a fundamentally new approach to long-term subsea sensor network deployments. SMART will therefore provide essential new data to reduce disaster risk and improve global climate understanding, thereby reducing societal and environmental vulnerabilities to these long- and short-term threats.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop the first integrated SMART prototype system. This innovative real-time deep ocean monitoring technology will catalyze fundamental improvements in Tsunami Early Warning (TEW), Earthquake Early Warning (EEW), global climate monitoring and telecommunications resiliency.  The innovation is to tightly integrate sensors into the amplifiers (“repeaters”) used to boost signals in the optical fibers. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components will be utilized for nearly all physical elements of the system. The sensor assembly includes a 3-axis accelerometer, absolute pressure gauge, and temperature sensor, integrated with data acquisition circuits with suitable dynamic range and precision, a common communications module, an interface suitable for fiber optic cable spans up to 120 km in length, software and firmware necessary to support the data path, an isolated power source, and precision timing. The SMART repeater design is modular, allowing different sensors, adaptation to different repeater housings, or use as a standalone unit. Technical hurdles to be addressed include hardware development and integration, software development, data acquisition and processing, power management, communications bandwidth, and delivery of precision time and frequency references.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the enabling capabilities in applications that call for both in-air and underwater operations. The aerial-underwater drones are the first drones that can fly in air, swim in water, and transition swiftly between air and water. This project aims to equip the drones with video transmission capabilities through underwater acoustic communication so that the drone need not be tethered to operate underwater. With the enabling capabilities, the drone is useful in critical infrastructure mapping, coastal environment monitoring, emergency response, coastal surveillance, and search and rescue operations.  The underwater video transmission technology can also be applied to other platforms to extend underwater wireless and mobile internet.  The capability, in turn, has the potential to enable Internet of Underwater Things. The commercial potential of the project addresses the pain points of the existing products:  the low data rate and large form factor.  The enhanced drone will enable the hybrid vehicle to create a new market that is unserved by either Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design and prototype a small form factor acoustic communication system for aerial-underwater drones enabling them to achieve high data-rate video transmission over underwater wireless links. The intellectual merits of the proposed acoustic communication system include: 1) real-time hardware implementation of a novel MIMO (multiple-input-multiple-output) transmitter on an embedded GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) such that the system can be powered by battery and be fit in a small water-proof container, 2) real-time hardware implementation of a Turbo equalization receiver on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform to combat the huge Doppler spread and long multipath echoes of acoustic channels, 3) video transmission by a high information data rate of more than 300 kbps over underwater acoustic links, and 4) integration of the small form factor acoustic transmitter with the aerial-underwater drones without interfering with the operation of the drones.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable surgeons to see lymph nodes directly during cancer surgeries to (1) improve the quality-of-care for lung cancer, rectal cancer, and some gynecological cancers; and (2) save costs for hospitals by accelerating a time-consuming and potentially inaccurate step in cancer surgeries; (3) improve hospital accreditation performance, since lymph node number is a quality metric and many hospitals fail to meet the requirements stipulated by medical authorities. Decades of clinical evidence have shown evaluating lymph nodes is linked to higher survival rates for cancer patients. This project will develop a device to be seamlessly integrated into the existing surgical protocols and used as an accessory to existing laparoscopic towers and surgical robots. Any cancer hospital will be able to purchase this device, attach it to their existing towers or surgical robots, and improve their quality of care, surgery efficiency, and accreditation performance immediately at an affordable price.

    The proposed project addresses a difficult and common problem in surgical oncology – finding lymph nodes in cancer surgeries. Lymph nodes are critically important in the context of cancer because they are the channels for cancers to spread. However, lymph nodes are translucent in color and surrounded by fat, also translucent, making it difficult to find them with current optical systems. This project aims to develop a label-free optical imaging device to visualize lymph nodes with high contrast in real time without any injection. The goals of this project are to (1) build an accessory device attachable to a commercially available laparoscopic tower, (2) obtain optical performance testing results from animal carcasses, and (3) obtain optical performance testing results from cadaver specimens.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.

    The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will be a safe endovascular detoxification device for treatment of numerous acute and chronic pathologies. The proposed device could aid in the treatment of severe autoimmune disease patients and organ transplant patients, and furthermore, would clear up a path for safe use of viral gene therapy in the general population. It has the potential to decrease mortality and reduce the burden on the global healthcare expenditure for the widespread antibody-mediated pathological conditions. There is a societal need for a safe, cost-effective, fast-acting, widely-accessible, and easy-to-use system capable of rapid blood detoxification for treatment of pathological conditions. The markets targeted by the proposed device include the multibillion-dollar autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and viral gene therapy markets, with the largest market opportunity being the global autoimmune disease therapeutics market that is expected to reach $153.3 billion by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development an endovascular blood IgG detoxification platform for rapid elimination of IgG antibodies for treatment of IgG-driven pathological conditions.  Antibody-mediated immune response has been a key factor responsible for numerous acute and chronic pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejections, immune-mediated rejection in viral gene therapy. Currently, therapeutic apheresis and potent systemic immunosuppressives have been the main forms of management for IgG-driven pathologies. However, these forms of treatments are not patient-friendly, and in many cases do more harm than good. The proposed endovascular blood IgG detoxification device could potentially provide safe and rapid elimination of circulating IgGs, eliminating the need for unfavorable or in cases harmful treatments such as therapeutic apheresis or potent systemic immunosuppressives. The device will be comprehensively investigated in an ex vivo venous simulation system, testing its hemocompatibility, IgG-elimination capacity, and the influence of different parameters including rod material, rod diameter, rod length, flow rate, and therapeutic protein concentration. Furthermore, the safety, durability, immune response, and therapeutic efficacy of the device will be investigated in a lethal IgG-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) model in minipigs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project will address the provision of safe water to our global population.  In high income nations, high-quality drinking water is provided through centralized water-treatment/distribution systems.  For 2-3 billion people in lower income countries, clean drinking water is not a guarantee.  They must collect and store household water, often in open containers without disinfectant.  The consequences of these deficiencies include the consumption of unsafe water that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality from water-related diseases.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that one possible solution to this problem is to decentralize water treatment so that people treat their water right before they consume it in their homes (e.g. point-of-use water treatment).  However, designing point-of-use water treatment technologies is a challenging problem that requires the product to be technologically effective, simple to use, inexpensive, and socially acceptable.  This project will develop a disruptive technology for point-of-use water treatment and will meet these rigorous design criteria.  The technology has the potential to improve water quality, human health, and quality of life for millions of people around the world while employing US citizens for manufacturing and sales of the product.

    This project seeks to develop and test methods to apply metallic copper and an N-halamine coating to the surface of a porous ceramic tablet for household water purification in lower income countries.  The resulting tablet will effectively disinfect viruses, bacteria, and protozoa in 10-20 liters of stored household water for one year (over 7000 liters total) with a cost of less than 0.3 cents per liter.  Copper salt solution will be reduced through high-temperature heating to form microscopic clusters of metallic copper.  When added to water, the copper will oxidize to release copper ions into solution to cause pathogen disinfection. This component will be combined with an existing technology that releases silver ions from a porous ceramic tablet.  The synergistic effects of these disinfectants may enable 1-3-star certification from the World Health Organization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make it possible for astrophysicists to dramatically expand their ability to collect the spectra of distant galaxies, and so to advance their understanding of the universe. The most important factor in large-scale spectrographic data collection is the number of spectra taken per viewing hour. The planned Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) is mechanically simpler than the current state-of-the-art positioning systems; it will cost less to produce per installed fiber, and it will provide more fibers per unit area than any existing design. The spectra of galaxies is critical to dark energy and dark matter research programs, and these programs address the greatest open questions in astrophysics today. The relative simplicity of the DFPS mechanical components makes it a better choice for spectrographs of tens of thousands of fibers, but also for much smaller arrays of a few hundred fibers, such as could be installed on smaller telescopes. Thus, the DFPS will win a share of the small market for very large spectrographic instruments, but also to create for itself a large market for smaller spectrographic instruments.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a small Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 fibers on a 5-mm grid. Each fiber will provide a 3.6-mm x 3.6-mm range of motion and will be controlled by electronic circuits consuming less than 20 mW. A calibrated camera will view the illuminated fiber tips, monitoring their position with an accuracy of 10 µm, to measure and demonstrate the precision and repeatability of the fiber positioner. The stability of the positioner will be determined over the course an hour in warm and cold environments, and in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The direct method of fiber movement requires accurate control of voltages applied to many fibers in parallel, which is a challenging electrical engineering problem that has been avoided by other, mechanically complex systems. If we can locate fibers with an accuracy of 10 µm in the focal plane of a telescope, we will be able to provide a new and superior type of fiber-positioner, one that will be more compact, less vulnerable to mechanical failure, less susceptible to corrosion, and more resistant to fatigue than any other existing fiber-positioning system.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide near-real time information of changes in the spatial extent (flood mapping) and flow of rivers (water resource management) to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Effective management of water resources and associated risks has become a major challenge for society. Floods are common disasters around the world and droughts lead to major disruptions to economies and a loss of life. This project will leverage artificial intelligence, and peta-bytes of satellite imagery to implement a physics guided data-intensive approach for advancing global hydrological modeling. The project will provide efficient and accurate imagery-derived observations of water dynamics in rivers at relatively low computational cost (compared with ground sensors) in a user-friendly web environment. This will be a significant step towards improving the modelling and forecasting of water resources around the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop advanced artificial intelligence techniques to track surface water changes in rivers across the globe using vast amounts of satellite imagery. While conventional artificial intelligence techniques are purely driven by data, the proposed technology incorporates known physical laws into these algorithms. This physics guided approach makes these techniques much more robust to atmospheric disturbances (clouds, shadows, haze, etc.), and enables synergistic use of imagery datasets at different resolutions which are two major issues with satellite imagery analysis. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty quantification techniques will enable domain experts to incorporate their local knowledge about river flows into the framework to refine results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a new manufacturing process for on-chip lasers for silicon photonics using printed nanomaterial inks. The difficulty of a scalable method for fabricating on-chip, multi-color lasers is a major challenge for the silicon photonics market. Specifically, today's standard manufacturing of photonic chips does not include on-chip lasers. Without integration of laser engines to drive the circuits, the market potential of light chips is constrained by design and price. The technology developed here can allow foundries to mass produce chips with lasers and open multiple new markets for silicon photonics including wearable photonic sensors, optical data transfer, autonomous vehicle light detection and ranging, quantum information, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and healthcare applications such as immunoassay tests and medical imaging.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops on-chip embedded lasers to enable fully functional silicon photonic chip manufacturing. Currently, the laser solutions being employed in silicon photonics include bonded lasers and heterogeneous integration. The system integrators that assemble silicon photonics modules rely on often cumbersome methods of gluing individual lasers to silicon chips, keeping costs high and throughput well below desired levels. The photonic inks developed here will overcome this challenge by enabling an in-foundry laser solution via wafer-scale additive manufacturing. The photonic ink emits broad-spectrum light covering the visible to the near-infrared range and can be tailored to emit at specific wavelength bands relevant to different markets by altering the number of atomic layers. The goals of this Phase I project are to demonstrate electroluminescence from a p-n junction made from doped, few-layer nanomaterials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the identification of treatments for vascular leak disorders. Uncontrolled vascular leak disorders are common pathological processes that lead to tissue damage across multiple organs and over 60 clinical conditions. Currently, there are no drug-based therapies that address vascular leaks. Available solutions are focused on providing supportive care or decreasing inflammation, without addressing the underlying mechanism. This project is proposing a new approach to repair vascular leaks as a therapeutic intervention. By establishing the first drug discovery workflow for the identification of small molecules that repair vascular leakage, this project will enable the development of a pipeline of drugs for multiple conditions. The first condition targeted will be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which accounts for 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is the leading cause of mortality in ICU. Globally, it affects more than 3 million patients yearly. The proposed solution will decrease the number of deaths and the costs for ICU.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new structure-based drug screening platform designed to identify small molecules that activate the molecular pathways responsible for repairing vascular leakage. The proposed platform consists of a unique combination of novel machine learning methods for ligand-binding site prediction, fast docking algorithm capable of screening ultra-large (over a billion molecule) compound libraries with targeted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profile within minutes (5,000 compounds/second). The AI-guided docking approach is combined with in vitro high-throughput assays measuring the mechanisms of vascular leak in a physiologically relevant microenvironment of human tissues to select candidates targeting vascular leak disorders. In this project, the steps of this tiered workflow will be validated and applied to the first target, leading to the identification of a set of new drug candidates.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing safe, cost-effective elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater in order to protect human health and the environment while reducing the cost and complexity of remediation. PFAS are some of the world’s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS pose a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. PFAS in groundwater cannot be broken down through traditional chemical processes; Hence, current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream where the efficacy and safety of disposal are still uncertain.  This project focuses on the development of a low cost, sustainable treatment method that eliminates PFAS with no secondary waste generation and no costly consumables.  This technology removes the liability and environmental and health risks associated with incomplete elimination and secondary waste disposal.

    The objective of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to develop a safe, chemical-free and low cost PFAS electrolyzer for groundwater remediation. The electrolyzer consists of a divided radial-field unit cell architecture with a de-polarized cathode and a high surface area and low-cost anode electrocatalyst material. The electrocatalyst is designed to provide direct oxidation at high voltage and the treatment process will mineralize PFAS in a single step, in minutes, with no breakdown byproducts or secondary waste. A scalable, single unit cell bench-top electrolyzer will be designed and built for treatability testing of PFAS-contaminated groundwater.  The anode electrocatalyst material composition will be optimized and coated onto high surface area substrates.  A de-polarized cathode will be developed to eliminate the catholyte loop and hydrogen generation, and lower energy consumption. The PFAS mineralization effectiveness will be measured as a function of operating parameters and water quality.  The electrocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism of the new anode material will be determined. Using the experimental results, the capital and operating cost of a groundwater remediation system will be estimated.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the development of an economically viable process that can help mitigate and reverse climate change by pulling carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and using it to make durable polymers used in items that surround us every day. There is increasing global pressure to end emissions-intensive, fossil fuel-based operations. However, society has a extensive infrastructure that uses hydrocarbon as fuels as well as in plastics and other polymers. The proposed system will be used to manufacture useful hydrocarbon materials using carbon dioxide captured from air and hydrogen split from water. This technology represents a new pathway for meeting global demand for hydrocarbons without relying on fossil fuels, which may result not only in reduced emissions but in a net draw-down of the “legacy CO2” in the atmosphere. This technology may create new jobs in the American economy, mostly outside the urban commercial centers.

    This SBIR project will develop a novel system that integrates CO2 direct air capture into a water electrolysis device so as to produce a stream of captured CO2 and green hydrogen (H2) from a single device with energy requirements not much higher than water electrolysis alone. The system relies on two primary innovations: 1) a water electrolysis process using a unique buffer solution and a novel reactor design that combines direct air contact with water electrolysis to simultaneously capture CO2 and produce H2 from water, and 2) a new hollow fiber membrane bioreactor that uses multiple layers of hydrogel-encapsulated organisms to convert the electrolysis reactor’s emissions into biogenic methane (also known as renewable natural gas or RNG), and eventually into more complex hydrocarbon molecules. The goal of this project is to optimize the performance of both the electrolysis reactor and the bioreactor in order to demonstrate an economically viable pathway for capturing ambient CO2 and “upcycling” it into RNG. While the initial upcycling target is RNG, the emissions from the electrolysis reactor are suitable for conversion into more complex hydrocarbons.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to secure Integrated Circuit (IC) Intellectual Property (IP) against untrusted parties in the globalized IC supply chain.  Outsourcing of IC foundries creates risks of IC reverse engineering, overproduction, theft, and even piracy. A promising method of achieving hardware IP security is by logically locking the functionality of a design by replacing a subset of the design components with programmable elements. The correct content of these elements forms the key for unlocking/activation of the design in a secure facility and/or via a secure protocol after manufacturing. A technical challenge in commercializing this technology is the long time period typically needed to assess the security of a locked design against state-of-the-art attack algorithms at the design phase. This project will address this technical challenge by developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted design security analyzer tool to instantaneously provide an accurate attack runtime estimation on a locked design, significantly reducing the design time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly shorten the time required to assess attack resiliency of an obfuscated (locked) Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Running the state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability solvers (SAT attack) on a state-of-the-art computer server to de-obfuscate a locked design can take time - ranging from days to months. Such a long security analysis time is prohibitive for deployment in the design process where iterative design optimizations are needed for making power, performance, area, and security (PPAS) trade-offs. This project aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel approach that will bring the security assessment time down to near zero using a machine-learning based model. Based on recent advancements in graph and geometric deep learning techniques, an innovative end-to-end security assessment framework is proposed that directly and losslessly ingests the original design as a graph-structured input, and then automatically learns the discriminative features that influence logic locking security. To support sufficient data for the proposed data-driven method, a logic locking macro-database will be developed that encompasses the required PPAS, attack and defense information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance exploration and commercial development of the Moon and, eventually, solar system, by lowering the risk of damage to surface and orbital infrastructure from ejected lunar dust during rocket landings and launches. This activity is in the area of material processing/manufacturing in space, and focuses on the space infrastructure (civil works) market sector, similar to roads and airports on Earth. Creating a viable, cost-effective solution to mitigate lunar dust will lower the cost of accessing the lunar surface and accelerate the development of lunar surface infrastructure that is necessary for all aspects of sustainable commercial space development, including mining, manufacturing, construction, habitation, power generation, communications, and in particular, transportation. Facilitating lunar exploration will expand scientific knowledge of the solar system.  It will also enhance commercial development that will expand economic opportunities by opening new areas of the economy in space, with inevitable spin-off benefits for life on Earth. In the long term, the capacity to create new areas for habitation on the Moon and throughout the solar system will have profound impacts on human society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes building lunar landing pads to address the problem of surface dust ejected during rocket landings and launches, which can otherwise damage both nearby and distant infrastructure, including those structures located the other side of the Moon and in orbit. To minimize transport costs from Earth, surface infrastructure must be constructed from local materials as much as possible. Instead of using high-energy processes to harden regolith, this approach will bind it with a high-performance polymer created from lunar volatiles co-located with water-ice in polar regions. This solution reduces mass, cost, and technical risk by leveraging anticipated water-ice mining operations and utilizing discarded volatiles from their operations to produce high-quality polymers.  The approach may be sustainable, producing enough material annually to replace worn-out sections of landing pads. Phase I will focus on converting raw volatiles into polymer precursors, fabricating/testing candidate composite materials, and elaborating the concept of operations, through a combination of research, modeling, and laboratory experiments. Information gathered during Phase I will narrow the range of candidate polymers for further consideration, identifying chemical synthesis pathways for more extensive development, and highlighting areas of improvement to maximize commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project stems from developing a wireless communications technology based on physical (PHY) layer rateless codes.  If successfully demonstrated, these codes could provide high data rates with low computational costs, minimum latency, and enhanced energy efficiency, i.e., long battery life. The initial target of the technological innovation is the space communications market - both commercial and government space programs. Space communication systems are a critical and integral part of every space mission. This Phase I project focuses on an enabling technology addressing capability gaps that could provide cheaper and faster solutions for the data communication systems. Commercialization of the proposed technology is beneficial to the US economy and government since the development of innovative technologies for the space sector contributes to economic growth in the emerging space economy. The proposed next-generation wireless communications technology may also support a wide variety of applications and use cases in the terrestrial wireless market. These application areas include 5G Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a PHY rateless codes-based novel adaptive transmission technology for the reliable transmission of information bits between a wireless transmitter and receiver. PHY rateless codes have the innate ability to adapt both the code construction and the number of code bits for an as-needed transmission of code bits. The adaptive transmission technology in the PHY layer interacts with the automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols in the data link layer (DLL) affecting its sequence of operations. The DLL designed for the traditional fixed-rate coding is a poor match for the PHY rateless system. A key goal of the proposed Phase I project is to design a simple and yet effective DLL for a proximity space link using PHY rateless codes which optimizes the throughput, establishing the technical feasibility. The Phase I project aims to add new design features to the PHY rateless encoder and decoder based on deep learning/auto encoder enhancements, structured permutations, and efficient algorithms/techniques for solving sparse linear systems.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate and improve the development and optimization of enzyme products.  This project will develop a platform that reduces costs and delays associated with research.  These enzyme products will improve the cost, safety, and sustainability in a range of applications, such as biomass processing, animal nutrition, solid and liquid waste management, household and industrial cleaners, and enzyme replacement therapies.  This solution will support the growth of the $10 billion enzyme market.

    The proposed project will advance a fluorescence-based enzyme activity-sensing platform, by reducing barriers to development of new industrial biocatalysts, enabling the rapid design of hydrolytic enzymes for industrial and specialty markets through the development of modular enzyme activity probes. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research and development are (1) determining performance metrics (limits of detection, speed, accuracy) relative to existing characterization techniques, (2) determining effects of sensor preparation methods on sensor performance, and (3) developing a robust reader for field use. The goals of the proposed research and development are to (1) provide parity data to current assays for end-users to engender confidence in our approach, (2) standardize production protocol, and (3) provide hand-held reader that is inexpensive (<$3000) and can withstand rough handling in field. At a high level, these goals will be achieved by (1) testing our sensors on a panel of candidate enzymes that have rigorous characterization already (to establish performance metrics), (2) using designed experiments to screen process space of sensor preparation and model effect on sensor performance attributes, and (3) using a design-build-test engineering framework to test reader components and layout.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines, scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.  This project advances a peptide production system.

    The proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure, novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and purification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved sustainable food production. Mycotoxins are common contaminants found in cereal grains that can track through feed production and ultimately poison livestock animals. These poisoning events manifest as waste and inefficiency within human food supply chains. Animals consuming contaminated feed grow more slowly, produce less milk/eggs, are more susceptible to disease, etc. This equates to lost profits for the famers, lost meals for the consumer, and concerns over long-term food security. This SBIR Phase I project addresses this challenge through detection of these toxins. This technique offers a potentially transformative new tool in the field of point-of-source diagnostics, while simultaneously addressing the needs of the industry. This toxin detection system will be faster, simpler, and more versatile.

    The proposed project advances a new generation of mycotoxin detection technologies. This technique employs novel compounds designed to associate with a specific mycotoxin of interest to enable reliable quantitative detection. These detector compounds operate by changing the spectroscopic properties of the toxin, such that it can be detected even in complex biological mixtures like animal feed. The project investigates the extraction buffer composition and the detector compound design. The buffer and detector compound combinations will be optimized by characterizing the spectroscopic signatures under different excitation conditions.  This research program will target the two key classes of mycotoxins most relevant to industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.

    The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve drone control. Current controllers are effective in specific environments but perform poorly in environments and flight conditions such as turbulence, thereby narrowing the scope in which drones can be used.  This project will advance a plug-and-play solution in which users can focus on higher-level tasks specific to their use case, like obstacle avoidance and route planning. This new controller has broad applications in both commercial and military settings: it enables stable flight across a wide array of environments, expands the flight envelope in turbulent conditions, and allows for longer missions due to increased control efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of drone control in turbulence through the development of a reinforcement learning-based flight controller. The project will enlarge the design envelope for quadcopters as well as provide a system and environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to other control problems. Contemporary systems rely on Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controllers as an essential part of stable flight. These PID controllers rely on holistically tuned, static functions to convert maneuvering commands into voltage changes across drone motors to meet the rotor’s targeted rotation speed. In lieu of statically defined PID equations, this novel controller uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a subset of machine learning where an agent is trained to select actions that maximize a reward across an environment. This technique has led to greater-than-human performance across a variety of different control and game theory tasks, but little is known about how these techniques fare when replacing PID control systems. The primary advantage the development of a reinforcement learning controller would have over simpler PID controllers is the ability for the user to view drone control at a higher level of abstraction, thus mitigating the need to focus on the minutiae of flight control for complex missions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of a patient-friendly and cost-effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection arising from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The inability to quickly stop the spread of respiratory infectious pathogens can have devastating global consequences, resulting in millions of deaths and creating an enormous economic burden. This project will prove the viability of an aerosolized pan-coronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. An inhalable therapeutic has a stronger commercial potential than the currently approved monoclonal antibodies which require intravenous delivery, and this drug will be more likely to retain potency against future variants. The COVID-19 virus is expected to persist in the human population, and novel variants thereof will continue to emerge. Therefore, this technology could be crucial in addressing these ongoing medical needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of an inhalable decoy receptor that would effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its endogenous cellular target and thus prevent infection of the host. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. The decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface. Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lower the geohazard risks for assets within critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and utilities. More specifically, the proposed technology will make measuring and detecting ground motion with satellite radar more practical in applications where the observed areas cover very long distances and traverse varying terrain and land types. The innovation seeks to demonstrate that the combined processing of multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations can improve the information collected and that the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data can be used to aid insight. The efficacy of space-based satellite radar interferometry in measuring shifts in spatially-sensitive structures such as buried pipelines, foundations, and rail track ballast will be demonstrated over very large areas and linear distances. The technology developed in this project may have a positive impact on the aforementioned sectors by enabling monitoring capabilities that are timelier and more cost-effective than traditional approaches. The geospatial technology may also enable asset operators to be more proactive when it comes to geohazard threats, lowering the frequency of fatal and environmentally-damaging failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the key shortcomings of space-based satellite radar interferometry as a means to monitor surface motion threats to critical infrastructure assets. While interferometric approaches for specific types of terrain have been well documented and validated, approaches that produce coherent ground motion results over very large areas with varying terrain and radar scattering mechanisms have not been successfully deployed. Furthermore, combining multiple interferometric observations together to decompose ground motion has received little research attention despite being an important step in translating the relative line-of-sight satellite observations into ground motion components relevant to asset monitoring. This research effort seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of using multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations and combining their interferometric results to create a more continuous view of ground motion over areas with varying degrees of vegetation. This project may also demonstrate that combining both small baseline subset and persistent scatter interferometric approaches can improve the density of resolved scatterers over areas where land type variations create a diverse range of scattering mechanisms. The team also seeks to  demonstrate the use and accuracy of GNSS data in the reference setting process as insights are translated into absolute motion components about the geodetic reference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a low-cost, flexible, Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Label that is self-powered in all lighted conditions. This Smart Label can be directly attached to packages, shipments, buildings, or worn as a medical device, enabling real-time data with improved accuracy. Sensing labels and asset trackers are extensively used to control inventories and monitor the freshness, quality, safety, and shelf life of perishable goods, as well as pharmaceuticals, foods, healthcare samples, and more. Existing radiofrequency identification (RFID) smart labels have no energy storage or energy harvesting capability. Current asset trackers have rechargeable batteries, with some powered by silicon-based photovoltaics which have poor indoor light performance. This project integrates organic photovoltaics (OPV) into flexible smart labels for continuous power supply under indoor and outdoor light, allowing frequent transmission of data to the cloud. OPV technology will be uniquely tuned to the common indoor light spectra to deliver light-to-electricity performance values over 20%, twice the indoor light performance of the best commercially available silicon photovoltaics. This program will combine flexible OPV with flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) to create a low-cost, flexible, thin, light-weight, and credit-card-sized IoT device with onboard sensors and radios for continuous wireless communication.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a continuously-operating flexible IoT device for flexible IoT smart labels on packaging, asset tracking, and in retail. The current limitations to a completely flexible, OPV-powered IoT device are: (1) OPV has not been specifically tuned to the light emitting diode (LED) spectrum; (2) OPV has not been attached to FHE before; and (3) IoT-Smart-Label-integrated OPV has not existed in production before. Attaching the FHE to OPV is the most significant technical risk, so the goal of this project is to validate flexible OPV-powered IoT smart labels as a viable product, delivering three proof-of-concept prototypes. To achieve this primary goal, the objectives are divided into groups based on eight key elements: (1) develope OPV sheet for printed electronics integration, (2) demonstrate printed device circuits and antenna on the backside of OPV sheets, (3) determine ideal power management chip for conversion to flex-compatible form factor, (4) place and integrate silicon chips, (5) integrate and test the flexible batteries, (6) package/laminate the entire flex label, (7) demonstrate wireless data transfer from the flex IoT device to the cloud, and (8) develop roadmap for manufacturing scale-up in Phase II, including an estimate of scaled-up product cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to improve public health.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment (PPE), including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), have been critical to containing disease spread and protecting first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. Shortages of FFRs have led public health agencies to provide guidance in favor of FFR decontamination and re-use as a crisis capacity strategy. This project seeks to develop a cost-effective approach to support sterilization and re-use of personal protective equipment at the point-of-care. The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the high cost and poor safety of Lithium-ion batteries in new energy applications. Low-cost and safe batteries will improve economic viability for solar energy storage, which is critical to increasing renewables penetration to above 30% of total power generation. This project advances a battery material to provide lower cost, higher safety and improved cyclability compared to currently used materials. This can support new batteries in applications including electric vehicles, grid-tied and solar storage, and consumer power tools, among others.

    This SBIR project proposes a novel nanostructured LiMn2O4 cathode chemistry (ND-LMO) that offers ~30% lower $/kWh cost compared to incumbent nickel managanese cobalt oxides (NMC) materials. Furthermore, it will have iimproved performance parameters, such as cycle life, a safer heat generation profile, and a 10% greater amp-hour capacity between full state of charge and maximum depth of discharge. Many of these improvements stem from the “intercalation-pseudocapacitive” properties of finely nanostructured electrode materials. Technical challenges, such as inactive and deactivating surfaces, synthetic costs, and others, must be addressed for these systems to be commercially viable.  The project’s proposed composition and methods used can be applied to other material systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel artificial intelligence technology that enables U.S. corn farmers to optimize nitrogen fertilizer applications based on field characteristics, rainfall and growing conditions. More efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer will reduce the carbon footprint of U.S. agriculture because more than 10% of the energy consumed in the U.S. agricultural sector goes toward the production of nitrogen fertilizer for corn. Because nitrogen fertilizer is a critical driver of both input costs and yield, this technology will improve the profitability of U.S. farmers by reducing input costs and maximizing corn yields. This project may enable corn production that creates less nitrogen fertilizer pollution, which threatens human health, degrades aquatic ecosystems and emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. A key social element of this project is a teaching module for middle-school science students that will blend content on soil science, agronomy, and crop management with the challenges faced by U.S. corn farmers to follow best management practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using machine learning to evaluate the amount of yellowness on the lowest corn leaves visible in images taken from low-cost cameras mounted on ground robots. Characteristic yellowness on corn leaves is a strong indicator of stress caused by insufficient nitrogen, a key nutrient. A prototype neural network model will be iteratively improved, in part by dramatically increasing the available training imagery over the course of this Phase I project. Imagery will be collected on field trials set up across several Mid-Western states. Preliminary data suggest that the extent of characteristic yellowness is an indicator of accumulated nitrogen stress that is observable only under the canopy and not via airborne sensors. A commercially available nitrogen model will be used to estimate accumulated nitrogen stress across small plots created by manipulating the amount of added nitrogen fertilizer when corn is about 1-2 feet high. Tuning will occur by adjusting key model parameters through simulation until the differences are minimized between observed and modeled accumulated nitrogen stress across a field’s small plots. Parallel software development will improve prototype codes running simulations of a leading nitrogen model, enabling rapid model tuning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an easy-to-use virtual reality (VR) toolkit to enable rapid development and deployment of educational VR experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the “backward design” approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve shellfish production at scale and in an environmentally sustainable fashion, using oyster farming as a launching pad.  Today, most oysters are farmed nearshore under ecological stress.  This project advances the culturing of microalgae using internal waste streams and those from other food industries. The focus of this project is to process one of the most abundant, sustainable, and freely available industrial food wastes, spent yeast from breweries, to facilitate algae production at scale onshore and indoors. Although currently used primarily by the food and chemical industries, the less costly algal product could also energize areas of food and feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, biomaterials, and bioremediation services.

    The proposed project will advance the use of off-the-shelf bioreactors and a novel substrate which, along with CO2, form plant tissue heterotrophically in the dark as leaves do photosynthetically in the presence of sunlight. The proposed substrate enables production at scale of the single-celled microalgae that comprise much of the nearshore bivalve diet.  The yeast is fermented with both agriculture-grade vitamins and plant-based commodities.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve agricultural operations with respect to infection.  Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.

    The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal’s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal’s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable plastic recycling process. In the United States less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the remainder are incinerated (15%) or placed in landfills (75%). Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.  This project develops a low-temperature system for high quality, high-value plastic products in closed-loop recycling.

    The proposed project will apply synthetic biology and related biotechnologies to identify, engineer, and optimize new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.  These enzymes will enable closed-loop plastic recycling in an economically viable, low temperature, low CO2 emission process.   The first objective is to sample plastic contaminated environments for naturally occurring enzymes that have evolved to depolymerize PE and PET synthetic polymers.  Candidate PE and PET enzymes will be engineered to accelerate their ability to efficiently target and cut complex PE and PET polymers under scalable process conditions.  Millions of enzyme variants will be constructed, tested, and analyzed using synthetic biology, high-throughput screening, and machine learning technologies.  A primary goal of this effort is to demonstrate a 10-fold increase in PE and PET depolymerization rates compared to naturally occurring plastic degradation proteins.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable radiotherapies for metastatic cancer, estimated to account for 90% of the 600,000 cancer deaths in the US each year. Of the approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the US, nearly half are candidates for improved outcomes using some form of radiation-based therapy. Metastatic cancer, however, is generally not treated with radiotherapies due to the need for prior knowledge of the metastatic sites. The proposed project treats metastatic cancer by using the cancer cells themselves to help deliver the radiation. This technology may generate reliable efficacy of radiotherapy for the treatment of the most lethal forms of cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to advance radiotherapy that exploits cancer cells themselves as catalysts for therapeutic delivery. After systemic administration or local injection, the monomers are expected to diffuse through tissues and subsequently polymerize, immobilizing radionuclides in the extracellular space of cancer cells.  Non-cancerous cells will be minimally impacted, as soluble monomers will remain subject to diffusion and relatively rapid tissue clearance in the absence of cancer cell-derived catalysts. The chemistry at the core of the approach is an enzyme-triggered polymerization of native-like compounds under physiological conditions.  The final therapeutic compound features the polymerizable compound and covalently-conjugated radionuclide 131-I, a commonly used radiotherapy isotope.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves leveraging an innovative approach to deliver and monitor therapeutics more effectively. Real-time monitoring and tracking of immune and stem cell therapies is in its infancy. However, without the capability to precisely know where therapeutic cells localize, clinicians cannot assess safety, design optimal doses, or make clinical decisions related to therapeutic approaches. As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients. This proposal addresses a critical unmet need in the cell and gene therapy industry for rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic cells specifically to enable tracking in the body. The addressable market for preclinical and clinical cell tracking in clinical trials involving therapeutic cells in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $1.14 billion by 2024.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an innovative approach to intracellular delivery where mechanoporation or cell-squeezing is achieved simply by propelling cells, in the presence of exogeneous cargo, through a proprietary mechanoporation element that resides in a column designed to be processed in a centrifuge (spin column). End users will realize significant advantages over conventional and microfluidic approaches to intracellular delivery including: 1) Convenient spin column format; 2) Short cell processing times; 3) Ease of scale-up and multiplexing; 4) Applicability to numerous cell types; and 5) Compatibility with automated/robotic cell production systems including autologous cell production systems designed for clinical settings. Three objectives are proposed involving the generation of prototype spin columns and their use in optimizing aspects of element design to afford efficient intermolecular delivery of iron-based nanoparticles (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent) into T-cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells. The study will enable rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic and regenerative cells for in vivo tracking, empowering clinicians to make timely decisions with respect to treatment strategies, thus ensuring better clinical outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to revolutionize wildlife field work and research. Many wildlife professionals already understand the potential for using video as a sensor, but without commercial software to turn video into data, its vast benefits remain untapped. It is important to monitor environmental effects and the impact of urban growth; billions of dollars are spent annually understanding how construction and infrastructure projects are impacting species and habitats. The state of practice is to send technicians into the field for observation. In many situations using a camera system to monitoring for wildlife is not only safer and more effective, but also much less expensive that using human labor. This project will reduce the cost, decrease the timeline, and yield better outcomes for these important conservation efforts, allowing the existing biodiversity to be preserved.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a web-based software-as-a-service to detect, track, and classify wildlife from video and images captured in the field. There is substantial potential for video to provide better data to help wildlife biologists perform their work, but the main barrier is the complexity. Using video systems to study wildlife requires advanced multidisciplinary knowledge; appropriate camera technology, recording methods, advanced video processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.  There are currently no commercial-off-the-shelf hardware or software packages available for biologists. This project will reduce the complexity of obtaining quantitative data from video by developing commercial-off-the-shelf equipment packages, automated video processing software, and the advisory services needed to make this transformational technology more accessible to biologists in the field.  The video processing needed is the focus of the research; the goal is the create algorithms that automate object detection and classification from the video and allow non-experts to create an accurate machine learning classifier with minimal labeling requirements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several industries, the company’s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase.  The project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent flows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The software  will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows. The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions. The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy simulations of the vortical wake.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to mitigate healthcare costs and challenges associated with the nation's growing aging population. The outcome of this project will be a system that enables holistic, accurate, and faster monitoring of elderly people that will 1) improve quality of life and health of senior citizens, 2) address the future nursing shortage, particularly in the geriatric field, and 3) reduce healthcare costs. The proposed technology can impact a wide range of public health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health monitoring.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project applies real-time computer vision and sensor fusion processing for real-time continuous monitoring and analysis of health-related activities. In addition, this project takes an essential step beyond current solutions by analyzing seniors' group behavior and interactions with objects to determine whether they suffer from loneliness, behavioral disorders, or confusion states. This project utilizes multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize the discriminative power to understand human micro-body motions and thereby create a training framework for personalized behavioral understanding and monitoring. It also proposes an innovative solution to leverage the results of computer vision as attention feedback to thermal sensors to enhance the accuracy and robustness of thermal processing against temperature variations. Furthermore, the project offers an integrative edge-based Internet of Things solution to protect citizens' privacy while providing real-time continuous feedback to responsible personnel. The proposed system offers a novel user experience while protecting personally identifiable information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases, often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  An unbiased screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further enhanced binding to FcRn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to save water and energy across a wide spectrum of industrial and commercial applications (i.e. boilers, baking ovens, furnaces, proofers, HVAC systems) that emit wet exhaust into the environment. For example, the U.S. bread baking market segment alone may save over 50 million therms of energy and over 400 million gallons of water annually with the proposed technology.  The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon’s optimal performance at unconventional conditions. The non-linear phase-change heat transfer mechanisms will be defined and simulated, followed by a sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the channel geometry and thermosiphons array for subsequent prototype design and performance demonstration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make a new class of antibody-based immunotherapies that can be generally applicable to oncology patients. For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop strategies to mitigate occlusion of thoracic catheters (chest tubes). A study by the Cleveland Clinic determined that 36% of chest tubes were completely obstructed at one point, with 86% of these clots existing in the thoracic cavity, undetected by clinicians. The complications that result from occluded chest tubes can include postoperative atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade. The team will design, develop, and commercialize a novel chest tube to solve the high impact clinical need. This  novel chest tube seeks to reduce drainage-related complications following cardiothoracic surgery. The novel system proactively manages fluid flow within the inner lumen of a catheter in order to flush and drain the tube, reducing the incidence of blood clogging.

    The proposed activity seeks to develop a chest tube that proactively provides fluid flow in order to prevent blood clot formation associated with draining fluid and blood during cardiovascular surgery. The product introduces a novel approach called dilutional coagulopathy for addressing clotting issues, where sterile saline or anticoagulants is proactively used to reduce thrombosis in an enclosed drainage spaces, rather than rely on historical methods of chemical or mechanical barriers for reducing or hindering clot formation. The project aims to develop prototypes using biomaterials and fabrication methods suitable for eventual patient use, and undertake the risks of demonstrating proof of concept and reduced clotting in an animal model of post-surgical drainage complications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is develop an innovative medical technology for localized and sustained antibiotic treatment in the case of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The proposed activities may result in commercialization of an implant with novel reservoir technology to be placed at the infected site, and which will locally deliver antibiotics to eradicate the infection. This solution may improve patient care as well as reduce costs associated with treatment of infection. The development of an implantable, antibiotic-eluting orthopedic spacer which enables patients to return to ambulatory conditions while providing sustained, appropriate, anti-infection resistance for a sustained duration could benefit patients and reduce medical costs. The proposed product seeks to reduce infections and reduce the need for surgical revision and significant antibiotic treatments. If successful, this technology will reduce the burden associated with unresolved infections and avoid amputations.

    This team will design, develop, and validate the proof of concept for an orthopedic spacer. The system will be 3-D printed using a novel porous medium capable of controlled antibiotic elution.  The product will be tested using benchtop mechanical testing and in vitro studies of implanted system viability and controlled elution. The objectives include a study of the prototype's ability to meet design criteria for mechanical performance, as well as a demonstration of a superior antibiotic elution profile over an extended-release period. The mechanical testing to be performed include load, stress, and cycle testing within current standards, in conjunction with in vitro laboratory elution testing of the specified antibiotic substance over a sustained duration of time (up to >180 days).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative method to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). UGIB results in more than 550,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone with a mortality rate of up to 20%. The gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding market is projected to be nearly USD 1 billion by 2026, with the overall hemostatic agents market reaching over USD 5 billion. Current solutions require endoscopy performed by a specialist or hospital admission. The proposed approach is a drinkable formulation to stop bleeding after ingestion, eliminating the need for endoscopic intervention or hospitalization. The technology developed in this project could then be applied to other bleeding scenarios, including field/combat medicine or rapid treatment of hemorrhage during surgical complications. The gel can also be used as a drug delivery vehicle for a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new approach to achieve hemostasis in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), based on a novel thermosensitive gel (thermogel) formulation. The drinkable formulation is liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a mucoadhesive gel when warmed to body temperature, thereby treating hemorrhage in the upper GI tract without the need for endoscopic intervention. Its action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) The in situ gelation of the mucoadhesive thermogel provides a mechanical barrier against blood flow, and (2) the slow release of drugs from the thermogel at the hemorrhage site enables more rapid healing. Initial efforts will be dedicated to formulation development wherein compatibility of the thermogel with different drug candidates will be evaluated, and optimization of the gelation temperature will be performed. The best formulations will then be tested in vitro for stability, drug release kinetics, and mucoadhesion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach will be assessed in preclinical models of bleeding, demonstrating its superior ability to reach hemostasis. This is expected to apply to disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and oral mucositis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the creation of a "digital twin," a real-world system projected into spatially-computed environment such as virtual and augmented reality. This technology creates the infrastructure necessary for the application of virtual and augmented reality in industrial workplaces, at scale. By making the full-scale roll out of these technologies possible, the technology seeks to impact human health and safety, operational efficiencies, and environmental risk reduction for process operations facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The long term impacts of the technology may also enable automation and optimization, improving their efficiency, security, and safety. Such facilities are critical infrastructure and play a significant role in the national economy. The availability of this product may also enhance market opportunities for other businesses in the scanning, spatial computing, and training markets. The impact may be further broadened by adapting the process for digital twin production to new domains unrelated to the industrial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing knowledge and understanding in both machine learning and spatial computing. This project focuses on a method for digitizing a complex, real-world system, in an efficient manner, sufficient to recreate the captured reality as an interactive digital twin. The primary technical hurdle is the combining of different data sources that describe aspects of a particular real-world system into a single complete description. The initial physical systems being modelled are industrial process operations, but the core methods could apply to other types of systems, including natural systems, such as a rainforest. For industrial process operations, the goal is to encode the entire process operations facilities at the component level, with sub-cm accuracy, at 10% of the current time and cost requirements. To achieve this, this project will combine physical scans with engineering documentation and relational probabilities. Once combined, the model will be used as the basis for a digital twin of the real-world system projected into spatial computed environments, such as virtual and augmented reality. These techniques replace a tedious and impractical static scan and human labor workflow with rapid scans, computer vision, and a combination of procedural and trained algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of
    conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often
    uncomfortable in the early days because they aren’t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student
    personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be development of a novel platform for the design and high-volume fabrication of microfluidic devices for educational and research purposes. Currently used fabrication methods are not conducive to the large-scale production of robust, high quality, open-channel microfluidic devices that are cost-effective for widespread use outside of specialty applications. The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels. The kits will contribute to educational efforts that address the nation’s demand for STEM professionals, projected to grow at twice the rate of all occupations in the next 10 years, while training students in a field expected to reach a $60 billion market value by 2029.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to eliminate the main technical hurdles that prevent the large scale production of open-channel microfluidic devices. Current lithographic, additive and micromilling fabrication technologies require a combination of expertise, equipment and production time that make them ill-suited for the purpose of assembling devices that are inexpensive and robust enough for consumer use, for example, in educational settings. The proposed platform will leverage new and existing high-volume fabrication technologies to manufacture film-based devices with channels and chambers measured in the tens and hundreds of micrometers, featuring strong bonding between layers to allow for high pressure flow, and at a projected cost of <0.15 USD per device. Research objectives include the development of gravity-based and hand powered pump setups appropriate for educational and low resource settings. The advancements in device fabrication processes achieved in this project are expected to have a positive impact beyond the field of education, facilitating the commercialization of microfluidic technologies in fields like analytical chemistry, biomanufacture and point-of-care biosensing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a stronger understanding of how living things absorb carbon in the ocean. It is important to have an accurate measure of the natural carbon uptake by the ocean because this affects ocean and fishery health, as well as future efforts to intentionally sequester carbon in the ocean to mitigate climate change. This goal will be achieved by developing a low-cost sensor that can be widely deployed on ocean robots, which are already being used to measure processes like ocean heat uptake. The sensor will use light to detect sinking debris in the ocean.  This debris is a major way that carbon is naturally sequestered in the ocean. Distributed, robotic platforms in the ocean allow observations to be made in locations and seasons that are not accessible with research ships. Such platforms are generally lower cost than sensors associated with research ships. Development and sale of sensors for robotic platforms are areas of growth because of the increasing reliance on these platforms for scientific observations. This project may also enhance academic and industry partnerships and help to train upcoming scientists and engineers in instrument development.

    There is a significant desire to expand measurements of ocean biological carbon pump processes to better understand climate change, in particular the flux of carbon by particles settling out of the surface ocean. This project will create a sensor that is designed to be carried aboard globally distributed, autonomous profiling floats.  The sensors/floats may help distinguish among the different modes of biological carbon uptake in the ocean. The sensor will be designed from the ground up to meet the challenges of sampling floats, which have stringent power consumption, cost, and data quality-control requirements. The sensor will also have specific optical and housing geometry characteristics tailored for measurement of sinking particle fluxes. The development stages will consist of optical modeling of proposed sensor geometries, modeling of particle collection efficiencies of different housing geometries, laboratory testing of model particles, and dissemination of results to the scientific community.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – often called “forever” chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.

    \ resuscitation (e.g., chest compressions) and prompt defibrillation using an\
    \ automated external defibrillator (AED). In locations with publicly-available\
    \ AEDs, survival has increased 40%-70%. However, ~70% of OHCAs events occur in\
    \ private residence, and public-access AEDs are not available for these patients.\
    \ Drones can deliver AEDs to the scene of a cardiac arrest more quickly than a\
    \ ground ambulance team, enabling early defibrillation by bystanders with the\
    \ potential for substantive improvements in survival rates. The impact on EMS\
    \ response times will likely be greatest for patients currently not well served\
    \ by EMS systems such as individuals living in poor and minority neighborhoods.\
    \ EMS drones can also address other health problems such as delivering naloxone\
    \ for opioid overdoses and blood products for the pre-clinical treatment of hemorrhagic\
    \ shock. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project addresses critical barriers to creating\
    \ a 911-integrated drone service. First, it develops algorithms to optimize the\
    \ spatial distribution of drones given performance parameters. Second, it integrates\
    \ the emergency care drone response directly into the 911 dispatch process. The\
    \ system uses state-of-the-art prediction and data integration solutions to provide\
    \ real-time launch decision support and asset tracking capabilities to the 911\
    \ dispatcher. The result is a drone response system that is accurate, fast, and\
    \ scalable. The project focuses on delivering automated external defibrillators\
    \ to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The decision support system and\
    \ underlying algorithms developed in this work can be applied to other use cases\
    \ integrating drone services into the 911 response.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's\
    \ statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using\
    \ the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to remediate the 17 million tons of textile waste that ends up in landfills annually. Working within the existing economic drivers of the clothing industry, this project aims to deploy technology that can profitably transition the USA away from a wasteful zero-sum linear raw materials model into a resilient local and sustainable circular economy. This project will enable local communities, urban and rural alike, to create economic value (raw materials and jobs) out of textile waste, with a drastic reduction in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions compared to business as usual. This project will develop technology that has an impact on the security and sustainability of the US textile raw materials marketplace, by enabling a re-shoring of an industry in a distributed way that can affect every single American through their clothing purchasing options. If successful, the US could lead the world into a new era of a truly sustainable circular economy for fashion.

    This project aims to advance knowledge and develop the core technologies required for widespread adoption and commercialization of cellulosic textile recycling within the American textile manufacturing industry. By leveraging core competencies and innovative models for polymer science and continuous process design, this project will develop a non-destructive extractive process that will locally and domestically convert end-of-life textile waste into high-value cellulosic circular economy feedstocks of equal or greater quality to virgin material at kilogram scale. As part of this project, the focus will be on extracting cellulose from mixed material textile waste that contain other contaminant components that often hinder its recycling. This approach involves innovative mixtures of green chemistry that enable the rapid extraction of cotton, the spinning of novel fibres, and the efficient recovery of the process chemicals. This project will optimise and further develop this core technology and conduct the prototyping and engineering design required for reproducible cellulosic material (cotton) extraction from clothing waste and its demonstration at multi-kg scale.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality and reproducibility of cancer diagnosis and margin screening.Surgery currently represents the best opportunity for curing invasive cancers but is limited by modern pathology methods. Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for skin cancer because it results in the highest cure rates, but it often takes place in stages, extending surgical procedures. The use of ex vivo confocal microscopy (XVM) is potentially faster, less costly, and inherently both 3-D and digitized, with benefits including: 1) enhanced accuracy, precision, and margin control via enriched 3D information content and simplified specimen orientation maintenance, decreasing error and improving functional outcomes; 2) decreased duration of open surgical wounds potentially reducing the rate of complications; and (3) enhanced and accelerated surgical workflows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve Mohs surgery and other margin screening applications. Using confocal image processing software, the proposed software will improve current pathology processing methods by enabling rapid processing and re-coloring of XVM images, visualization without the need for retraining, and automated detection of residual tumor at the patient’s bedside, all within minutes. The research described here will result in the production of a fully functional and robust software product through the following development projects: 1) Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software for image preprocessing and colorization/enhancement, and 2) AI-based software for automated identification of key morphological features and diagnosis of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The proposed technology will streamline cancer specimen processing, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses poor long-term public health outcomes stemming from lifestyle choices through an intuitive and effective tool to analyze and optimize their sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mental health. The technology will guide users through an individualized health and well-being analysis based on real-time data that presents an individualized baseline and heat map that helps individuals determine which lifestyle behaviors are most beneficial or detrimental towards their holistic health. This personalized approach seeks to establish new habits, interventions, medications, diets, etc.  This tool may help people to live longer and more fulfilled lives with fewer health concerns and costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project determines the viability of objective measurement of health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, sleep cycles, and exercise) through the integration of already-existent technologies including, but not limited to, wearables and “smart” technologies such as Smart Scales and Smart Blood Pressure cuffs. Additionally, this project will determine the viability of using subjective inputs surrounding diet, mood, and exercise and the ability to draw meaningful correlations between both subjective and objective inputs. This project will develop and validate methods to integrate these two data streams into a health scoring system that may be used to improve physical and mental health and fitness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to help the 60% of the 21 million African American women in the US who are overweight or obese, increasing their risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in greater severity than the general population.  This project overcomes barriers to weight management in African American women through its customized data library. The proposed automated food tracker is combined with a social network function to incentivize new users to engage with the application. These features provide a powerful tool for the user to achieve a healthy body mass index and maintain health over a lifetime.

    The proposed project is a mobile weight-loss management application to help African American manage diet and track physical activity. It helps women build their knowledge of proper nutrition and follow a healthy lifestyle, thereby improving adherence rates for diet and exercise regimens. The application's innovation is to automate the tracking of food intake from the users with image recognition and machine learning algorithms. This innovation creates a unique data set for foods common in the African American community, labeling the carbohydrates, calories, proteins, fats, and serving size.  This automatic process provides a framework that eliminates the barriers created by the manual calculations that current solutions require. Furthermore, it will incorporate a game-like interface to increase engagement for better long-term weight management outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities. This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper insights into their customers’ hair care-related goals, pain points, and health conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors (porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1) Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-esteem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the participation of the underrepresented population of blind and low vision (BLV) persons in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Through a novel assistive technology that provides BLV individuals with multisensory access to scientific data in real time, this technology will enable access  on par with sighted peers. BLV students, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data whether in the laboratory or in the field. This inaccessibility either precludes their full participation in hands-on science inquiry, or leaves them dependent on sighted peers to access real-time data. With this project, BLV students across K-12 and post-secondary institutions, as well as BLV scientists and others interested in STEM, will benefit from a tool that makes it possible for them to work independently in laboratory situations. This innovation will make science laboratory learning and laboratory workplaces more inclusive and equitable for the blind and low vision individuals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing a 2-dimensional, hand-held, portable, refreshable Braille and tactile graphics scientific data collection tool that can be used to collect quantifiable data in real time using wireless sensors. Blind and Low Vision (BLV) students are as capable as their sighted peers in STEM yet, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data in the laboratory. This effort seeks to address this inequity by leveraging the expertise of blind scientists and pioneers in STEM access technology to iteratively develop a interative versions of novel, blind-accessible innovations which will give BLV students, scientists and others access to quantitative data collected in the laboratory or in the field. This innovation will be optimized for the BLV by documenting usability concerns and making the necessary modifications to hardware and source-code prior to field-testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enhance the understanding of wireless mesh networks and deep reinforcement learning algorithms in order to significantly expand the coverage and robustness, accelerating Internet of Things (IoT) adoption across the globe. These improvements to sensor systems seek to benefit a range of applications including public safety, smart agriculture, supply chain logistics, smart cities, wildlife monitoring, healthcare and other markets. The coverage and cost benefits are especially impactful for the U.S population in rural or economically-disadvantaged areas that lack cost effective connectivity and are unable to take advantage of the IoT benefits. Further, the project will enhance industry-academia partnership, enable the technology transition of innovations, and expand the participation of women in science, technology, enducation and mathematics (STEM).


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable scalable, longer-lasting, and higher-throughput Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) Internet of Things (IoT) networks by using LPWA IoT Mesh Augmentation (LIMA) devices to augment the connectivity between end-nodes and gateways in a cost-effective and easy-to-deploy manner. The mesh network of LIMA devices will adaptively multi-hop relay messages to maximize effective capacity and range. The teams seeks to augment the connectivity of LoRaWAN (a standard for Long Range Wide Area Networks) with a goal of increasing coverage range several-fold, reducing the battery drain of end-nodes, and enabling higher uplink bitrates. The core challenge for such LIMA is the development of a scalable multi-hop mesh routing protocol that, unlike existing protocols, accommodates the ultra-low bit rates that characterize LPWANs, and is generalizable across the diverse applications of LPWAN technology. The LIMA solution builds upon two synergistic innovations: (a) embedded-control routing, that uses a very small amount of bits in the data packet header in lieu of control packets, and thereby achieves scalability and energy-efficiency in ultra-low-capacity, energy-constrained networks and (b) relational deep reinforcement learning based routing that combines Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks (DeepRL) with the use of relational features to learn routing policies that adapt to a variety of link dynamics and traffic conditions. The LIMA solution does not require changes to end-nodes. The anticipated technical deliverables include mesh networking software, a simulation model, a 4-node prototype using a LoRa integrated circuit, and experimental analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reducing the cost of getting people online and connecting people in emergency situations such as natural disasters. Natural disasters often destroy cellular networks, exactly when people need communication the most. The influx of users on the limited remaining infrastructure often overwhelms existing resources, making it impossible for first responders to coordinate, for families to call their loved ones, and for volunteers to help. In other potential markets, the technology seeks to provide cellular phone access to parts of the world where it is now prohibitively expensive. This project seeks to develop small, portable cellular base stations that can provide access in both emergency and hard to reach and poorly resourced locations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project researches and implements a small, portable cellular base station. The technological focus for the base station utilizes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (or 2G and 2.5G) radio for communicating with a high density of cell phones in a computationally cheap manner while utilizing WiFi for local, high bandwidth applications. The technology implements many “micro-cells” in lieu of the current macro cell approach to cellular coverage, blanketing the area with a high number of towers. This decentralized approach provides high reliability even if one or several nodes fail. This project will develop the algorithms necessary for interconnecting large numbers of base stations together and mesh the networking capabilities that provide radio links between each base station. Finally, this project will finalize the mechanical design and make the base station manufacturable at large scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration with a new type of three-dimensional (3D) sensor. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate in densely crowded spaces in a safe and socially compliant/acceptable manner. A key potential outcome is the development of a collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).  This method would be capable of handling dense crowds and optimized to run on compact and power-efficient embedded processors. Such abilities would increase the commercial potential and adoption of learning-based navigation methods that have demonstrated excellent collision avoidance and noise handling capabilities. The technology may unlock commercial opportunities by deploying AMRs in the airport, retail, healthcare, and hospitality industries, where the environments are highly dense and dynamic. The airport industry may derive postive impacts from AMRs that can navigate in complex, indoor environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are not allowed by providing contactless deliveries of food, beverages, and other retail products to travelers at the gate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a hybrid collision avoidance approach enabling autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate safely in dense crowds, while being socially-compliant in sparse scenarios. Preliminary research has shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches can compute collision-free robot velocities with inaccurate, uncertain perception data. The proposed DRL-based model will be implemented as an optimized neural network that works on power and cost-efficient embedded processors.  The key technical hurdles in this technology are: the DRL model trained in simulation may not perform well in real-world environments (known as sim-to-real gap), the fully-trained DRL model may have some performance degradation compared to the company’s current DRL models due to the lower number of parameters used to run on embedded processors, and the localization modules could compute erroneous locations when the AMR is navigating through a dense crowd due to occlusions. The key objectives of Phase I are to address these challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the reduction of honey bee colony mortality by up to 75% through early identification and improved breeding of pest- and disease-resistant colonies. Honey bees are dying at unprecedented rates, with annual losses up to 45% in the United States. A primary cause of colony death is the parasitic mite Varroa. The unhealthy brood odor (UBO) assay is a pheromone-based tool that reduces labor costs required to measure Varroa-resistance by 18x, accelerating decision-making by 20%. The assay’s user-friendly design makes honey bee selection and queen evaluation more accessible to beekeepers, who are often restricted by the high technical skill and/or extensive labor required for existing assays. The UBO assay has potential to improve honey bee health and increase profitability of beekeeping operations, and thus may significantly improve global crop pollination and food security.

    The proposed project will assess the technical feasibility of using a honey bee pheromone-based assay to predict colony-level disease- and pest-resistance. This novel tool has the potential to improve honey bee health, revolutionize honey bee breeding, and inform important apiary management decisions, as it improves efficiency and efficacy of honey bee selection by enabling rapid and accurate identification of Varroa-resistant honey bee colonies. However, to be highly effective and achieve widespread uptake the technology must be practically and economically accessible, must perform consistently despite environmental variability, and must be established as a reliable indicator of heritable Varroa-resistance traits. The proposed research will employ sophisticated behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery, reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of Varroa-resistance traits identified by colony response to the prototype assay. Expected results include improvements to the safety and efficiency of the product delivery system, improved understanding of the effects of environmental variability on product performance, and confirmation of the heritability of traits identified by honey bee behavioral response to in-hive tests of the product.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve reuse of wastewater.  This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.

    The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities—by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.

    The Broader Impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support widespread distribution and adoption of sterilizing biopesticides that are effective and efficient to control Lepidoptera. Lepidopterans, such as the corn earworm, circumvent insecticidal properties of certain crops by developing resistance.  Models show that incorporating sterile insects in a corn earworm population can suppress the incidence of resistant individuals in the populations.  Enhancing oral infectivity of this sterilizing insect biopesticide will improve product manufacturing, distribution and most importantly, ease of use to support farmer adoption.

    The proposed project develops a functional orally-infectious formula of a specific strain of the sexually-transmitted, sterilizing-virus, Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV2). The resulting technology will be suitable for prototyping and testing oral formulations for sterilizing adult corn earworm moths. Genetic selection and candidate gene approaches are proposed to improve stability of the virus entry complex required for oral infectivity. This project will decorate viral envelopes with genes absent from HzNV-2 and thereby improve virion stability.  The pseudotyped virus will be assayed for increased oral infectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).  Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.  This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.

    The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.  The project will develop a test to measures a compound's biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project addresses a paradox faced by ‘open web’ developers, users, and regulators: the use of centralized platform-creator hosted web portals to interact with an evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) application ecosystem. The proposed work will instrument a new open web paradigm that will improve user accessibility and ability to compose and perform data analysis on smart contracts. The approach will enable improvement of web-service reliability and security while weeding out bad actors.  Improving the accessibility and analysis of smart contracts is anticipated to help unlock further value and solutions across a range of applications and new business opportunities that can benefit from dynamic contracting.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build a blockchain-adjacent metadata model that enhances the utility and security of smart contracts for users and developers. The project will undertake the practical challenge of reverse-engineering smart contracts to outline a metadata model which will enhance discovery and security of services, creating a scaffold for composable apps. The approach will organize blockchain abstractions through code similarity analysis and program de-obfuscation by reverse engineering, instrument compile-time creation and publish metadata models by developers, and demonstrate how this data can be used to build a composable app user experience. The project will deploy privacy-preserving targeted advertising frameworks using deterministic services alongside the data from the metadata model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of lightweight, thermally safe batteries with high energy densities that can be charged fast, last a long time, are composed of environmentally benign materials, and can store energy at a low cost. Such batteries would enable the large-scale penetration of long-range electric cars and other electric vehicles, including airplanes and drones in transportation.  This process reduces environmental pollution and leads to greater energy efficiency.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to use boron nitride based layered ceramic materials as a means of storing electrochemical energy in solid state batteries.  This project enhances scientific and technological understanding on the design of advanced functional materials for energy storage at the atomic level.  To achieve the targeted high performance energy storage at the macroscopic level, the underlying material structures must be carefully selected on the atomic and molecular levels.  Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, may contain functional groups that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized and can be utilized as electroactive species in cathodes of rechargeable batteries. The great advantage of these materials is that they can realize simultaneously high energy and power density for thousands of charging/discharging cycles as demonstrated in graphene oxide batteries with lithium and sodium anodes.  Graphene oxide is, however, thermally unstable.  The project proposes to substitute graphene oxide with functionalized boron nitride in order to achieve thermal stability while preserving performance.  Furthermore, the functionalized boron nitride is also capable to play the role of a solid electrolyte in addition to being an electroactive species.  Particular focus will be made on synthesizing -OBF3 functionalized boron nitride. This functional group occurs as a Lewis adduct of surface oxides (such as graphene oxide or boron nitride oxide) with BF3 (an electrolyte component) and is particularly promising as a compact electroactive species and electrolyte.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content is commonly limited to very short clips (typically < 10 seconds) due to huge file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices. both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment and telecommunications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable. The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time. There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard HD video content.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of semiconductor chips.  Specifically, it develops a novel method to operate directly on compressed data, saving time, energy, and latency.  This improved performance will affect computationally intensive applications such as medical imaging (e.g., CT/MRI), climate simulation, hurricane warnings, and earthquake alerts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a method to operate on compressed data. Today, computers apply data compression to identify and remove redundancy in the data in order to save storage space.  Computers apply arithmetic to compute in integers or real numbers (usually represented internally as floating-point data).  However, today's computers first decompress the data, compute, and then compress the computed result, consuming additional time and energy.  This project develops an arithmetic and math hardware accelerator capable of processing compressed data directly to dramatically improve computation performance, storage effectiveness, and energy efficiency.  This project combines data compression and floating-point engineering to deliver the first-ever Compressed Floating-Point Unit (CFPU) that minimizes semiconductor and energy usage and reduces computation latency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safe, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy storage solution.  This project offers a non-chemical, non-hazardous alternative energy storage to accelerate grid modernization and non-polluting renewable power integration.  The project’s core technology is a design that is cost competitive with deployed Lithium ion (Li-ion) chemical batteries, but would be significantly less expensive per charge than Li-ion over its 30+ year service life.  This proposed approach allows the long-term advantages of kinetic (flywheel) energy storage (low service life costs, high power throughput, high daily charge cycles, no battery replacements, potential for 24/7 operations) and makes it affordable and safer for deployed stationary grid operations. With solar and wind renewables on par with traditional carbon-based power generation costs, affordable flywheel energy storage is vital to store and dispense intermittent renewable power, enabling the replacement of carbon-based power generation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a comprehensive testing effort to verify the technical feasibility of the project’s 3D flywheel composite structure for next-generation energy storage systems. The proposed research and testing objectives are to demonstrate the improved 3D flywheel performance and projected 9x reduction in the traditional flywheel weight for the same energy storage capability. Testing methodology includes dynamic balancing, torque transmission determination, critical failure/fatigue modeling, assessing magnetically coupled commercial external motor/generator power transmission and performance in a TRL-5 operational vacuum environment. The effort will also include energy storage market analysis for commercial market entry based on tested 3D flywheel performance. Anticipated results include the characterization of the 3D flywheel structural technology, demonstrated commercial subsystem operations and readiness to develop a full prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to improve the assessment of cognitive and motor skills in K-6 students. More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to enhance the health of livestock without addition of synthetic antibiotic and antioxidant compounds. The proposed technologies are corn kernel fiber byproducts of ethanol production from corn. The need for such compounds has grown as livestock is now more often raised in concentrated animal feeding operations that confine animals and result in abnormal oxidative stress. The program is based on extracting these naturally occurring compounds from agricultural residues.  These extracts can be used in place of antibiotics and synthetic supplements currently in livestock feeds.  The process proposed will enable production at a cost competitive with synthetic supplements.

    This STTR project proposes to assess the biological activity of hydroxy cinnamic acids and their oligomers (HCAs) as beneficial supplements in livestock feed. They are ester-linked to a hemicellulose known to occur in seed crop brans. The linkage is hydrolyzed during pretreatment of corn bran fiber to prepare it for conversion to ethanol and the HCAs dissolve in the pretreatment solution. As free acids they recover their character, which includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The project will provide kilogram quantities of HCAs for use in feeding trials with young swine, wherein they will be compared with naturally sourced feed supplements currently in use in Europe, as well as un-supplemented feed. Components of the extract will be identified and comprehensive biochemical analyses performed, including study of the gastrointestinal physiology and intestinal permeability. Studies will also be performed of gut microbiomes and how the processes involved are influenced by substitution of HCAs as the primary feed supplement. Successful completion of these studies will provide a basis for more comprehensive studies of the use of HCAs as supplements in the diet of other livestock.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide open and secure management of transactions between multiple parties in a supply chain. The lack of transparent information throughout the supply chain has eroded the trust and value of many perishable products and the brands they represent. The proposed project addresses the current issue of tracking and traceability of food products in a trusted manner. Through the development of a hybrid blockchain that is sensor aware, all the parties involved in the distribution of the goods will ensure that the food quality is maintained by entering transactions into a secure blockchain. The result is two-fold: consumers will be assured that they are getting the right goods and suppliers can trust that their products are being delivered with quality. While initially focused on the $2 billion food transaction market, the commercial potential will expand to a broader range of products that require secure traceability including consumer goods, home delivery and medical products.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the core technology for the hybrid blockchain and test the functionality in a live commercial setting. The technology represents the first-in-class solution that leverages blockchain and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with integrated sensor and hybrid datasets to address the perishable nature of food products. The blockchain model will assume that a transaction is an event of data transfer and that there can be many disjointed events even on a small-scale supply chain network. For traceability, novel algorithms will be designed, making it feasible to connect disjointed events using geometry and a pseudo-Boolean function on top of a system that assigns a unique code. This implementation uses multivariate time series and node features for the meaningful aggregation and disaggregation of datasets, such as data collected by sensors and participating members. Putting such multivariate time series on the graph where participants are nodes with their pairwise relations as edges, the technology will address the novel optimization problem for efficient real-time monitoring and assist in providing further assurance of transaction integrity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve lowering the barrier to adoption of renewable energy generation and energy storage. The project seeks to take advantage the sheer abundance and low costs of sodium materials compared to state-of-the-art lithium materials. This will reduce upfront energy storage cost and in turn the payback time and costs of electricity for end users can be significantly reduced. The United States has 23 billion tons of domestic sodium reserves, which makes up 88% of the global supply of sodium. Successful utilization of the vast U.S. sodium reserves in new battery technologies will significantly reduce import reliance of critical materials and alleviate supply chain limitations on lithium-based materials. This project will accelerate the adoption of solar and renewable energy generation, making the grid cleaner, more sustainable, and more resilient.

    This research project advances new batteries enabled by a novel halide-based sodium solid state electrolyte. The technology offers several beneficial properties compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries: enhanced safety due to the use of completely nonflammable materials, higher volumetric energy density by using a dense alloy-based anode, lowered costs due to the abundance of sodium-based raw materials, and improved longevity from the use of superior halide-based solid-state electrolytes. Unlike the commonly used sulfide-based or oxide-based solid electrolyte materials, the halide-based innovation provides enhanced electrochemical and chemical stability while eliminating the need for high temperature sintering during fabrication. This project develops the halide solid electrolyte material, improving its baseline material ionic conductivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, as well as exploring scalable synthesis routes using single-step fabrication at room temperature.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new class of batteries for transportation. The proposed battery design will maximize the rate of charge and battery lifetime while maintaining high energy density, in contrast with current battery research that primarily focuses on maximizing energy density. This new operating parameter will open the design space for smaller batteries that result in lighter weight, lower cost and longer life vehicle platforms to enable all-electric transportation. In addition, the new operating parameters enable the widespread adoption of two new applications, (i) vehicle to grid and (ii) mobility as a service. The associated reduction of greenhouse gases will be 1+ gigaton annually.

    The proposed project develops a lithium battery coin cell that demonstrates 3 minutes ultrafast charge and 20,000 extended cycle life performance, using the novel disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode. This project explores ultrafast charge lithium ion battery platforms.  Technical objectives include: 1) charging times comparable to filling up today's gas tanks; 2) batteries with a higher safety profile that last the entire service life of the vehicle; 3) vehicles that can connect to the electric grid for renewables integration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.

    The SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve capacitor technology in power conversion equipment used to electrify our transportation systems. Capacitors are critical components to the systems needed to accelerate the energy transition from petroleum to other fuels. This project will develop new electrical materials and production processes for capacitors. The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles. Through development of these new electrode materials and processes, manufacturing of capacitors in the United States will be available to serve the growing US electric vehicle industry.

    This goal of the proposed work is to develop electrode materials and roll-to-roll processes compatible with an integrated, continuous manufacturing process for multilayer capacitor products. By combining additive manufacturing process in a roll-to-roll system, sequential deposition, drying, and curing of alternating layers of dielectrics and electrodes will enable production of multilayer capacitors in a single system at atmospheric pressure. Electrode inks and printing processes used in flexible/hybrid electronics do not meet the specifications to replace vacuum-based evaporation or sputtering of thin electrode layers for capacitor applications. The primary approach will be based on adapting the layer coating and alignment techniques developed for dielectrics to conductive materials. These electrode materials will improve upon state-of-the-art conductive inks with poor interfaces between particles to produce dense layers with uniform thickness and low surface roughness. This project seeks to provide prototyping of multilayer capacitors produced in discrete processing steps for verification of electrical performance.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to digitize access to high-quality custom prosthetic and orthotic devices. This will increase convenience and reduce the cost of care for millions of people with limb loss or other disabilities. In 2018, the leading cause of amputations was complications from diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases, and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older. Despite progress in other aspects of prosthetic limb design, inefficiencies in the design and manufacture of the custom prosthetic socket still exist. The proposed technology uses a computational approach to digitize the biomechanical design required to develop high-quality, custom prosthetic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to digitize and automate customization of wearable devices that conform to the portion of a person’s limb remaining after an amputation. The function of this device (i.e. prosthetic socket) is to re-distribute pressure to areas of the person’s soft tissues that tolerate those pressures. This project will introduce new guidelines and processes for prosthetic socket design. The objectives include: (1) codify, modify, and implement existing design guidelines within a biomechanics engine to manage customizations for the individual user; and (2) implement a machine learning framework using training datasets of paired limbs and prosthetic sockets. The techniques developed by this work can be extended to other biomechanical processes with load/pressure transfer considerations beyond prosthetics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve health care outcomes associated with complex procedures.  Approximately 1 in 7 major surgical procedures in the US is associated with a medical complication, totaling more than 4 million complications and $80 billion in costs per year. Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.  A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is inconsistently structured and not optimized to directly improve patient outcomes. The large datasets for most procedures provide only high-level conclusions regarding risk; they do not pinpoint the specific steps in provider workflow with high risk or the role of external factors, such as comorbidities or facility age. This project will determine the feasibility of using machine learning supervised by experienced clinicians to assess risk using principles from Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. The project will develop a proof-of-concept machine-learning system that uses a proprietary risk taxonomy and modifiers to combine national, state, facility, and actuarial datasets to generate risk priority numbers for each step for a service line. This system will then be applied to coronary artery bypass graft surgery to assess its validity and clinical value. Monte Carlo simulations and clinician focus groups using a Likert scale will determine the significance of the results.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide waste concrete as a new raw material source for the glass and other industries.  It is estimated that 2.2 billion tons of waste concrete is generated globally each year.  About 70% of the construction waste generated in the US is concrete, but it is not typically used as a raw material for glass production or other chemical processes.  Using concrete as a raw material reduces its contribution to landfills as well as the need for mining virgin raw materials., and contributes environmental benefits.  This STTR Phase I project will study processes to prepare furnace-ready concrete for glass production.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the feasibility of waste concrete as a raw material constituent (feedstock) for calcium-silicate glass and glass-making.  Environmental benefits are possible because concrete contains the same key oxides used in glass making (silicon, calcium, aluminum and iron oxides) as well as sulfur compounds (e.g. gypsum mixed with the cement to regulate setting, and therefore can potentially serve as a candidate raw material in the production of calcium-silicate soda lime and calcium-borosilicate glasses.Research objectives include: 1) characterize variations in chemical composition from industrially relevant sources; 2) determine variation in contaminant concentrations; 3) demonstrate processes and methods to address contaminant variations' 4) characterize the specifications for a furnace-ready waste concrete glass batch; 5) produce pilot batches of calcium-silicate soda lime glass; and 6) characterize variations in produced glasses.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the lab-on-a-chip and other related life science platforms by the introduction of a new standardized microfluidic chip interface. The proposed project advances a novel interface to advance the applications and capabilities of microfluidic chips in both medical and non-medical fields, including dramatically increasing the rate at which doctors and medical researchers can prepare and perform diagnostic tests. The interface enables easy interoperability of devices as the chips can be freely switched out while the result of the hardware remains the same. The success of this project could lead to great breakthroughs in bioenergy, medical diagnostics, and drug therapeutics.

    The proposed project undertakes the development of chip interfaces with reduced size and increased channel density by making use of novel interfacing and sealing methods, on a reusable micro-patterned surface. While the technology exists to fabricate microfluidic chips with much smaller dimensions, with more complex on-chip operations, and at a reduced cost, the current limitation is the size of the interfaces bridging the microscopic world of the fluid microchip with the macroscopic world of the laboratory. The work proposed herein could enable chips with 16x the density of sample channels, allowing for vastly more complex diagnostics to be performed and thereby vastly reducing the sample volume needed for accurate diagnostics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to combat online trade in counterfeit and illicit goods. The project will integrate the results of a decade of academic research on anonymous online ("dark net") marketplaces and modeling of counterfeit pharmaceutical online sales with novel monitoring solutions for traditional e-commerce marketplaces. It will allow for the development and validation through pilot customer tests of an integrated platform for automated continuous data collection and analysis of the major players in the counterfeit and illicit goods online business. Through automation, the proposed technology should considerably reduce costs to brand protection managers (and law enforcement), allowing them to use their limited resources more effectively. This work should also help address some pressing economic and public health issues linked to the proliferation of counterfeits, such as counterfeit drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate automation of many manual online counterfeiting monitoring activities. The project will also show that intuitive visual interfaces can help customers (law enforcement agencies, brand protection managers) have immediate access to higher-level objects more useful for investigative purposes. These higher-level objects include metrics on the amount of sales conducted by a specific entity, deduplication between vendors, or inventory clustering. To do so, the project will further develop automated classification and analysis using techniques that were prototyped in the research lab, scale these techniques up to a production environment to further minimize human intervention, and combine these techniques with novel algorithms developed for slightly different application cases (traditional e-commerce marketplaces).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the success rates of cancer therapy, reduce the costs and duration of treatment, and to improve patients’ life quality. More than 70% of the 16 million Americans diagnosed with cancer will undergo ineffective chemotherapy cycles through trial-and-error methods. On average, a cycle of chemotherapy costs $30 k and takes 12 weeks to complete; cancer patients undergo 5-6 cycles at a cost of an estimated $180 k. This project advances a method to pre-screen response to chemotherapy drugs so that clinicians can select the most effective treatment, consequently shortening the duration, reducing complications, improving outcomes, and reducing the financial burden. The technology uses a quick, single-step, scalable, inexpensive, and automated process that tests a wide range of drugs in less than a week. With this technology, the oncologist will be able to select the most effective chemotherapy drug for a cancer patient, on an individualized basis and prior to initiating treatment. The proposed personalized approach would reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles to 1-2, and save up to $120 k per treatment, generating annual national savings of $18.2 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development, proof-of-concept validation, and preclinical evaluation of an automated biochip platform that grows patients’ cancer cells outside the body to screen them against chemotherapeutic drugs. In the research described herein, tumor specimens from patient biopsies will be grown and maintained as microtumors in the biochips to recapitulate clinical tumor behavior. The biochips and process will be optimized to create microtumors that can be used toward evaluating the performance of cancer treatment. Research objectives are to I) evaluate, refine, and optimize the design of the biochips through simulation studies to ensure compatibility with native tumor microstructure and mass transfer behavior; II) evaluate the formation, growth, and behavior of patient-derived microtumors in the biochips; and III) investigate the response of patient-derived microtumors to anti-cancer drugs in comparison to longitudinal clinical data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable the efficient emulation on classical computers of simulations carried out on quantum computing hardware. The proposed emulator technology is expected to address problems an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present using classical computing hardware. The emulator will be specifically designed for electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials. The successful completion of this project will disrupt the research and development associated with the use of quantum computing in the pharmaceutical and materials spaces by enabling faster assessment and development of quantum algorithms. Since it is widely accepted that these are impactful early applications of emerging quantum computing platforms, there is a paramount need for creating a user- and developer-friendly software stack specifically tailored for such simulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a quantum emulator on the basis of the so-called matrix-product-state (MPS) representation of fermionic wave functions. The innovation results from the fact that the proposed emulator will be specifically designed for fermions and therefore can take advantage of the physical symmetries inherent in these systems. The first-principles MPS wavefunction ansatz has been developed in the quantum chemistry community in the context of the ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) over the past two decades, and will be generalized such that the same APIs as used for the standard quantum emulator will be exposed to users. The proposed new software is expected to allow for emulation of quantum simulations involving 100 spin orbitals/50 electrons, or more, on commodity classical computing hardware, which is an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present. In this SBIR Phase I project, a Python prototype and associated command-line tools will be completed to demonstrate the technology and commercial viability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project isto improve the outcomes for implant procedures for soft tissue healing. More than 2 million musculoskeletal repair surgeries are performed in the U.S. each year, representing a $5 B market. Instead of conventional 3D printing that completely melts or fuses synthetic biopolymers into solid and rigid objects, this project will develop a novel 3D microfiber printing process project to rapidly and economically produce clinical-grade printed implants with better performance.  This technology will offer a significant reduction in the cost of goods and a faster product development cycle. The novel implants will be available in markets wherein existing products are prohibitively expensive, including ambulatory surgical centers, wherein most of these surgical procedures are performed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will progress the design and engineering for a novel 3D microfiber printer that can assemble clinically relevant synthetic biopolymer filaments into fibrous, flexible, high void/porosity implants to promote soft tissue healing. This approach offers improvements in quality, cost, speed, and manufacturability. This project will explore the material strength, cytocompatibility, and biocompatibility using industry-standard testing. Expected technical results include quantitative measures for a controlled fibrous 3D printing method compatible with diverse synthetic biopolymers and across clinical indications. This project will optimize the hardware engineering, polymer, and print configuration.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project improves treatment of viral conditions, starting with influenza. Each year seasonal influenza infects 9–35 million individuals, causes 56,000 deaths in the U.S., and costs $87.1 billion.  The proposed technology has the potential to produce more rapid protection, expand pathogen/variant coverage, and extend the longevity of protection afforded by influenza vaccination and other vaccines. This added protection will reduce the high healthcare costs and productivity losses due to mortality/morbidity. This technology has the potential to serve as a rapidly deployable prophylactic or vaccine adjuvant to enhance protection and reduce the necessary vaccine dose, expanding access and providing a timelier response.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a next-generation vaccine adjuvant platform. While vaccines represent a major medical success, several diseases have proven difficult to address, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. One way to improve the efficacy of vaccines for these diseases is to use an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response to the antigen presented via vaccination. The proposed technology has the potential to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of infections directly and via heterologous immunity because the addition of “Stimulator of Interferon Genes” (STING) agonist overproduction to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) serves a dual purpose: it enhances the elevated trained immunity of macrophages already known to be conferred by BCG and promotes critical antiviral IFN-I responses. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Optimize media and lyophilization for manufacturing of BCG-STING; 2) Evaluate the immunological effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 influenza vaccination; and 3) Assess the protective effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 vaccination. This will provide proof of concept for proceeding with the development of this novel recombinant BCG as an efficacy-boosting adjuvant that also offers intrinsic antiviral immunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to improve the outcomes of patients suffering sudden cardiac arrest. Approximately 650,000 cardiac arrests occur each year, representing the top reason for mortality and morbidity in the US and an estimated $33 billion a year for out-of-hospital costs. Overall survival remains generally below 10%, and patients are often left with significant neurological injury. Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) still remains one of the most effective treatments, resulting in better outcomes than current technologies. This project will develop a novel medical device that provides a novel superior automated CPR therapeutic system. It combines multiple methods of mechanical chest compression to improve patient blood flow during resuscitation.

    This project will advance preclinical research for developing the first clinically effective noninvasive automated CPR device. The system integrates a multimodal approach for delivering mechanical CPR, and therefore represents a significant advancement to current systems that only deliver a single mode of CPR. The automated and programmable prototype will determine the optimal combination of methods and timing, to control multiple pump mechanisms for applying mechanical chest compressions to improve patient outcomes. This Phase I project will conduct optimization studies in a swine model of cardiac arrest and develop a proof-of-concept model. These results will provide the foundation for the next generation system suitable for human use, as well as advance research results on the hemodynamic interactions of pump mechanisms and cardiac electrophysiology during CPR.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve cancer treatment. This project advances a new therapy that targets cancer cells and addresses their malignancies.  Following the initial application of lymphomas, the results obtained herein can be applied to several types of cancer.

    The proposed project will generate Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies to improve treatment for lymphomas.  Currently, these therapies show negative effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and metabolic exhaustion upon reaching the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, low nutrient availability for CAR cells in the tumor microenvironment decreases the efficacy. Therefore, strategies utilizing CAR therapy to help target the tumors and keep these cells sufficiently metabolically fit to perform their functions are beneficial.  The main goal of this project is to test the feasibility of generating biomaterials that maintain activation of immune cells in resource-poor environments. This project will generate CAR-macrophages and test the ability of our biomaterials to maintain metabolic fitness in these cells. Technical activities include: (1) Generate human CAR macrophages using non-viral electroporation, (2) Show proof-of-concept that human CAR macrophages can survive in a resource-poor environment, and (3) Show proof-of-concept that mouse CAR macrophages do not induce toxicity in vivo in mice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a synthetic lung surfactant product for the potential treatment of serious respiratory illnesses in neonatal patients.  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia affects 10,000-15,000 pre-term infants per year and has a high mortality rate. Exposure of immature lung tissue to air results in inflammation and damages lungs and airways. Decreasing  bronchopulmonary dysplasia is anticipated to reduce the number of days infants spend in the hospital, the need for supplemental oxygen, and other burdens on the healthcare system. The average length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is currently 103 days.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project may result in the formulation of synthetic proteins for a bioengineered lung surfactant that contains full-length critical phospholipids and anti-inflammatory agents. Currently, bioengineered pulmonary surfactants are not as effective as animal-derived pulmonary surfactants for the treatment of illnesses related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The synthesis of full-length, native surfactant proteins has yet to be achieved. This research seeks to synthesize proteins which may add significant viscoelasticity to the pulmonary surfactant. The protein will be combined with major surfactant phospholipids and anti-inflammatory therapeutics at defined ratios to potentially generate fully-synthetic pulmonary surfactant preparations with anti-inflammatory properties. These surfactant formulations will be screened in vitro and in vivo using a neonatal rat hyperoxia model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to care for patients suffering from diseases\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a sustainable fashion.  The proposed system can manage MSW without generating toxic air emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 98% compared to landfills and incineration. An additional benefit is that waste does not need to be separated, thereby promoting recycling of glass and metal, as they are left untreated.  In addition, the technology is envisioned to be  affordable and easily deployed to enable on-site treatment, saving transportation costs and associated impact. Finally, the system has the potential to use excess heat to generate electricity and use the by-product effectively. This system promotes a circular economy and supports multiple benefits to the environment.

    This project advances development of a novel system of applying gas plasma to create thermal degradation of MSW.  Phase I objectives are to research, design, construct, and test a prototype and define an industrial-scale design. Tasks include testing functionality and emissions quality with a variety of waste feedstock and operational parameters, and conducting a life cycle analysis. Furthermore, the project will explore the co-generation of electricity and beneficial reuse of the ash by-product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing social enterprises with software that performs social-impact forecasting and tracking using machine learning, computer simulation, and data visualization. These digital tools provide social enterprises with better visibility into where their resources can be invested for maximum impact. The adoption of quantitative data analysis has made commercial enterprises more formidable, but these tools are slow in coming to the $7 trillion world of non-profits, charitable foundations, international development agencies, impact investors, and government agencies. The software informs investment strategies by providing a quantitative estimate of impact-per-dollar. The software will also track the ongoing social impact of each resource allocation, enabling social enterprises to iteratively adapt and improve the efficacy of their operations, and provide more accountability to their funding sources. These software tools can help address some of the most vexing societal concerns than span health, sustainability, poverty, and access to education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project makes use of software data analysis tools including Agent Based Modeling (ABM), machine learning (such as Gradient Boosted Machines and Artificial Neural Networks), and Interactive Data Visualization. Agent Based Modeling involves building a digital simulation of the target ecosystem, capturing the essential actors and behaviors. For example, for the opioid epidemic, this may be the addicts/drugs/doctors/pharma agents, along with their attributes, histories, and interactions with each other. This modeling allows simulation of intervention scenarios and quantification of outcomes. Machine learning techniques, once trained and calibrated with past data on the target ecosystem, provide forecasting and allow the exploration of what-if scenarios. A bottom-up model is built for each target social issue, shared by relevant social enterprises, and calibrated using their collective data and subject matter experts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop low-cost, low-power, wireless sensor networks with long lifetimes for high density deployments in the field, primarily for precision agriculture. Existing solutions in the market consist of sensor modules with bulky batteries and repeaters driven by solar panels which drive up the cost.  These batteries and repeaters are infeasible for large-scale deployments. This project aims to provide sustainable solutions to increase the accuracy and efficiency of agricultural operations, while maximizing the crop yields and minimizing operational costs. The proposed sensor networks may also serve as a solution for military surveillance in the field, forest-fire prediction/mitigation, and smart highways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the use of wake-up receivers for radiofrequency (RF) communications, while also using the RF communications for moisture sensing. This use of wake-up receivers and RF-based sensing brings down the size and cost of the nodes and enables mesh networking. The research objectives of the project include both evaluation of such a network and the determination of the feasibility and reliability of wireless sensor nodes deployed inside the soil across varying soil conditions and permittivity variations. The outcome of the experiments will be a set of specifications for integrated circuits (ICs) and networks required for a dense network deployment in precision agriculture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to empower brain scientists with a high-resolution optical imaging instrument to reach currently inaccessible regions of the brain with minimal damage. The instrument contains thin fiber optics probes that enable access to very narrow cavities within the body or penetration of tissue. Deep brain imaging, photo-stimulation, and photo-ablation are possible applications, all of which could help understand brain function and potentially unlock treatments for brain diseases. The imaging instrument to be developed in this project may be amenable to scientific studies in animal models, addressing the need of neuroscientists and imaging facilities. The proposed technology could bring about innovations in biophotonics instrumentation as well as in the ensuing biomedical applications.  The project seeks to advance novel imaging technologies with broad applicability addressing a new segment in the endoscopy market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a critical need in scientific brain imaging studies for endoscopes that are minimally invasive with a diameter in the order of 100 microns, which represents a cross-area about 10 times smaller than the thinnest existing endoscopes. While current endoscopes are appropriate for insertion in large cavities, their size produces excessive damage in brain imaging applications. The objective is to develop a new class of fundamentally less invasive techniques to investigate novel imaging probes, and to validate a prototype instrument in animal models. It is anticipated that in-vivo imaging of neurons with subcellular resolution at depth will become routine with minimal tissue damage. This novel imaging approach implements wavefront shaping in multimode fibers, using advanced machine learning and signal processing methods, to generate arbitrary digitally-reprogrammable light patterns and 3D images. The ultrathin endomicroscope (UTE) uses a spatial light modulator to first calibrate the fiber and then scan light at high speed, compensating for the inherent modal dispersion and intermodal coupling.

    \ of U.S. citizens cannot access therapy. Patients who live in remote areas, do\
    \ not have access to transportation, or need treatment outside of normal work\
    \ hours are unable to access treatment. Parents of children diagnosed with ASD\
    \ have additional challenges of facing long wait times and lack of input for the\
    \ behavior analyst’s treatment plan. While tele-health treatment has increased\
    \ during the COVID-19 pandemic, speaking by phone or by screen doesn't provide\
    \ the same social-skills therapy as in-person interactions. To solve these challenges,\
    \ this project will create a Virtual Reality (VR) Autism Clinic: an immersive\
    \ virtual reality environment where certified therapists would provide real-time\
    \ treatment rooted in the research of applied behavior analysis. \n\nThis Small\
    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop software that\
    \ incorporates tenets of applied behavior analysis as a simulation tool for individuals\
    \ with ASD to improve their social skills. The project will develop an interactive\

    \ leverage the motivation of individuals diagnosed with autism. The inability\
    \ to  access therapy because of location, lack of transportation, or scheduling\
    \ issues may be significantly reduced by the envisioned end product. The anticipated\
    \ technical result of the proposed project is a remote virtual reality platform\
    \ that simulates and achieves in-person social-skills therapy results. The envisioned\
    \ virtual autism clinic would enable ASD-affected individuals to learn, connect,\
    \ and engage with others in a transformative, scalable, secure, and technically-advanced\
    \ solution.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to proactively identify and resolve mental health issues for children ages 10 - 18 before treatments and consequences become more acute and significantly more costly. This project innovation proposes bringing care to children at the onset of need using chatbot companions tailored deliberately and precisely to each child’s mental healthcare needs. Optionally, a child can be paired with live chat therapists and coaches no matter where the child is — at home, school, or when on their own. The system leverages proven mobile device-accessed Cognitive Behavioral Therapies in tandem with machine learning (ML)-enabled technologies that learn from a variety of interactions with the child to detect and digitally triage their experiences of loneliness, anger, anxiety, and depression and to alert adults when intervention and treatment are deemed necessary. Without appropriate care, these symptoms frequently increase in severity over time and become more difficult to treat.  Intervening early can help slow or halt mental illness, reducing for parents, schools, and society the practical and financial burdens associated with reactive, generalized mental healthcare treatments while nurturing children into happier, healthier adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to build a system to determine the nature and severity of a child’s mental health needs through real-time, early detection. Research reveals children face more barriers than adults when obtaining mental healthcare, especially in rural, marginalized, and low-socioeconomic-status communities. Due to a severe shortage of child behavioral health practitioners across the country, children frequently wait up to a decade between the onset of mental health symptoms and treatment. This project seeks to eliminate the delay between when children first experience mental or emotional needs and when they receive appropriate care, ensuring they flourish—not flounder—during those crucial developmental years. Leveraging ML algorithms and proprietary question weighting, the project focuses on: 1) algorithm development to determine the most effective combination of chatbot and live chat counselor engagements to understand a child’s immediate issues and provide resolutions for the child and their parent(s); 2) improvements to ensure the responses are fit for purpose, recognizing and flagging appropriate conversations for human interaction; and 3) refining the frequency and content of notifications; such as, adaptive motivational messages and recommendations to counselors for tailoring interactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient’s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient’s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients’ mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project’s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project’s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence/machinge learning (AI/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient’s future cognitive function.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to facilitate the blue economy’s continued transition to a big-data paradigm. Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation. The project enables adaptability by using an advanced control model methodology which adjusts the device hardware based on ambient environmental conditions for optimized performance. Due to the deployment environment, this project will capture training data under a laboratory setting, train the control model offline, and apply it in the field by leveraging edge computing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is potential commercial development of superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits with the ability to enable true biological brain-inspired deep neural network circuit algorithms and to improve efficiency, speed, and scalability of NC by orders of magnitude. The knowledge and approaches developed through this effort may help advance the foundational development of next generation computing hardware, helping NC continue its advance toward broad market adoption, and helping the US maintain its position as a leader in processor development and production. Additionally, the integrated synthesis-characterization-application approach can be extended to a range of applications, including sensors, metamaterials, catalysis, and renewables, which require atomic-scale control of materials and interfaces. Finally, through a partnership with University of Kansas, the project will facilitate university technology transfer and will serve to educate the next generation of materials and advanced electronics scientists and engineers. The atomic-to-nanoscale design, fabrication, characterization, and application experience will not only assist in recruiting top-quality students and provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits consisting of atomically tunable memristors (synapses) with superconductor interconnects and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs, neurons). This superconducting NC circuit aims to enable true biological brain-inspired deep network circuit algorithms and to achieve currently unattainable levels of energy efficiency, switching speed, and scalability in NC.  The proposed research will design, fabricate, and characterize superconducting memristor-SQUID NC circuit hardware including development of the corresponding algorithms for pattern recognition, with machine learning capabilities, using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database to prove viability. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is illustrated in: (1) novel, atomically-tunable memristors with 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic range in the on/off ratio and switching frequency that can enable spikes of different amplitudes and frequencies as demanded for emerging deep circuits, (2) SQUID neurons with very high sensitivity and low noise, and (3) neurons and interconnects that can significantly reduce power consumption by eliminating the parasitic wire resistance that, in current NC circuits, increases substantially with circuit scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions in order to make infrastructure and operational decisions. This decision-making capability is important as many facilities spend millions of dollars each year on improving sewer system function, yet are constrained by lack of quality data on sewer flows. Improved sewer flow data may help to optimize infrastructure improvements and reduce costs to taxpayers. In addition, this work may directly advance the health and welfare of the American public through improved wastewater collection systems operations and reduced overflows and basement backups. This technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to advance a novel, non-contact sensor that collects video of wastewater flow in sanitary sewer systems to measure flow rate and detect critical sewer events. Specifically, the technology collects video of sanitary sewer flows and processes it in real time using a machine learning algorithm to measure the velocity and water level of the flow. This technology also evaluates images of sewer flows to identify illicit discharges into the system. Several key technical hurdles crucial to successful commercialization of this innovation will be addressed in the proposed project, including the use of artificial illumination systems in closed pipe environments, the development of strategies to account for rapid variations in flow rates, and the development of data analytic methods to identify critical sewer events. Given these technical hurdles, the objectives of this project will be to develop a video-based flow sensor that can accurately capture velocity and water level under expected environmental conditions and to analyze data from the proposed sensor to accurately identify critical sewer events such as blockages and illicit discharges.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a visuospatial educational assessment tool.  Visuospatial aptitude is a facet of intelligence that underlies innovative thinking, i.e., how do new ideas emerge? and What are the physiological processes involved? Today, there is an overwhelming exposure within society to digital visual stimuli and national assessment authorities acknowledge visuospatial abstract reasoning as an accepted and sought after cognitive ability. Future curriculum designs must develop along with how people are changing and perceiving knowledge. This project seeks to set standards in education on visuospatial ability by introducing a novel assessment. This visuospatial assessment tool will utilize a software platform that allows customers to take the assessment online, and has commercial potential to improve industry, science, and educational programs for the advancement of human communication.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the development of an information technology consisting of a visuospatial ability assessment for measuring the biological processes that are required for being creative. Humans are biologically predisposed both to perceive and to reproduce symmetry, mainly in visual form, but also aurally; This proposed visuospatial assessment tool measures some of the biological processes that are required for the perception and reproduction of symmetry. Specifically, this assessment measures a form of sensorimotor perceptual action referred to in this project as ‘affective symmetry gauging’ (ASG). ASG consists of a subject’s innate visual perception/identification of the division in extreme and mean ratio point (DEMR; i.e., the symmetry point) in a given pattern. Because this process measures the extent to which a subject can perceive/identify and reproduce the symmetry point in given patterns, the tool also suggests the degree to which a subject may be inclined to reproduce symmetry, marking this inclination as a natural human expression of creativity aligned to pleasingness.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable one million Americans that suffer with the loss of ability to speak through disease of or damage to the larynx or mouth (aphonia). The inability to fluently communicate with other people has severe consequences. Voiceless individuals are three times more likely to suffer a preventable adverse event in medical settings than speaking patients, and this can lead to health problems and even life-threatening situations. Up to 50% of these adverse events could be avoided with adequate communication between patients and clinicians. The proposed solution is a video-to-speech software application that provides voiceless people with real-time communication assistance, especially geared towards medical settings. The technology could help prevent hundreds of thousands of adverse health events each year (costing $6.8 billion annually), with benefits for the voiceless population and the healthcare system in general. The innovation may improve voice restoration by providing real-time translation with no training needed and allowing complex messages to be expressed while looking eye-to-eye (an important part of human communication). Moreover, the technology does not require invasive installations nor complex equipment, is readily accessible, and has maintenance requirements that are marginal.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the intellectual challenge of overcoming the ambiguity of visemes when trying to automate lip-reading. Visemes (the gestures made when talking) and phonemes (the sounds produced with these gestures) do not share a one-to-one correspondence. This makes accurately predicting the intended speech based on visual information challenging. Previous researchers have failed to reach acceptable accuracy levels in the interpretation of visemes, while other tools only work with a few dozen words that must be structured according to pre-defined, fixed rules that are impractical. The main goal of this effort is to develop a combination of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network transducers that is capable of accurately differentiating visemes and permits real-time, reliable voice assistance for voiceless people. Project objectives include: (1) pre-training an algorithm to detect phonemes using publicly available speech video, (2) optimizing the phoneme-trained algorithm against healthcare relevant vocabulary, and (3) alpha-testing of the lip-reading algorithm against real-time speech.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic. Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep, insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10 Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an innovation in sleep therapy.  Approximately half of all American adolescents and young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression, and suicide.  The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively advance teenagers’ circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities. This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better sleep hygiene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its ability to use machine learning and wearable technology to reduce uncontrolled destructive episodees, known as meltdowns, in children with autism. Meltdowns are highly distressing events for these children and their families and may require intervention on behalf of emergency response personnel and healthcare providers. Treating individuals with autism by proactively detecting meltdowns will allow caregivers time to intervene, mitigate, and prevent the onset of destructive behavioral episodes. The ability to predict a meltdown, and then implement strategic intervention to prevent the meltdown, may have positive life-changing effects for the children, their families, and their caretakes by reducing social stigma, enabling more mainstreaming of school and family activities, and reducing significant financial healthcare burdens. This technology may also be used to mitigate panic attacks in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a wearable device that detects, predicts, and helps prevent meltdowns in children with autism. Wearable devices that measure physiological parameters are available in the market, but none of them are specific to autism, and none of them proactively predict behavior episodes. A unique feature of this wearable device is that it uses machine learning to predict meltdowns. Incorporating machine learning allows each device to learn the unique biometric signature of the wearer so it can predict meltdowns with high accuracy. When a child is at high risk for a meltdown, the device will detect the relevant physiology and alert caregivers and therapists in time to intervene. The objectives of this project are to create a prototype which includes the wearable product and the individualization enabled by machine learning to correlate a child’s biometric measures with behavioral states. The goal is to achieve decreased frequency and/or severity of meltdowns. By enabling caregivers of children with autism to take control of and prevent meltdowns, this project has the potential to eliminate the stigma these children face during a meltdown in public, and empowers the children to become more independent as they age.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help hospitals improve their sterile processing departments (SPD), where decontamination, sterilization, and assembly of medical equipment and devices occur. The company’s proposed solution seeks to enhance SPD technicians’ work performance and skill levels, decrease SPDs’ operating costs, reduce Hospital Associated Infections (HAI) and Surgical Site Infections (SSI), lessen expensive surgical delays, and reduce related healthcare service delivery costs. Sterile processing technicians play a critical role in preventing infection by sterilizing, cleaning, processing, assembling, storing, and distributing medical supplies. They are directly responsible for disinfection and sterilization of hospital instruments/devices. The team uses mixed reality designed to augment the day-to-day work responsibilities of SPD technicians while supporting the cost-effectiveness of operating a SPD. The solution’s digital content and holograms provide an immersive experience increasing competency, maximizing workflow, and boosting productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project incorporates three applications into augmented reality hardware to enhance the job performance of sterile processing department (SPD) technicians. The applications include barcode/radio frequency identification (RFID) reading, traceability and surgical instrument detection, and inspection utilizing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).  These applications are designed to provide efficient and accurate tracking, improved workflow, and increased worker productivity. The research goals of the project include creating a software application programming interface (API) capable of reading barcodes and RFID tags. By providing additional monitoring and tracking capabilities with automated data within the users' field of view and creating an application to enhance object detection capabilities, SPDs in hospitals, doctors' offices and at-home care locations can learn, in real time, the best practices for sterilization of infected surfaces to enable safer and healthier living and work spaces.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to engage citizen in environmental research activities, potentially increasing the selection of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers for youth. This project focuses on enhancing academic and industry partnerships around citizen science, improving science and environmental literacy, and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields of study. In addition to improving the nation’s scientific and technical workforce pipeline, the project seeks to employ a unique commercialization model for interactive educational media that allows for both authentic learning and widespread use by general audiences. This model mixes digital and in-person experiences, digital distribution methods, and mobile experience commercialization strategies that can serve as a model for other educational and commercial interactive media companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two critical issues: engaging more youth in environmental science and engineering education and increasing local environmental data for scientists. The project team will research and develop optimal methods and tools for creating educational and interactive media with rapid scientific data collection capabilities. For youth and educators, the project seeks to engage users in national standards-aligned scientific learning activities. The project will create hyperlocal networks that collect data and make results directly available to local communities so that they can actively track pressing environmental concerns such as migrations and changes in populations of species. The technical goals of the project include creating new processes for connecting local, crowdsourced user input to citizen science data repositories in a way that automates the categorization and validation of that data. The resulting project will actively engage youth in real scientific research and improve data collection for federal and university environmental science programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides virtual interfaces that can be dynamically customized to address the challenge of user adoption in augmented reality (AR) products. This project overcomes previous limitations for AR such as the lack of interoperability, user-acceptance, scalability, and application-aware user intent recognition. While the AR market is projected to grow, wearable collaboration has unexplored potential. Users empowered by this project may be able to easily collaborate alongside skilled experts as well as robotic interfaces in the same medium. Through contextually-aware dynamic controls, manufacturing businesses can lower the risk of human-error while increasing fulfillment capabilities, as employees working from home can stay physically connected and remain engaged with minimal compromise. The AR innovation proposed in this project has application across multiple industries, including manufacturing, training, and emergency simulations.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create a framework for scalable experimentation of virtual interfaces that empower users to search, tag, and store meaningful data using gesture interactions in a secure and private manner. This project seeks to provide context-based, hands-free interaction with wireless devices while minimizing the need to set up sensors (such as optical components or microphones) in controlled environments and providing visual feedback and accessibility to the end user. A wrist-worn wearable captures pre-trained gesture data, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses identifies and analyzes an object within the context of said gestures to control a mechatronic device, such as a robot, to perform occupational tasks. This dynamic process uses factors such as the user’s gaze area, physical location, and computer application.  The improvement upon gesture control may allow a separate visual unit, such as the AR glasses, to wirelessly receive and display the gesture intents and perform contextually-aware, meaningful interactions with a clear distinction across a plurality of devices or digitally tagged objects associated with a specific use-case.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is not limited to the higher education community, but has broader application at the elementary, middle and high school levels, especially in underserved and marginalized communities experiencing increased rates of suicide and mental health issues. This project's innovative technologies can assist in the mental health crisis in the country's youth, and specifically in the Native American health system as well as Juvenile Detainee/Juvenile Justice systems. This project's implementation of research based on the benefits of game-based intervention coupled with biometric sensing has the potential to provide the technologies necessary to equip the mental health profession to develop options that could replace pharmacological interventions with a path to delivering personalized and measurement-based mental health services.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses predictive algorithms, wearable technology and peripheral autonomic biofeedback to provide timely and effective data to enable mental health professionals to enact treatments and therapeutic support for students. Challenges in the increase of adult mental illness, shortage of mental health professionals and shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists require a move towards tele-psychiatry, collaborative care and innovative technology to bridge the gap between inadequate supply and increasing demand. The proposed approach involves the development of bio-behavioral technology that provides mental health professionals an interactive stress and anxiety evaluation to enable deep, transformative connections between young adults and mental health service providers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a technology that delivers low cost of energy from offshore wind and unlocks new markets inaccessible to current technology, e.g., small populations with smaller, locally-maintained turbines, deep water locations where conventional floaters are not economical, and regions lacking deep ports. If successful, the global impact may have the potential to suppress carbon emissions at the scale of gigaton carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent/year. The proposed technology is a floating wind turbine that may reduce 80% of the weight of a conventional floating turbine and makes it possible to fabricate more components locally, with domestic businesses and jobs. The newly proposed architecture will be tested to ensure it survives and operates well in the ocean environment. The crucial first step is to adapt the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) world-class wind-wave software to simulate the unusual motions of the system and demonstrate its viability. The end goal is the commercialization of a disruptive offshore wind turbine, developed in the U.S. and deployed globally, that can outcompete all of today’s designs, in a market estimated to soon reach ~$100 billion/year.

    This project seeks provide the intellectual foundation that leads to a first-of-its-kind class of offshore wind turbines that have minimal weight, that rides on top of the waves, taht expands deployability into regions inaccessible with current technology, and that increases mobility for installation / maintenance. Such a floating structure has never before been designed and this project may provide deep insight into several questions about the loading and motions that arise from a complex superposition of turbulent wind, random waves, ocean current, rotor elasticity and angular momentum, and dynamic blade pitch and generator control. This STTR proposal seeks to address a critical technical risk: adaptation of NREL’s simulator OpenFAST to characterize the unique motions of the system operating in a complex environment of loading from wave, wind and current and the resulting impacts on loading and power production. The proposed system departs from long-standing industry conventions that have relied on the design principle of limiting system motions. The results of the simulator may be used to refine the system design and then demonstrate that it's dynamic behavior complies with the design load cases required for certification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the affordable and energy-efficient design of advanced powered lift aircraft, creating aircraft capable of transporting people and things to new locations. The reduction in transport cost and emissions made possible by this project may ensure that the advanced air mobility market, expected to grow to $120 Billion by 2030, develops community-compatible, economically- and socially-relevant mobility capabilities. The fundamental aerodynamic technology developed by this project may be applicable to a wide range of aircraft sizes and missions, enabling new capability in defense, public safety, and humanitarian roles as well as improving the quality of life for the public by enabling affordable, advanced mobility and logistics in urban, suburban, and underserved rural areas. The increased efficiency of the technology may enable these benefits to be realized while reducing the environmental impacts.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to confirm the feasibility of a new method of distributed electric propulsion for lift augmentation that combines high lift for low-speed performance with low drag, cruise-efficient wing design using a novel integrated propulsor. The project will explore the  complex and incompletely understood aerodynamic interaction of a propeller and wing, which is key to technical and commercial success. The technical objectives include: characterizing the slipstream influence on the wing pressure distribution and boundary layer characteristics, the influence of variations in propeller and wing configuration and location on high lift performance, and the aircraft level effects and tradeoffs of the configuration. The project seeks to meet these technical objectives with a combination of experimental wind tunnel research and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and analyses to thoroughly understand and characterize the complex flow physics and their impacts on aircraft performance and design. The effort may advance the propeller-wing interaction aerodynamics field.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the all-around strength of three dimentional (3D)-printed polymer objects, which will make such objects more useful for structurally-stressed prototypes and manufactured products (including prototypes and products that are physically large).  The prposed strength gains are expected from embedding continuous carbon-fiber filaments in multiple directions within the body of a 3D-print. Designers and engineers seek to tailor internal carbon-fiber arrangements to suit their specific needs. The resulting carbon-fiber-reinforced objects (as with 3D-printed objects in general) may be produced without the expensive and/or time-consuming use of molds, tooling, or specialized hand-labor.  By facilitating the cost-effective production of strong, plastics-based custom and low-volume manufactured products, this project seeks accelerate product development, foster entrepreneurship, and encourage manufacturing endeavors within the United States by making it easier to turn imagined concepts into strong, functional objects in the physical world.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a process for embedding continuous, layer-crossing, carbon-fiber filaments within the body of a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D print in order to provide tensile and shear reinforcement along planes orthogonal to the 3D printed layer. The goal of the research is to employ quasi-parallel filaments oriented orthogonal to 3D print layers, reducing the interlayer weakness and resultant structural anisotropy characteristic of FDM prints.  The project will further examine the use of more complex filament arrangements to provide selective reinforcement in directions and along paths specified by a product designer.  The overall strength, stiffness, and toughness will be assessed adn compared to conventionally-manufactured engineering plastics.  The embedding process, which will take place simultaneously with the layer-by-layer creation of the print, will be achieved by combining the actions of FDM printer nozzles with those of automated robotic filament manipulators.  The project will examine the geometric range of printed parts and components that incorporate reinforcing filaments, with initial goal of printing reinforced shell-like objects that continuously curve along multiple axes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.

    The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber – designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.

    The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used in a variety of settings, including doctors’ offices, physical therapy offices, and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of $1.7 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is creating a tool for police officers and other service members who are expected to perform their job duties under high stress.  This Phase 1 project seeks to develop a technology that creates stress scores and alerts users when they are in “red zones” for decision making based on physiological monitoring via a wearable sensor unit. The initial target market segment for this technology is the ~$1 billion law enforcement market as there is a high need for tools that can help de-escalate situations and potentially improve the use-of-force decisions. The pain points of acute stress impacting decision-making have been validated in military and professional athletic markets as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wearable technology that uses skin conductivity to measure stress and alert users via vibrational feedback. This Phase 1 project proposes to: (1) run a pilot study on police officers to collect skin conductance data during scenario training, (2) build machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) models with a high predictive accuracy of poor decision making using this data, (3) determine ideal sensor location and build a custom wearable strap attachment, (4) develop the mobile application to build a data visualization interface for officers and trainers, and (5) test the effectiveness of delivering vibrational feedback during decision making of officers using the prototype. The successful conclusion of Phase 1 may lead to a hardware-software prototype that measures the police officers' emotional stress using a skin conductance signal, then alerts the user via vibrational feedback when they are in a heightened level of stress.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, “green”, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the productivity and safety of operations across the entire $1.3 trillion Blue Economy. Maritime operations routinely involve significant risks to human life and property and consequently bear extraordinarily high operating costs. Autonomous ocean vehicles (falling under the Robotics technology area) are being rapidly adopted by science, commercial, and defense organizations due to their potential to dramatically reduce cost and risk. The success of the proposed project will advance the state of the art for commercial autonomous vehicle compliance with international laws regulating interactions between maritime vessels at sea. Giving autonomous ocean vehicles the ability to interact with crewed vessels safely and predictably will accelerate the adoption of these tools and the missions they enable. Several specific market segments stand to benefit immediately from the proposed technology, including the $31B offshore wind market, the $2B port automation market, the $233B aquaculture market, and dozens of others. Beyond market impacts, humanity needs ocean data to understand the critical dangers of overfishing and climate change.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the design of systems and software needed for autonomous ocean vehicles to comply with the international collision regulations (COLREGS) for maritime vehicles. The difficulty the industry has faced in creating COLREGS compliant autonomy is the fact that the rules were developed with the expectation that experienced mariners would be able to make qualitative interpretations in unique situations. That led to a descriptive rather than prescriptive set of rules that is good for human mariners, but difficult to implement in software. The objectives of this Phase I project include the design and simulation of autonomous systems able to operate in compliance with the COLREGS. In addition to simulations, the software may be deployed to small autonomous surface vehicles for preliminary on-water testing. Anticipated results include a system able to maintain COLREGS compliance within a documented envelope of conditions. The effective implementation of safe system design, optimized control, and machine learning techniques can combine to produce the first autonomous ocean vehicles that can be trusted in congested waterway settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to produce a high performance, low power, electronic chemical sensor system that does not require a radioactive ionization source. Achieving a low cost, non-radioactive Internet of Things (IoT) systems for chemical sensing in a more distributed and connected network has potentially far reaching implications in many industries. Creating an IoT network of sensors to safely monitor chemical signatures on a large and distributed scale, in real-time, may provide new analytical-quality chemical sensing capabilities. Sensor applications may range from engineering (monitoring fermentations) and to health care (diagnostics), to environmental monitoring (air quality) and defense and security (hazard detection) or agriculture (waste mitigation). The chemical sampling and sensor platform has the potential to be integrated with cell phones and autonomous systems. The market for personal use devices could be substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to establish an experimental and theoretical framework to optimize Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) for analytical quality chemical identification. There are many types of chemical sensors that have been commercialized but no high-quality systems meet the performance, safety, and cost constraints required to be a successfully linked in an IoT system. The fundamental physics and commercial utility of DMS is well established, so it is a leading candidate for this use. The foundation of the system is a miniaturized DMS. Because the microchip operates on lithium ion polymer batteries, it has the potential for widely dispersed IoT-linked chemical sensing but the reliance on radioactive isotopes for chemical ionization is a critical barrier to adoption that limits commercial applications. This technical barrier may be overcome by combining a non-radioactive, plasma-based method of chemical ionization. The experimental results will be used to validate custom software to simulate performance of this complex system. If the performance of the combined system can be successfully modeled, it can be further miniaturized and optimized. The detection of natural gas odorants and selected food and flavor compounds have been selected as initial proof-of-concept commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to facilitate ocean data collection. Understanding the oceans is important for climate research, naval operations, maritime domain awareness, and ecosystem preservation, yet traditional data collection methods using research ships, commercial vessels, and buoys are cumbersome, expensive, and  limited in their scope of discovery. While satellites have enabled remote data collection, they are affected by weather and limited in the types of data they collect. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) - robotic boats - are promising, but even today’s smallest oceangoing USVs are too costly for many applications. Thus, many regions of Earth’s oceans are rarely studied. The technology developed here aims to meet this need by enabling low-cost deployment of sensor-equipped robotic fleets. Better access to ocean data may improve understanding of the ocean and its resources, leading to better climate modeling, improved safety, economic gains, and more effective regulations. Further, ocean monitoring and surveillance is key to understanding ocean water quality, identifying contaminants, and devising strategies to prevent future contamination and pollution of the ocean’s waters. Ultimately, cost-effective oceanic data collection may help sustain and grow the ocean economy.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a small, low-cost, autonomous robotic sailboat that uses an innovative sail arrangement and weather-optimized navigation system. With a combination of affordability and utility, the technology represents a new approach for widespread oceanic data collection. This technology can be deployed virtually anywhere in the ocean, can be small (2 meters or less), and is 100% wind- and solar-powered. The research in this project seeks to further this technology by advancing two innovations: passive directional stability and weather-optimized navigation. Unlike most other robotic sailboats, the proposed USV does not need active steering to hold a course, once set. Further, the proposed USV has a navigation system that exploits the spatial and temporal variance in the weather and uses local weather data to direct the boats to navigate more efficiently. This STTR proposal seeks to address areas of high technical risk including stability of the steering system under various wind and water conditions, resistance to traveling excessively downwind during storms, effectiveness of the optimized navigation system in both actual and simulated weather conditions at locations worldwide, construction and performance of prototypes in lakes and oceans, and long-term resistance to marine environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.  Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks to  disrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop the first universal method for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of all main bodily fluids in biological stains revealed at a crime, overcoming the limitations of standard biochemical tests when identifying biological stains. The proposed technology will allow for rapid, accurate and nondestructive identification of, and distinction between, biological stains that supports the possibility of linking DNA to a bodily fluid type, thus increasing the efficiency of crime labs and assisting law enforcement personnel in the identification of suspected criminals. Commercially, this technology will be of use to the 600+ Crime Investigation Labs and 19,000+ crime scene investigators within the U.S. Department of Justice. The new approach has the potential to reduce the backlog of unprocessed DNA samples in crime labs across the U.S., while providing data that can improve the efficiency of evidence analyses.

    This analysis platform has the potential to significantly advance the field of crime scene analysis by replacing single body fluid-specific chemical tests, that are inaccurate and destructive in nature, with software that offers the novel ability to positively identify all bodily fluids in order to generate real-time decisions regarding sample content and further analyses.  The project will establish proof-of-principle through the optimization of a Raman spectroscopy method for a desktop instrument while further developing software for realistic body fluid sampling. This will allow for the development of a working prototype for crime laboratory usage.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance artificial integration of genetic information (genetic payloads) into the genomes of animal cells, microorganisms, and plants. A novel class of molecular vehicles (DNA donors) allows an unprecedented efficiency in delivering genetic payloads when combined with the established CRISPR (clustered short interspaced palindromic repeats) system for gene editing and genome engineering. The new payload delivery technology is expected to enable many emergent and innovative applications. This technology provides a safer alternative to the state-of-the-art method at lower cost. Non-therapeutic applications will enable the efficient generation of cell lines and transgenic animals. In plant biotechnology, the new DNA donors will allow complex genetic engineering with only one round of genome modification, improving crop yields and agricultural production.

    The proposed project provides a key innovation to the DNA donors that are used for transferring genetic payloads for targeted integration via CRISPR. Whereas CRISPR-mediated gene disruption (knock-out) is very efficient, integration of transfected DNA donors for targeted integration (knock-in) is generally limited. Existing commercial solutions are focused on small gene-sized payloads, but an innovative solution that enables the integration of larger payloads carrying several genes or entire genetic circuits is critically needed. The work in this proposal will demonstrate the broad applicability of the gene transfer and editing technology in a subset of therapeutically relevant cell types, such as stem cells and primary immune cells. The performance of the novel donor vehicles will be assessed by comparing their integration efficiency and precision of integration and cell toxicity to conventional DNA donor molecules and virus-based delivery systems. In addition, the project will demonstrate the ability to produce large quantities of the new DNA donors, thus greatly facilitating their application in cell therapies and dramatically reducing their overall cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project is the creation of a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost, semi-automatic. ultra-high-altitude balloon system for suborbital transportation system. The technology seeks to provide routine sub-orbital atmospheric flights for environmental testing of payloads in the ultra-low vacuum of the Mesosphere (260,000 feet).  The technology also seeks to transport metrological payloads, such as radiosondes (that measures pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) and rawinsondes (that evaluate wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) at all altitudes from the ground to 260,000 feet for extended periods of time. This capability is especially critical for increasing the success rate of space missions. The new testing capability may save the space industry hundreds of million dollars in technology failures annually. The transportation of metrological payloads to the upper extremes of the atmosphere for extended periods of time may also provide improved accuracy of weather forecasts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to solve well-known problems that prevent balloons from taking payloads to the upper atmosphere. This project will develop hardware prototypes, perform software development, and integrate the hardware and software together.  The team will perform flight demonstrations to characterize the impact of the Mesospheric environment on the ballooning flight transport and demonstrate the low-cost payload transport to the Mesospheric sub-orbital altitudes for a long duration (> hour).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate the adoption of error correction technologies in the quantum computing industry.  It is widely held that quantum error correction will be critical to realize the potential of universal quantum computing.  An error-corrected quantum computer holds promise for making transformational discoveries in science and engineering that will have broad impact across traditional technology sectors. By developing resource-efficient quantum error correction design and decoding software tools, this Phase I project aims to hasten the era of error-corrected quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new method for error syndrome extraction from a register of data qubits during the execution of an error-corrected quantum algorithm. In contrast to the standard approach to syndrome extraction, where each quantum codeword is treated independently, this new approach extracts error information from the entire quantum computer collectively.  The algorithmic and cost advantage of the proposed approach is a reduction in the number of extra qubits required for error syndrome extraction. This project will focus on reducing the density of the quantum circuits used for syndrome extraction according to the new approach. Low-density quantum circuits are critical for robust quantum error correction since syndrome extraction is mediated by two-qubit entangling gates, which often have error rates higher than idling or memory errors occurring in the data qubits. Another objective of this Phase I project is to design low-density error correcting codes that promote locality in syndrome extraction. Local syndrome extraction is important for error correction in quantum processors that support limited connectivity between qubits. A final objective is to benchmark the proposed constructions and algorithms on simulated data and perform proof-of-concept experimental validation on cloud-based quantum computers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, which affects about one in eight men and is the second deadliest cancer among men. The current process for diagnosing prostate cancer is imprecise and commonly involves multiple rounds of increasingly invasive, uncomfortable, and expensive diagnostic tests. The medical technology proposed in this project will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging tests (MRIs) performed to confirm diagnosis, and enable improved ongoing monitoring of suspected or recovered prostate cancer patients. The proposed device will help hospitals save valuable time and decrease overall costs of care. The device will be designed to address the specific needs of clinicians to accurately diagnose prostate cancer cases at an earlier point in the diagnostic workflow, at a lower cost to health systems. Additionally, the technology will be developed with a focus on cost effectiveness, to ensure increased prostate cancer diagnostic capabilities are accessible even in low-resource settings, such as rural communities and low- and middle-income countries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a prototype of a new medical device that uses photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and novel acoustic lens technology to aid in detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Existing early testing options, such as digital rectal exams, prostate-specific antigen tests, and transrectal ultrasounds, are often inconclusive. The PAI endoscopic probe device proposed in this project will offer hospitals and clinicians a new method for visualizing potentially cancerous prostate tissues, with higher imaging contrast and resolution than existing diagnostics. It will also offer an alternative to other testing methods with known deficiencies that often result in misdiagnosis or missed cases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a biosensing technology that may enable highly sensitive, quantitative, point-of-care diagnostics. Once validated, the proposed biosensor, disposable sensor chips/cartridges, and electronic readout modules can be readily mass-produced using existing medical device manufacturing capacities. The technology may have an impact on the health and welfare of patients. The immediate goal is to examine interleukin protein monitoring for early detection of cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening health complication that develops in patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment, organ transplant, infectious disease, sepsis, etc. Additional applications include early detection of cancers or cancer recurrence, dry eye disease, existing and emerging infectious disease, biothreats, etc.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a proof-of-concept demonstration of a low-cost, magnetic biosensor technology that may enable analytical laboratory capabilities for reliable biomarker detection and quantitation at the point of care. The proposed biosensor will be adapted for quantitative detection of interleukin proteins in blood for early diagnostics of cytokine release syndrome. The technology integrates magnetic sensing into the ubiquitous lateral flow assay (LFA) format (used in pregnancy tests) utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as reporters of biomolecular interactions. The tests are well-suited for point-of-care applications where rapid and convenient access to low-cost diagnostic tools helps improve patient care. The rationale for this project is that the proposed biosensors can provide clinically-relevant quantitative data rivaling those of state-of-the-art laboratories while preserving the advantages of LFA tests in terms of low cost and ease of use. The disposable chip with its clam-shell design builds upon the usual LFA cassette design. The disposable chip will be produced and assembled from low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and is expected to add only cents to the cost of an LFA test. A low-cost portable reader capable of ultrahigh sensitivity quantitative readings will be built from conventional off-the-shelve electronic components.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project on a handheld simultaneous translator advances the state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning acceleration. Beyond technical contributions, the novel translator will likely have a significant impact on a wide range of domains, such as military personnel deployed in foreign countries, businesspeople participating in multilingual meetings, medical service providers, law enforcement, customer support services, diplomats and political representatives, local governmental entities providing services to citizens in the preferred language, and international tourists. As such, the project will have broader impacts in increasing economic competitiveness, advancing health and welfare, and improving military capabilities of the United State. Furthermore, the project helps to enhance equity in education and STEM literacy by enabling better access to educational resources to people of diverse backgrounds, especially immigrants, women, and underrepresented minorities in some countries/regions, who were previously disadvantaged due to limited prior educational access or limited access to foreign language courses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the research and development of innovative algorithmic optimizations and a purpose-built translation device to enable fast, accurate and low-power inference for simultaneous translation. The overall approach is to exploit the unspoken but implied connections among language elements at various levels to guide the learning model. Specific techniques are investigated at the phoneme-level, work-level, and sentence-level. Collectively, these innovations aim to reduce the computation complexity of simultaneous translation by orders of magnitude while increasing translation accuracy. A systematic and comprehensive methodology is also being established that allows fast implementation of the inference hardware via high-level synthesis and reports detailed statistics on translation accuracy, latency, power, and area to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the research.

    \ Research (SBIR) project is the development of novel sunscreens and UV-protective\
    \ products that are safer for both humans and the environment. Sunscreen protects\
    \ the skin by absorbing or reflecting the sun’s harmful UV rays,preventing premature\
    \ skin aging, painful burns, and skin cancer, which is the most common form of\
    \ cancer in the U.S., and results in treatment costs reaching $3.3 billion annually.\
    \ UV-filtering active ingredients in sunscreens have been under scrutiny because\
    \ of the safety risks they pose to humans and the environment. Current UV filters\
    \ can be absorbed by the skin, cause hormone disruption, and persist and accumulate\
    \ in the environment, where they can harm wildlife and disrupt marine ecosystems.\
    \ This project will advance the development of novel sunscreens and UV filters\
    \ composed of naturally occurring, food-safe peptides containing UV-absorbing\
    \ amino acids. These compounds are photo-stable, biodegradable, non-absorbing,\
    \ and safe for both humans and the environment, and they will have high impact\
    \ in the fields of skin care and biosafe food packaging. Because they can be produced\
    \ at relatively low cost, they also have the potential to take a considerable\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide a significant improvement in economic incentives for water rights holders to conserve and efficiently deploy their water. One of the greatest struggles facing the Western States is the disincentive for water rights holders to efficiently manage their water. If holders don’t use the entirety of their water each year, they risk losing the unused portion back to the State. Commercially, despite a billion-dollar demand for seasonal leasing of water—which would satisfy annual use requirements—water holders have no place and little ability to market and lease their unused water. This approach using the proposed distributed ledger technology (DLT), allows holders to track and log their water rights information on its platform. In turn, water users will finally have access to information that traditionally informs other property transactions—title history, water usage, comparable transactions, and localized pricing. With that information, our customers populate a marketplace where short-term and long-term transactions can be quickly and easily transacted. In sum, by creating the tools and interfaces to digitize water rights and enable simple-to-execute water transactions, DLT will power water markets and drive efficient water use throughout the West.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and develop a unique combination of distributed ledger (DL) tokenization and a decentralized distributed file system (DDFS) to produce a robust digital twin of both physical water rights and usage, as well as the associated legal materials and data. DL tokens represent the legal quantity of water that has been granted to the user by the government. DDFS allows the storage of key information pertaining to the water rights—including title and use history—in a public, immutable manner, anchored in the DL transactions. This approach provides a level of trust, transparency and provenance for water that is currently absent in the United States. The current state of the market—makes it impossible for the average water owner and manager to have any insight into the value of their water assets. Water-specific marketplaces backed by DL and DDFS allow both buyers and sellers the ability to view, vet, and transact water assets efficiently and with minimal cost. This first phase of research and development will establish the requisite infrastructure to populate those marketplaces.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to promote increased recycling and to enable the upcycling of two of the most common polymers found in mixed waste streams: polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). While plastic recycling can assist in mitigating the vast and continuously growing volume of plastic waste, mixed plastic streams—notably those with PE and iPP—introduce many challenges.  These polymers are immiscible but of similar density, making them unsuitable for simple melt-blending yet difficult to separate. Although additives have been developed to overcome the immiscibility issue, these additives typically need to be added at high loadings and produce resins with poor mechanical properties. This project focuses on the development of advanced additives (compatibilizers) that can be introduced in low concentrations to produce PE/iPP resins with superior durability, ductility, and industrial utility that rivals or outperforms homopolymers. Such a technology has the potential to bring superior efficiency to the mixed recycling process, advancing the field toward a more circular plastics economy. By delivering high-value products from waste streams, widespread adoption of this technology would drive improvements in plastic waste collection, recycling, and re-manufacturing, supporting jobs in these and adjacent fields.

    This project involves the creation of non-reactive, multi-graft copolymers capable of supporting high-quality iPP/PE blends with superior tensile strength characteristics, impact resistance, and rigidity compared to current resins. The proposed approach leverages interlocked molecular entanglements and co-crystallization to provide stronger adhesion to iPP and PE. This technology seeks capability of up to 30% iPP contamination in PE using as little as 1 wt% additive to generate high-value blended materials. Phase I development will involve: 1) optimization of polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymer compatibilization additives, 2) scale-up of optimized polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymers, 3) testing of larger scale batches for end polymer qualities, and 4) testing of compatibilizers with combinations of different grades of actual post-consumer plastic waste. The technology may contribute to an enhanced understanding of how specific copolymer architectures influence compatibilization efficiency, while also meeting the need for technologies to support compatibilization of PE and iPP for blended recycling applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is based on the improvement of respiratory equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE). Commercially available face masks, gowns, filter media and other PPE are contaminated through environmental exposure, posing a threat to healthcare personnel.  The proposed solution is a high-surface-area antiviral/antimicrobial micropowder which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Improved protection from infections and reduced cross-contamination may result in fewer deaths, decreased healthcare costs, and increased economic productivity. The addressable global PPE market was $23 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow through 2028, while the global disposable face mask market was valued at $792 million in 2019, and the inclusion of other types of PPE increases this estimate further. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving the demand for these products, though the applicability of the proposed technology is not limited to COVID-19. The proposed product will be material that can modify the surfaces of fabrics with active antiviral properties, leading to improvements in health and safety. The customer base is expected to be healthcare personnel, pharmaceutical and food manufacturing facilities, the public, and manufacturers of PPE, medical devices, textiles, and filters.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to improve the antiviral/antimicrobial properties of respiratory equipment and PPE, which is typically only passively protective, is difficult to decontaminate and re-use, and can lead to worker exposure during changing and handling. The proposed solution is a high-surface-area micropowder, coated with an antiviral/antimicrobial coating, which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Unlike current technologies, the particle size, morphology, surface area, and topography can all be tailored for specific biocidal activity. Additionally, powder shape and surface quality can be customized to enhance adhesion. The proposed project is to develop a prototype powder product formulation that allows easy application of antiviral (copper alloy) coated particles to fabrics and other materials. This technology is based on a fluidized-bed, plasma-enhanced deposition process for synthesizing unique core-shell micropowders of metal, ceramic, or highly-shaped nanoforms of carbon, including proven biocidal materials. The synthesized microparticles will have high surface-to-weight ratios making them better suited for capturing micro-organisms while also having improved bonding to surfaces of filter media and PPE materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the foundation of a fractional-calculus-based computational platform for the simulation of multiscale and multiphysics systems. This Phase I effort will focus on developing modeling capabilities for nonlinear thermomechanical fatigue and damage behavior of ductile materials and will provide important insights on both feasibility and performance of the fractional calculus approach for a class of nonlinear problems that is not only of extreme importance for scientific and industrial applications but it is also a prototypical example of multiscale and multiphysics systems.
    By leveraging an advanced and generalized class of operators, namely the distributed and variable-order fractional operators, this project will develop fatigue and damage mechanics simulation software capable of continuum scale computational efficiency and microscale accuracy. The resulting formulation will offer an unprecedented combination of computational efficiency, a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, and a revolutionary adaptive mathematical structure that evolves in real-time based on the underlying physics controlling the deterioration and damage process.

    The overarching innovation at the basis of the M3SIM software products is a one-of-its-kind computational platform based on cutting-edge distributed-variable order (DVO) fractional calculus (FC). The unique nature of DVO operators allows the new platform to perform multiscale and multiphysics analyses of complex systems at a level of accuracy and efficiency that is unattainable with traditional methods. This new approach will have profound practical implications for predictive science because it will enable a novel concept of an adaptive computational platform whose structure evolves with the underlying physics without a priori and ad hoc decisions from the user.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the company’s novel fire detection principle and the use of soft computing techniques by means of (1) computational experiments, and (2) a wide range of real fire and nuisance experiments on the company’s fire detector prototypes. This will allow the company to resolve any technical hurdles that may arise from the integration of the software and hardware into a minimum viable fire detector expected to significantly outperform current market solutions. The company has utilized real-world datasets of fire and nuisance experiments conducted by NIST to test and benchmark the innovation. Using temperature data, for example, the company’s algorithm detected fires up to 10 times faster than current technology (fixed-threshold). In addition, no missed detection occurred, and no false alarms were triggered in all NIST experiments. While these results are impressive, they are not sufficient to commercialize the innovation given that they are based on 69 experiments only. The activities proposed in phase I are designed to reduce the technical risk and strengthen the confidence in the company’s technology prior to commercialization. This is especially important because of the high regulatory burden and associated liabilities in the fire detection space.

    By leveraging ML, erli.ai’s patent-pending technology will process streaming data from heat/smoke sensors to detect the earliest signs of fire and separate fire and nuisance events. We introduce a new alarm triggering principle rooted in the temporal analysis of sensor data instead of the existing fixed-threshold approach. We propose to further develop our computational architecture, which employs deep Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and a variational autoencoder, by developing a theoretical basis for the outstanding performance our algorithm produced. We will develop an anomaly detection evaluation scheme for time streaming clustering using Dynamic Time Warping and Similarity Matrix technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major fundamental knowledge gaps underpinning the ability to create accurate flood maps. This proposal will advance new knowledge on the use of advanced analytics for the estimation of floods, thus transforming the tools available to respond and plan for flooding. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that building-scale flood detection will be achieved through a combination of existing sensors and advanced analytics. This SBIR project will research and develop data-driven flood maps to support targeted flood response and long-term infrastructure planning. Using advanced analytics, existing sensor data will be spatially distributed to create real-time flood maps. The method will be validated using a highly dense sensor network in the Great Lakes region. The technical results of this project will yield unprecedented insights and measurements of uncertainty related to flood estimation at urban scales. The resulting real-time flood maps will allow stormwater managers to stay ahead of resident complaints, while saving lives and property by sending their crews to the most important locations. Improved flood maps will also allow stormwater managers to maximize the impact of long-term infrastructure investments.

    The project's goal is to make all communities resilient to floods and climate change. To that end, this proposal will show how advanced analytics, driven by wireless sensing, will transform the ability of first responders to save lives, while helping stormwater managers maximize long-term infrastructure investments. The key innovation of this proposal is a data methodology, which will convert raw, spatially distributed sensor data into actionable, real-time flood maps. This data-driven technique will enable the first of its kind tool to detect floods at the scale of individual buildings, without requiring a sensor at every location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) “always-on” toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power “always-on” IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be transformational to multiple markets that require energy storage. High-energy densities will be enabled by the proposed advanced polymer separators. Potential customers for the new battery separator include battery manufacturers for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, space and military, small wearable devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), drones, consumer electronics, as well as automotive manufacturers in the mass mobility market. Adoption will be driven by the huge demand for electric vehicle batteries that are cheaper, lighter, safer and allow for longer drive ranges and reduced charge time. There are multiple ways in which consumers and society will benefit from the batteries enabled by this novel solid-state separator; from electric cars, to flying taxis; from more efficient energy storage grids to more reliable space vehicles; from lighter wearable devices to long lasting medical implants. In the long-term, the successful development of low-cost, fast-charging, high-density, long-life, and safe batteries enabled by the company’s new separator will reduce fossil fuel dependency and drive the electrification of the transportation sector and the transition towards greener energy solutions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an advanced polymer separator for novel hybrid solid/liquid battery cells which will dramatically improve performance of state-of-the-art solid-state batteries, enabling higher energy density, faster charging rate and enhanced safety over commercial Lithium-ion batteries. The new separator will be constructed from a novel polymer material whose feasibility has been validated at laboratory level. Stability tests showed higher conductivity and stability than currently available options. Compatibility with high-voltage cathodes was also demonstrated in preliminary studies. The goals of the project are (1) to develop a solid electrolyte which has an ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes that are currently used in the Li-ion batteries and (2) a scalable solid separator (using the above electrolyte) that is compatible with high-voltage cathodes (4 – 6 V). Main technical hurdles to overcome for successful commercialization are developing blade-cast-worthy slurries and scaling up the separator to a cell-size free-standing sheet. The former will be achieved by tuning the composition of the slurry to improve solubility; the latter will be achieved by improving the molecular weight of the polymer and blending and mixing it with ceramic oxide.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to make the gathering of tree measurements and other field-based nature observations dramatically easier. The project involves building a mobile app that uses computer vision and augmented reality to make measuring trees much easier than using the tape measures of today, in fact it will be as simple as scanning a barcode. This will result in much more nature imagery and other training data for use with ecological models, which will yield a better understanding of how ecosystems will change in the coming years. One important prediction this project will help with is forest growth which is very useful for generating carbon offsets that can finance the regeneration of large amounts of land. Better ecological models can also help communities prepare for changes in climate, sea level, soil quality and other ecological shifts in the coming decades. Millions of people will be potentially affected by climate change and its accompanying shifts in ecosystems, so arming communities and governments with better insights about these impacts will be critical. Furthermore, catalyzing many millions of hectares of nature regeneration projects will help mitigate the worst effects of climate change and other ecological challenges.


    This project involves the unique combination of computer vision with augmented reality in order to quickly and accurately measure trees. There are multiple computer vision neural networks being developed for the app. One of them uses bark and tree imagery in order to classify the tree species, an important feature needed for ecological models. Another model analyzes surrounding scenery and quickly identifies the closest tree trunk. The app then uses the phone’s augmented reality capabilities to gauge the distance and orientation of the phone from the trunk and combines these two to yield a diameter at breast height measurement. The research plan involves collecting data from specific regions in Panama and Brazil in conjunction with active nature restoration projects and gathering a critical mass of leaf and bark imagery so that species in those areas can be classified accurately. The scope will then increase to additional regions and later, measurements such as birdsong and other biodiversity markers. Over time the app could become a platform for many such nature observations, and it is expected to evolve to become more game-like to attract large numbers of people having fun experiences together and advancing the cause of nature science.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a novel method of drying agricultural products that is more energy efficient than current commercial devices and preserves the nutritional value of the dried products. This project is based upon  fast dehydration of wet biomass using desiccants comprised of particles of a certain size and arrangement. According to preliminary trials, this method may be 10 times more energy efficient than other drying methods. This project will produce a reusable particle filter that can be used to efficiently dehydrate food and agricultural products. This drying method can preserve nutritional value within the US food system while simultaneously reducing production costs, make agricultural industries more economically viable, and be easily powered by renewable energy sources thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption within the food industry.

    The technical innovation of this STTR Phase I project is the development of efficient and effective drying methods for agricultural products.  The technology is based on the incorporation of zeolite particles onto a substrate while maintaining their porosity. In order to achieve rapid dehydration of wet matter, the zeolite must be small in size and supported on a substrate so that its surface retains functionality. This methodology requires careful chemical synthesis. The key research goals are to conjugate or physically bind zeolite particles to a porous substrate, maintain the accessible surface area of the zeolite, and create a new material that can endure many cycles of brief low-power microwave heating to accomplish dehydration. In this project, several approaches will be investigated, starting with the synthesis of porous substrates, then modifying the surface to contain a controlled number of chemical functional groups, and then coating the substrate with zeolite using covalent linkages. In addition to covalent monolayer linkages, the project will also aim to optimize substrate coverage using other binding mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will provide the medical field with a broad response detector capable of pairing with cheaper disease diagnostic tools for improved healthcare.  Currently, there is not a commercially available broadband detector that can capture visible light and near infrared light.  The Phase I SBIR effort will lead to an advanced detector capable of spanning this light range and fulfilling this unmet need.  As a commercial product, this detector can be used in multiple commercial sectors including unmanned vehicles, the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.  For example, in the medical field the ideal light for tissue penetration is between visible and near infrared.  The detector developed in this project would permit optical scans of human bodies for disease diagnosis.  The optical scan will provide a cheaper and safer alternative in comparison to expensive MRI technology and high-energy sources, such as x-rays, that result in radiological exposure.  The size of the global medical imaging market is currently valued at $16 billion and the proposed work would help healthcare services in rural areas have access to optical diagnosing services.

    Semiconductor-based detectors are limited to absorbing photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the electronic band gap of the semiconductor.  As a result, there is not a commercially available detector that can span 400-2200nm with fast detection.  The expected outcome of this project is a single broadband detector, based off of the quantum spin Seebeck effect to generate a spin current, that can span 400-2200nm with a flat quantum efficiency and a high response time.  The quantum efficiency (QE) of the patent-protected detector is almost three orders of magnitude lower than semiconductor-based detectors and the largest portion of the project is devoted to improving the QE to commercial levels.  The project will accomplish the following goals: 1) prove the feasibility of increasing the quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, 2) make a readout circuit board, 3) show detector capabilities through building a benchtop-working prototype, and 4) design a compact prototype to be built during Phase II. As a commercial product, this detector can be used in unmanned vehicles, in the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF’s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.

    This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will help address the major concerns of climate change and sustainability of arable lands. The two common methods of weed control in the agricultural industry, herbicides and soil tillage, have a negative impact on the environment and soil sustainability. The health of the microbial environment in the soil is degraded by the use of herbicides and soil tillage. In addition, soil tillage exposes the organic matter in the soil to oxidation releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goal for reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate is to sequester the carbon in the soil and not release it. At this time, the only option for weed control of mid to late stage weeds without the use of herbicides or soil tillage is manual labor, which is more expensive. The successful development and testing of the precision weeder extraction tool will give the agricultural industry an automated and cost effective option for addressing weed control while helping to reduce the carbon emission from the soil and protect soil sustainability.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector extraction tool that can remove weeds without using chemicals or soil tillage. Advances in machine vision have made it possible to identify the individual plants in a field and determine which plant is the crop and which one is the weed. Presently, the two predominant methods used by automated weeders to kill the weeds is either by a targeted herbicide spray or soil tillage. Both of these methods negatively impact the environment and soil health. The proposed precision weeder will extract and dispose of the weeds without damage to the soil or environment. The economics of weeding will require the device to be simple, cost effective, reliable, and field hardened. Design and development of the extraction tool will use a new and novel method for removing the weeds with advances in design and actuation. The extraction tool will be tested in the field to determine its feasibility. Successful field trials will convince the customer and investor that this is a viable option for commercial automated weeding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is its innovative and potentially transformative contribution to assistive technologies for infants with motor impairment. In the United States, over 40,000 infants per year are born with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down syndrome, that often result in motor impairment. There is currently no device that provides independent movement to infants with motor limitations. Since children learn a great deal about their physical and social environments when they begin to crawl/walk, conditions that deny or delay independent movement can impact cognitive, language, and social development. A device that will let these infants move and explore at the same age as other children could mitigate these developmental delays and facilitate full integration into society.  Lifetime cost of healthcare for these children has been estimated at $250,000. Providing early independent movement could result in a potential $50,000 lifetime reduction in additional interventions such, as behavioral and occupational therapy, special education, and the need for healthcare and educational aides.  This amounts to over $200,000,000 in savings per year to the health and education systems.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need, expressed by parents and therapists, for a device that will allow infants with motor impairment to move independently at the same age as their typically developing peers. Currently, no such device is available.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is the development of a novel control method for a powered device that can be used by infants as young as 6 months old:  The device moves in the direction that the infant leans (as when reaching toward a toy or parent) while preventing collisions and falls.  Previous research has shown that infants as young as five months old can learn to use this control method to purposefully steer a powered device in all directions. The research objectives of this project are to build and validate a second-generation prototype that can be used by parents and clinicians outside of a research setting. Successful completion of these objectives will advance the device from a research testbed to a viable, if limited, prototype, enabling future work to evaluate the impact of the device on the development of cognitive, social, and communication skills for infants with disabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind’s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot’s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot’s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to enhance scientific and technological understanding in selective harvesting of high-value crops such as strawberry. The innovation proposed here will be a key component in creating a compact economically viable autonomous strawberry harvesting robot. The technology developed in this project will help address the farming labor shortage which is experienced by farmers more and more each year. Agricultural robotics market is estimated to be $11.9 billion by 2026. Providing autonomous harvesting robots will enable farmers to grow more crops with less business risks related to manual labor shortages and will ensure that US farmers remain competitive, while creating more skilled, highly paid jobs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop critical technologies for delicate selective harvesting of fragile crops such as strawberries at a competitive pace. Recent advancements in computer vision object detection and three-dimensional scene reconstruction will be used to create near real-time operational scenes. Those scenes will be used to detect ripe berries, create a movement path and navigate the fast and precise robot arm for harvesting the berries without damaging fruits while avoiding obstacles.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to introduce a cost-effective way of crop protection from fungal spoilage. Every year, 25% of the food produced by the world is wasted due to fungal infections and contamination of crops with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The combined social, environmental, and economic global annual cost of this food wastage is >$2T. The proposed innovation is centered on harnessing an untapped bacterium to bring a new line of affordable antifungals to a broad base of crop growers across the United States, which are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing preharvest postharvest treatment protocols. The products are quick and easy to manufacture without costly purification procedures. They should be safe for the environment and human health and have a defined mechanism of action. As a result, billions of dollars’ worth of crops, energy, and resources could be saved, leading to increased agricultural sustainability and economic competitiveness of the United States. It may also advance the health and welfare of the American public by enhancing food safety. Finally, it can pave the way for other innovations to combat fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation by developing the first product, safeguarding corn crops from fungal spoilage during both preharvest and postharvest. Corn is the most planted crop in the United States. Every year, the corn industry loses >$1B due to infection with a fungus (Aspergillus flavus), resulting in contamination of the crop with a carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. The critical technical objectives during the project period will be to (1) identify the functional components of the product and demonstrate their mode of action; (2) assess the amounts of those components that can be produced per unit mass of bacterial biomass, (3) determine an optimal formulation of the minimal viable product that can be most effective in preventing fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination in the corn crop, and (4) conduct an optimal toxicity profiling of the minimal viable product. Upon completion, the knowledge obtained will provide valuable insights for effective intellectual protection and regulatory strategy for the products from the technology and identify any potential challenges related to scalability, consistency, and product shelf-life, which will determine the costs and logistics for large-scale manufacturing of the products.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept of using an innovative open aquatic algae cultivation system (OAACS) to overcome scale and cost constraints of current large-scale algal biomass production systems like raceway ponds. Drop-in biofuels derived from OAACS’ biomass have a projected minimum fuel selling price of $2.53/gasoline gallon equivalent, which is competitive with fossil fuels, and have potential production scales that exceed current global fossil fuel usage. Successful commercialization of OAACS can lead to new sustainable energy sources, significant displacement of fossil fuel use, and concomitant reductions in the future environmental and societal impacts of global climate change. If successful, OAACS can also pave the way for sustainable, competitive, and meaningfully large-scale production of other bioproducts like fertilizers and high protein feeds.

    The proposed project aims to fabricate robust liners for OAACS using an innovative forced assembly co-extrusion and two-dimensional multiplication technique and then demonstrate their performance in OAACS scale-down laboratory photobioreactors. The minimum success criterion is production of liners that support sustained algal aerial yields >15 g ash free dry weight/m2/day for weeks or months without the need for liner cleaning or CO2 supplementation. This will establish feasibility that OAACS can meet production scale- and cost-targets. Tasks include: 1. Fabrication and physical characterization of base case liners using previously demonstrated techniques and then extending results to liners with pore size gradients and surface modified nanofibers; 2. Demonstrating high dissolved inorganic carbon transfer rates through the liners; and 3. Demonstrating robust performance of the liners during continuous culturing in laboratory photobioreactors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable discovery of needed T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapeutics for late-stage cancer patients who have limited treatment options. These immunotherapies work by leveraging T-cells engineered with TCRs that will identify and destroy cancer cells that naturally present a marker (antigen) specific to the cancer on their surface (e.g., cancer mutations). This project will develop a high-throughput platform capable of screening many thousands of TCRs against many thousands of antigens to identify clinically relevant TCRs. This project could impact society’s health by discovering TCRs that will serve as the basis for treatments against currently incurable cancers. The commercial impacts are potentially large. The total market size of T-cell therapeutics was $2.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $8.5 billion by 2027. The platform described by this proposal has the potential to discover many TCR based therapeutics, creating value for patient and society at large.

    The proposed project is to develop a platform for identifying clinically valuable TCRs. This platform could be critical for developing new immunotherapies against solid tumors and for understanding the biology that underlies TCR-antigen interaction. Screening thousands of TCRs for functional activation against thousands of antigens is challenging due to the difficulty of tracking interactions between hundreds of thousands of unique cells. The proposed platform and method links T-cell activation with phagocytosis using engineered T-macrophage and antigen presenting cell (APC) lines. T-macrophages engulf APCs as directed by TCR activation, capturing evidence of an interaction within the T-macrophage. The resulting interactions can be read from the T-macrophages via single-cell sequencing. The objective of this project is to produce large cell-based libraries for TCR and antigens and to identify interacting TCR-antigen pairs. The antigen library will include hundreds of clinically relevant cancer targets, such as KRAS and TP53. These results will demonstrate the feasibility of our platform.

    \ $50 million per annum and is expected to grow with the new superior performance\
    \ and with increasing need which grows more acute with time. Such improved instruments\
    \ can beneficially impact major industries such as semiconductors ($450 billlon\
    \ per year) and metals ($12 trillion per year). Improvements in the quality, quantity,\
    \ and availability of atomic-scale information from imaging mass spectrometry\
    \ instruments thus can have a large impact on technological progress. The advances\
    \ sought in this project are the first steps toward new tools that will meet the\
    \ demands of scientists and engineers for decades. \n\nThe intellectual merit\
    \ of this project is embodied in an experimental test of a new optical approach\
    \ to control beam divergence from point sources of charged particles. By controlling\
    \ beam divergence, ion imaging detectors can be optimally adapted to record images\
    \ with superior properties. This will significantly advance fields of stigmatic-imaging\

    \ simulations have been conducted and used to aid design of prototype ion optics.\
    \ The ability of these optics to control the ion beam divergence while projecting\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will result in powerful technology for detecting illicit cryptocurrency accounts and funds in close to real time. The commercial and market impact of the technology will be substantial with its ability to trace illicit accounts and funds to a depth and breadth never before possible and to accomplish this in seconds to minutes, as compared to the long to indefinite time it would take conventional network tracing technology.  For society at large, the ability to uncover the most complex money laundering and fraud schemes will help cut the flow of funds to the worst actors using cryptocurrency: organized crime, narcotics dealers, child pornographers, human traffickers, terrorists, and rogue nations. With the platform created in this project, governments in conjunction with the private sector will have tools that can effectively address the sophistication of the criminal schemes.  This will in turn result in greater growth of the cryptocurrency-based economy as businesses and individuals gain greater confidence that they are dealing with legitimate entities that are not seeking to defraud them.

    This SBIR Phase I project will bring to light the most sophisticated illicit schemes involving cryptocurrencies. In doing so, it will secure cryptocurrency systems and advance the fields of network analysis and visualization, which will be needed to understand the schemes. There are three major technical hurdles in the Phase I project. First, the proposed implementation and infrastructure for the network tracing algorithms need to be scaled up to trace the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains in real-time. Second, to be able to trace addresses to known illicit accounts, a sufficient number of these accounts need to be identified. The proposed project will develop software for cross referencing account addresses with both on-chain and clear and dark web activity to build the lists of known bad actor addresses.  Third, for customers to believe the results of the analysis, a network visualization tool to show the chains of custody linking a suspect account to a known illicit account must be created. Because the algorithms can detect the schemes involving thousands of fund transfers between accounts, visualizing the links in a clear manner presents unique challenges. The project will therefore also build the foundation for its novel visualization tool in Phase I.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable very highly-efficient low-cost green hydrogen production by improving a key functional component of a promising water electrolysis technology. Green hydrogen is a chemical fuel and a feedstock with no associated CO2 emissions. In an effort to decarbonize our economy, green hydrogen can address sectors of our economy that are not easily electrified using clean electricity, for example steelmaking, chemicals, heating, and heavy transport such as shipping and aviation. However, the cost of green hydrogen is still too high to prompt large-scale adoption. The pure-water electrolyzers developed in this project can significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs compared to the current state-of-the-art: they require only water and electricity as inputs, and are entirely made of low-cost, non-toxic materials, utilizing domestic supply chains. They are modular, enabling the development of both large hydrogen production facilities and small decentralized systems, e.g., for on-site operations or refueling stations. This project will not only help the adoption of green hydrogen, it will also elucidate how the chemical and electrochemical modifications of active surfaces can more broadly be used to make electrochemical reactions, such as water splitting, more efficient.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to drastically improve a key component of an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMEL): the anode electrode. The anode is the site of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a required but inefficient step during electrolytic hydrogen production. Enhancement of the OER kinetics by improved anode design, if translated to commercial AEMEL systems, would directly lead to a lower cost of green hydrogen. This project aims to replace the conventional two-layer anode, in which a complex catalyst layer is coated on top of a porous transport layer (PTL), with a simpler “unified” anode, in which the PTL is functionalized such that the catalyst layer is no longer necessary and the reaction kinetics are improved. In this project, two approaches to functionalize the PTL surface will be combined: the increase of the electrochemically active surface area (via etching, dealloying, and deposition techniques) and the increase of the intrinsic catalytic OER activity (via alloying and deposition techniques). This effort is expected to result in significantly improved AEMEL performance and lifetime, which will be evaluated using electrochemical methods, both ex situ (3-electrode cell) and in situ (in an operating electrolyzer).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a semiconductor laser technology based on laterally confined photonic crystal cavities. The proposed laser technology may ensure secure semiconductor and microelectronic supply chains within US for energy-efficient high-capacity data center link capabilities, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous driving/aerial vehicles, high performance communication and sensing systems, etc. The novel solution may accelerate technology development, address technical and market gaps, and foster entrepreneurship with important social impacts. The project will help prepare a diversified workforce skilled in semiconductor production, nanotechnology, photonics and optics, and advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize high speed photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSELs) with single-mode, high power output. PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve measurement science.  Currently, special low-pressure chambers known as "vapor cells" are made by hand in a select number of precision glassblowing shops and suffer from poor dimensional reproducibility, low production capacity, irregular sizes, and variable vapor composition leading to a multifaceted limitation in the marketplace. Optical frequency references on the market today are large, costly, and power-hungry, but are used in a variety of commercial opportunities throughout industrial metrology markets. This study aims to produce a repeatable recipe suitable for high-volume production of miniature vapor cells. The results of this study will lead to the scalable production of references that would be intrinsically trustworthy and perform well in a continuous manner over many years.

    This STTR Phase I project will leverage micromachining of glass and silicon to enable a new fabrication method for a traditionally handmade component: a glass-blown vapor cell. The research objective of this study is to test if such a method can yield a compact and reproducible vapor cell. Research will employ semiconductor processing techniques and optical frequency metrology to deduce the long-term stability and accuracy of these vapor cells in order to assess their suitability as optical frequency references. The anticipated technical results of this study include a potential pathway to a mass-produced optical frequency standard suitable for optical clocks, interferometers, and wavemeters. Such a technology would underpin accurate measurement science in high-performance optical measurement equipment.

    \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a diagnostic product that addresses\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a wider adoption of autonomous technologies among residential buildings. This research proposes evaluating the use of advanced sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable inexpensive hardware infrastructures to control the conditions in indoor space autonomously. This technology fits well within the capacity of residential buildings. One main benefit of indoor automation is deep energy savings. The Department of Energy estimates a 5% reduction of the country's total energy bill if existing residential buildings save 25% of their energy consumption. The autonomous controller evaluated in this project has the potential to reach this goal, saving the nation up to $63 billion and the planet 284 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Alongside energy efficiency, the associated societal benefits of the proposed project can potentially save lives. The technologies may spur a higher level of security protection among many unprotected residential spaces. Additionally, tracking occupants’ habits may enable alerts to caregivers or family members in critical emergency situations. This can be beneficial for the aging population that wants to stay within the comfort of their own home.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the scientific knowledge required to approach full autonomous control in indoor spaces. The use of advanced perception sensors in buildings will be evaluated. Their rich data stream will be utilized to develop advanced algorithms for autonomous control of indoor spaces. Advances in sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms will be used to instigate technological evolution in autonomous building systems.  A proof of concept will be developed to mitigate the unique risks associated caused by applying autonomous control in indoor spaces, specifically: achieving advanced perception, self-programmability, and reliability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to apply low-cost radiofrequency (RF) sensing hardware to detect, monitor, and localize transmitters in industrial and urban environments. This technology can solve key problems in manufacturing and logistics operations such as finding RF transmitters that are interfering with operations or monitoring the health of radio systems. These activities are required in modern industrial environments as increasing numbers of critical systems rely on radio communications to operate. In urban environments, automating the tasks of detecting, monitoring, and localizing transmitters can simplify the management of large-scale radio networks and gather critical data on wireless device usage. Increased instances of intentional jamming and the rollout of new communications standards such as 5G make these tasks critical to the modern city. Traditionally, such monitoring tasks are conducted manually with expensive spectrum monitoring equipment. Automated installations also utilize expensive sensors, making automated spectrum monitoring only feasible in safety-critical areas such as around airports. Lower-cost sensors can be installed permanently at a high density for almost any application, allowing cities and smaller industrial customers to deploy persistent monitoring networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy high-density networks of low-cost sensors, determine the efficacy of existing detection and localization algorithms as applied to the network, and evaluate novel machine-learning (ML) algorithms for similar tasks. This project will also mitigate the technical risk of deploying such a system by characterizing how well commodity software-defined radio (SDR) hardware can perform across a variety of operational environments. No high-density and large-scale test networks of inexpensive radio hardware have been deployed for the purposes of industrial and urban spectrum monitoring, so data gathered throughout this SBIR Phase I project will be useful in evaluating the viability of this approach. By evaluating ML algorithms for signal detection and localization, this project can help determine how effective machine learning models can be at ingesting RF data from low-cost sensors and synthesizing actionable outputs about the radio environment. The result of this project will be an analysis of the detection and localization performance of a variety of algorithms across different environments and sensor node densities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable nanofiber integration in a wide variety of applications that were previously cost prohibitive. The technology will enable both the cost-efficient production of nanofibers at commercially acceptable rates, as well as the development of unique nanofiber materials with properties compatible with specific industry uses.  The high-capacity batteries developed as part of this effort may give rise to advancements in the energy industry enabling electricity distribution via microgrids and solar arrays, in turn supporting energy resilience, independence, and sustainability. Further, the commercialization of this technology platform for facile nanofiber production at scale may create prospects for nanofiber use across a multitude of industries, such as: textiles for fine-mesh surgical face masks and thermal regulating clothing, remediation of water and air, tissue engineering and wound care, and defense applications such as low-weight aircraft, bulletproof uniforms, and personal protective equipment for  use against chemical/biological agents.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a low cost, high-throughput process to fabricate nanofibers with unique properties, enabling their integration into a variety of end applications. Traditional DC electrospinning methods have low nanofiber production rates, preventing their widespread adoption. This project develops an alternating field electrospinning (AFES) process capable of producing a wide variety of unique nanofibers at a rate thousands of times faster than existing systems. Phase I research objectives include: the characterization of different thermal settings for AFES electrospinning and studies of the impacts on material properties, the expansion of classes of materials compatible with the AFES system, and the fabrication of materials with application-specific properties.  This work will involve extensive testing and characterization of nanofibers produced under a variety of thermal process settings.  The researchers will also incorporate the nanofibers into lithium ion batteries to quantify capabilities and identify optimal silicon nanofiber characteristics for the application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.
