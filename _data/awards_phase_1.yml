    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to minimize short-and long- term effects of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, impact, and other conditions.  The proposed project advances an oral system capable of monitoring physiology and physical responses.  The initial application of athletics enables development of a tool that can be used more broadly for health monitoring of military forces and other users at risk.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a durable, adaptable, and wholly instrumented physiology monitoring mouth guard system that can provide real-time tracking of a range of biometrics, such as impact force and body temperature. Intra-oral measurements lend themselves monitoring and assessment, and a mouth guard can collect precise multi-sensor data at low power, then transmit data wirelessly. The proposed research and development activities will focus on development and integration of sensors and wireless communication capabilities for real-time data on health (e.g., core temperature), movement (e.g., acceleration, rotational motion), and impact forces (e.g., high-velocity collision).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel resuscitator to ventilate patients with respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.  With almost 300,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and approximately 350,000 in-hospital cases each year in the United States, a modest increase of just 5% in the number of patients surviving cardiac arrest would correspond to more than 33,000 additional lives saved. In 2017, the combined direct and indirect costs of deaths from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for patients under 50 years of age to be $455 billion, with an estimate of $1.8 trillion for all deaths from cardiac arrest. On this basis, every 1% increase in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate would result in a $4.5 billion cost saving to the United States economy.The proposed project addresses the technical challenges associated with a novel device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advance translation of a bag-valve-mask resuscitator that restricts the volume, pressure, and rate of ventilation to safe levels for any patient, from infant to adult. The goal of the project is to design and test a fully functioning prototype that incorporates an easy-to-use mechanism for quickly and simultaneously adjusting both the maximum volume of air delivered and the maximum pressure, and a mechanism for restricting ventilation rate. The project objectives are:  (1)  prototype and test a novel dial-operated mechanism for simultaneous volume and pressure control; (2) test a flow-based mechanism for restricting the ventilation rate; (3) compare the prototype performance with that of a standard bag-valve-mask resuscitator used by a group of trained medical personnel. Successful completion of this project will result in a fully functional prototype, a valuable set of data on the device performance, and important feedback from end-users on design, ease of use, and device functionality to inform future modifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the prevalence of severe diabetic foot ulcers. These ulcers affect one-fourth of patients with diabetes over their lifetimes, significantly impacting mobility and life expectancy. When treatment for an ulcer is too late, the only option is often amputation; in fact, diabetic foot ulcers account for the majority of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Reducing the incidence of severe ulcers will improve the health and welfare of the American public as well as mitigate the economic burden of diabetes on the American healthcare system. By some estimates, treatment for diabetic foot ulcers accounts for one-third of all direct diabetic healthcare spending. Therefore, preventing these ulcers would save the US healthcare system tens of billions of dollars per year. The proposed solution will monitor foot ulcers consistently to prevent further damage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a computer vision system for detecting and monitoring diabetic foot ulcers with an imaging device. The current standard of care is for patients to inspect their own feet visually every day, but these inspections happen inconsistently and unreliably. If successful, this system will automatically identify patients’ feet consistently across several days and lighting conditions. It will classify late-stage wounds, allowing physicians to monitor progression or healing of ulcers. Further, it will estimate the risk of future ulcers, enabling early-stage intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to address a significant pain point for farmers associated with reducing nitrogen fertilizer input costs. The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer.  These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk.

    The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to address critical health, safety, cost and energy challenges in recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) disinfection. Growing high quality protein at larger scales cannot be done with current animal husbandry techniques without generating excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Intensive RAS technologies offer a viable alternative because they are capable of producing high quality protein with minimal impact on the environment.  Protecting the health of the fish is one of the key limitations to a more rapid growth of this industry.  This project will improve food production at scale. Furthermore, the proposed technology may be applied to drinking water.

    This STTR Phase I project will advance a technology for safe and low-energy bacteria disinfection in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) by using a durable, low-cost method to generate singlet oxygen, an excited-state form of molecular oxygen.  Ozone and ultraviolet light are mainstay disinfectants in the fish farm industry, but they are expensive, energy-intensive and can be toxic to fish and personnel; motivating advances in safe, low-energy disinfection.  Singlet oxygen is a powerful disinfecting agent lethal to pathogens and harmless to fish and humans. The primary innovation of this project allows singlet oxygen to be generated at high efficiency without contaminating the water as it is not persistent. This project will conduct engineering studies as a function of both chemical structure and mass transport of reactants and products.  Detailed models will be developed to determine the appropriate dimensions of the disinfection system as well as understand the interactions between singlet oxygen and pathogens.  These models will be the first to couple transport phenomena with absorption/desorption kinetics in this configuration for RAS.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to scale nature-based climate mitigation.  The Phase 1 project will create and manage comprehensive data sets and models representing the current and proposed future state of ecosystem health as measured by aboveground biomass growth in forests, the health and carbon sequestration in soils, and the restoration of groundwater in arid or otherwise degraded environments through the restoration of hydrological function. Through its open source and community-oriented approach, the project intends to be a valuable resource for organizations mitigating loss of biodiversity, soil health, forest cover, and groundwater due to extractive land use practices. The information provided by this technology will be useful for landowners, governmental authorities, researchers, and financial institutions.

    The project will utilize recent advances in remote sensing, cloud compute infrastructure, and machine learning to predict the highest leverage land-based interventions for managing and enhancing the hydrological cycle, protecting forests and increasing reforestation efforts, and building soil health and resiliency through soil organic carbon sequestration. The highest impact water interventions will be determined using random forest algorithms improved through the use of soil models that include porosity, rates of runoff, and texture. The forest-based interventions for conserving and increasing above-ground biomass will be based on historic land use change and disturbance regimes as monitored through satellite imagery and coupled with potential sequestration rates achieved through restoration and improved forest management. Soil health and carbon sequestration modeling will be accomplished using historic soil sample data over an 80 year period and the associated environmental covariates in addition to research into rates of soil sequestration by land management type. This will enable the training of a random forest-based model to predict the highest impact land use interventions to enhance or restore soil organic carbon. These models will be combined to create an interactive land viewer.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I Project is to measure the most critical metrics associated with breastfeeding in real time, namely milk volume and suck patterns. Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life is highly recommended. While U.S. breastfeeding initiation rates exceed 80%, only 25% of women are able to reach the six-month goal. The leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation is maternal anxiety about milk supply exacerbated by the absence of an accurate, inexpensive, and convenient means to assess infant milk intake. The current standard-of-care, weighing an infant before and after feeding, requires an expensive clinical scale to detect a 1-2% weight change, trained staff, tight swaddling of the infant, careful operation, and regular calibration. Even then, it’s still a tedious exercise and thus does not provide a quality representative measure of daily milk intake. There is therefore a need for a “thermometer for breastfeeding” – an accurate, easy-to-use device to be used for multiple feedings in both clinical and home settings. The technology developed in this project can be used for rapid identification and intervention for infants at high risk of feeding problems.

    This project aims to develop and validate the accuracy of a low-cost wearable patch measuring milk volume and suck patterns in real time. The patch operates by detecting changes in the shape and electrical properties of the breast and can be used for 1-12 feedings per day. Data are reported to a mobile app for tracking and analysis, as well as integration with other key metrics of infant feeding and growth. Several patch configurations will be built and tested to optimize the design and analysis algorithm. The design with highest accuracy will be further validated in a larger study involving breastfeeding mother-infant dyads.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable nanofiber integration in a wide variety of applications that were previously cost prohibitive. The technology will enable both the cost-efficient production of nanofibers at commercially acceptable rates, as well as the development of unique nanofiber materials with properties compatible with specific industry uses.  The high-capacity batteries developed as part of this effort may give rise to advancements in the energy industry enabling electricity distribution via microgrids and solar arrays, in turn supporting energy resilience, independence, and sustainability. Further, the commercialization of this technology platform for facile nanofiber production at scale may create prospects for nanofiber use across a multitude of industries, such as: textiles for fine-mesh surgical face masks and thermal regulating clothing, remediation of water and air, tissue engineering and wound care, and defense applications such as low-weight aircraft, bulletproof uniforms, and personal protective equipment for  use against chemical/biological agents.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a low cost, high-throughput process to fabricate nanofibers with unique properties, enabling their integration into a variety of end applications. Traditional DC electrospinning methods have low nanofiber production rates, preventing their widespread adoption. This project develops an alternating field electrospinning (AFES) process capable of producing a wide variety of unique nanofibers at a rate thousands of times faster than existing systems. Phase I research objectives include: the characterization of different thermal settings for AFES electrospinning and studies of the impacts on material properties, the expansion of classes of materials compatible with the AFES system, and the fabrication of materials with application-specific properties.  This work will involve extensive testing and characterization of nanofibers produced under a variety of thermal process settings.  The researchers will also incorporate the nanofibers into lithium ion batteries to quantify capabilities and identify optimal silicon nanofiber characteristics for the application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative method to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). UGIB results in more than 550,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone with a mortality rate of up to 20%. The gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding market is projected to be nearly USD 1 billion by 2026, with the overall hemostatic agents market reaching over USD 5 billion. Current solutions require endoscopy performed by a specialist or hospital admission. The proposed approach is a drinkable formulation to stop bleeding after ingestion, eliminating the need for endoscopic intervention or hospitalization. The technology developed in this project could then be applied to other bleeding scenarios, including field/combat medicine or rapid treatment of hemorrhage during surgical complications. The gel can also be used as a drug delivery vehicle for a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new approach to achieve hemostasis in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), based on a novel thermosensitive gel (thermogel) formulation. The drinkable formulation is liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a mucoadhesive gel when warmed to body temperature, thereby treating hemorrhage in the upper GI tract without the need for endoscopic intervention. Its action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) The in situ gelation of the mucoadhesive thermogel provides a mechanical barrier against blood flow, and (2) the slow release of drugs from the thermogel at the hemorrhage site enables more rapid healing. Initial efforts will be dedicated to formulation development wherein compatibility of the thermogel with different drug candidates will be evaluated, and optimization of the gelation temperature will be performed. The best formulations will then be tested in vitro for stability, drug release kinetics, and mucoadhesion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach will be assessed in preclinical models of bleeding, demonstrating its superior ability to reach hemostasis. This is expected to apply to disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and oral mucositis.

    \ reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the expected ecological\
    \ benefits of this technology. This technology could also facilitate more efficient\

    \ to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will\
    \ then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity\
    \ to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag\
    \ will give an audio alert potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage\
    \ the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide timely and highly localized climate forecasts, plus information such as extreme heat and frost risk, to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Climate forecasting at sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales is challenging, yet essential for proactive risk management of extreme natural hazards.  This project will leverage artificial intelligence and cloud computing to implement a data-intensive approach for revolutionizing global climate forecasting. The project will provide efficient and accurate seasonal forecasts at relatively low computational cost in a user-friendly web environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop a localized, timely, and reliable climate forecasting system that is industry-focused and crop-specific. In this project, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques will be deployed to advance operational climate forecasting skill at a global scale. While conventional forecasts are trained exclusively on observational data, this project will train models on historical simulations and reanalysis, then evaluate them with observations. In this approach, the training dataset is substantially larger, consequently improving accuracy. This processing at scale is enabled with cloud resources.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal is in the development of a new carbon utilization technology with the ability to make high-value, essential products from carbon dioxide (CO2) like cellulosic textiles, food, and building materials. Enzymatic carbon utilization is of high interest due to its ability to make high-value natural products from carbon dioxide. The impediment to enzymatic carbon utilization technology has been the short longevity of both enzymes and input molecules under cell-free industrial conditions. This project will yield a novel enzyme stabilization approach for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes. The resulting system may unlock CO2 as a new, natural resource for essential product supply chains that are carbon-negative and water- and land-neutral, unlocking a $10 trillion global market. This scalable technology could create a new carbon industry and advance manufacturing jobs in the United States. This technology could enable sustainable and domestic production of America’s most essential materials from waste carbon dioxide emissions at a cheaper cost than today’s production.

    This project involves a production method that applies a bio-inspired, non-covalent enzyme stabilization strategy that employs cell-free conversion of carbon emissions into cellulosic fibers for textiles in a CO2-to-textile process over industrially relevant time periods. The proposed stabilization method preserves enzyme conformation without harming baseline activity to allow for enzymatic activity in non-natural environments. The heteropolymers are synthesized using a standard reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization approach to produce disordered polymeric chains with diverse monomers of varying charges and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics to complement and stabilize enzymes surfaces. The disordered nature of the polymers enables local surface binding to stabilize the enzyme, maintaining its conformation and protecting against denaturing or degradation. The project scope covers key technical hurdles: (1) the development of a enzyme stabilization technique for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes, (2) the development of a carbon conversion system and process in a non-natural, industrial environment, and (3) confirmation of a full proof-of-concept solution that can be scalable from mL to 50L scale. If successful, the result is an effective enzyme stabilization method that can fix carbon emissions under cell-free conditions for use in industrial supply chains.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient semiconductor chips dedicated to solving challenges with many possible outcomes and inherent uncertainty. Such problems are encountered in decision-making, risk management, chip design, drug design, business analytics, machine learning, computing failure rates of manufactured products, pricing complex financial derivatives, resource allocation in 5G networks and financial portfolios. Current methods for addressing these problems are intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed chips would quantify the uncertainty and find suitable solutions to many real-world challenges with faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient methods.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on advancing probabilistic computers for probabilistic computing. Decision-making, econometrics, risk management, chip design, and drug development are not deterministic. By leveraging the natural stochasticity of specific devices, it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of devices otherwise used for the same computational tasks. The proposed computational architecture and pipelining enables improved computational speed, power consumption, and chip manufacturing costs. The goals of this project are two-fold. The first is to deliver 10-1000x improvement in computation speed compared to CPUs and GPUs using the emulation of probabilistic computers on Field Programmable Gate Arrays. The same task will make projections about the performance of the actual probabilistic computer. The second is to quantify how well the probabilistic computer can accommodate semiconductor manufacturing process variations. Controlling such variations is a significant factor in semiconductor manufacturing costs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to increase the diversity of people engaging in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) by broadening the creative and expressive possibilities at the intersection of craft and circuit design.  The project hypothesizes that by creating design and digital fabrication tools that leverage familiar paper craft practices and the intrinsic motivational value the arts, circuit design and fabrication can be made accessible to those who are novices to circuit design and fabrication.  Research shows that this approach is especially successful for reaching those who otherwise may not participate in STEM, especially underrepresented minorities, girls and women. By developing software to support digital circuit design and fabrication, this project enables users to easily share and build off of digital design templates, expanding the reach of beginner-friendly starter projects and creating a community of learners who can co-create and co-teach. Further, by enabling creators to connect circuit design to consumer-friendly digital fabrication technologies like desktop craft cutters, we will bring the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditionally technical environments and into entirely new and more mainstream audiences.

    The technical innovation is the development of novel electrical design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing electronics computer aided design tools, making the tool accessible to novice users such as educators, hobbyists and artists.  This will be done through the elimination of schematic abstractions along with powerful simulation capabilities uniquely catered for expressive and artistic technological creations.  By combining beginner-appropriate electronic footprints with a drawing interface for sketching traces, users will be able to represent their designs exactly as they would appear when built.  By incorporating electrical rule checks along with simulation of circuit behavior, the software will allow users to iterate on their designs with confidence before they invest time in fabricating. To address these challenges, the design of the software and accompanying physical toolkit will be designed iteratively and in close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters through a series of user studies to ensure that the intended audience who have never used electronic design software before can manufacture their designs easily while being able to express their diverse interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a reliable, economically viable, and cost-effective domestic supply of cobalt, nickel, and manganese by harvesting critical metals from spent lithium ion batteries. These critical metals are needed in modern infrastructure, transportation and communication. Today, the United States imports 78% of cobalt it consumes annually but recycles only 5% of cobalt-containing lithium-ion batteries. Replacing cobalt with nickel and manganese in these batteries puts supply of those metals at risk. This project proposes a straightforward recovery process to create supply chain stability, more economic activity through recyclers and less landfilling of potentially dangerous lithium ion batteries. The project aims to create standalone processing units that can be added to existing battery processing to create a refined source of these key metals for domestic use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new approach to lithium ion battery recycling by integrating a metal sulfide sorbent technology into a capacitive deionization (CDI) electrochemical system for scalable and efficient recovery of cobalt, nickel, and manganese from spent batteries. CDI is an emerging process for removing charged species from a feed solution using porous electrodes. This work pairs CDI with efficient metal-sulfide sorbents by integrating the sorbent material into the cathodes for efficient recovery of critical metals from black mass leach solution. While CDI has typically involved carbon cathodes, metal sulfide sorbents have been selected for surface doping owing to their remarkable stability, adsorption capacity, and expected amenability to casting. The proposed work will: 1)  demonstrate viable cation uptake from black mass into the sorbent material; 2) construct a capacitive deionization cell with the sorbent material integrated into the cathode for increased recovery; and 3) demonstrate recovery with appropriate selectivity toward cobalt, nickel, and manganese separations from black mass using a novel CDI cell.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase aquaculture productivity by reducing disease impact. Disease costs billions in losses each year to the aquaculture industry and threatens the global food supply. The disease caused by White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) can devastate a shrimp farm and costs over $1 billion in losses each year. Farmers are often unaware of a disease issue until animals show advanced signs of disease or there are mortalities. Laboratory diagnosis is expensive and results take days-to-weeks, which is often far too long for results to be actionable. Early warning of white spot disease can enable farmers to take immediate action to reduce losses, reducing costs and increasing industrial robustness.  This project advances a new diagnostic to quickly, easily, and reliably detect WSSV in cultivated shrimp in a new easy-to-use, on-site test.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance translation of a novel diagnostic for WSSV in a technology incorporating engineered proteins with specific targets into a paper-based biosensor. Prior studies demonstrated proof-of-concept with a paper-based immunoassay with polymerization-based amplification for detection of protein-based biomarkers for HRP2–the primary protein biomarker of malaria–with sensitivity as low as 70pM. This project will bioengineer thermostable rcSso7d DNA-binding proteins to bind the WSSV target and incorporate them into the paper testing format. Assay sensitivity, reagent composition, and dynamic range will be explored as part of an effort to understand the biological and functionally meaningful limits of the developed assay. Tasks include a WSSV challenge study to evaluate the sampling parameters and detection limits of the prototype in laboratory cultured shrimp. The resulting prototype will rapidly and selectively bind the WSSV target and yield stable, easily interpretable, colorimetric results.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the proposed SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications) prototype, designed as a best-in-class pressure, temperature, and seismic sensor system to be incorporated into new global submarine fiber optic cable networks. The expected commercial impacts are significant, as the customer base for SMART technology includes commercial submarine cable suppliers, government monitoring agencies, scientific consortia and agencies, and internet content providers. The development and deployment of SMART will enhance scientific understanding of Earth’s oceans, seafloor, and subsurface via a fundamentally new approach to long-term subsea sensor network deployments. SMART will therefore provide essential new data to reduce disaster risk and improve global climate understanding, thereby reducing societal and environmental vulnerabilities to these long- and short-term threats.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop the first integrated SMART prototype system. This innovative real-time deep ocean monitoring technology will catalyze fundamental improvements in Tsunami Early Warning (TEW), Earthquake Early Warning (EEW), global climate monitoring and telecommunications resiliency.  The innovation is to tightly integrate sensors into the amplifiers (“repeaters”) used to boost signals in the optical fibers. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components will be utilized for nearly all physical elements of the system. The sensor assembly includes a 3-axis accelerometer, absolute pressure gauge, and temperature sensor, integrated with data acquisition circuits with suitable dynamic range and precision, a common communications module, an interface suitable for fiber optic cable spans up to 120 km in length, software and firmware necessary to support the data path, an isolated power source, and precision timing. The SMART repeater design is modular, allowing different sensors, adaptation to different repeater housings, or use as a standalone unit. Technical hurdles to be addressed include hardware development and integration, software development, data acquisition and processing, power management, communications bandwidth, and delivery of precision time and frequency references.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project include a high performance, low cos, dependable, novel antenna with high data bandwidth in 1000s of Gb (Tb) and high data rate speeds in 1000s of Gb/s (Tb/s). The elevated performance of this antenna, the cost effectiveness due to its 3D rapid prototype printing fabrication, and the easy integration to existing technologies may promote proliferation of wireless communications. The antenna may enable global connectivity and increase access to internet/phone connectivity for previously inaccessible areas of the globe, especially to disadvantaged and underserved communities. The high data bandwidth and speed rates will positively impact the scientific community and technologies based on data transfer such as remote learning, remote healthcare (remote surgery, patient consultation), the defense industry, telework (work from home during this COVID-19 pandemic), etc. The antenna’s technical superiority and low cost support substantial anticipated commercial success.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses critical challenges in the two emerging wireless communications systems: LEO-SATCOM (Low Earth Orbit – Satellite Communications) and 5G mobile phone/internet. This project will develop a unique antenna technology that will be integrated into satellite gateways, 5G ground terminals and also satellites in orbit. The wide aperture angle of the antenna provides a wide scanning angle capability that enables connection to highly inclined satellites. The antenna is also capable of multi-beam analysis to enable the simultaneous tracking of multiple satellites and to insure no down time during handoffs. The radiation beam pattern has excellent characteristics of high gain (Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power), very narrow beamwidth, and low cross polarization.

Chronic pain affects 20% of U.S. adults and costs $600 billion annually. Opioids are often the first treatment option offered to patients with chronic pain. Currently pain is assessed using simplistic, subjective and generalized visual/verbal scales (1-10) with little ability to localize the origin. It is essential for clinicians and medical researchers to have calibrated and accurate measures of pain to assist patients in determining the underlying disease and directing patients to the most effective therapies. This project will develop a new biomedical tool to quantify pain data for multimodal treatment plans to potentially minimize opioid use. This tool will improve quality of life for people suffering from chronic pain and help those on opioids find better therapies. Furthermore, it will help clinicians with varied levels of training and experience achieve the highest level of exam skill.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will digitize a physical exam by capturing palpation location and pressure and patient pain expression via multiple biosensors to create a personalized “contour” map of pain intensity onto a 3D image of the human body. This comprehensive and calibrated data set can then be used to assist clinicians in developing a more accurate differential diagnosis for the underlying pain condition. This project will advance the hardware and software components for future integration with augmented reality and artificial intelligence modules.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve radiology and management of medical imaging equipment. The proposed analytics platform will provide detailed insight into device utilization to help oversee operations, optimize workflows, better leverage existing equipment, and evaluate the success of investments.  More efficient use of scanners is expected to substantially benefit the patient population as it will reduce the wait time for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increase patient access, shorten imaging protocols, reduce sedation duration, reduce and predict delays, and ultimately improve the patient experience. The data unlocked by the platform will also open new avenues of research for radiologists and researchers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology that repurposes the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data created by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to build a unified, query-able source of knowledge about imaging exams. This project will harmonize DICOM metadata and build upon it to create an ontology that describes all the facets of imaging exams. Areas of development include recovering acquisition duration and scanner activity through algorithms that analyze images and exams to infer when the scanner was truly active. The project also demonstrates the impact of the data source by training a machine learning model to automatically detect repeated images, a prominent source of schedule delays.  Overall, the developments from this project construct key aspects of timing and workflow from DICOM data to enable a new form of data analytics in Radiology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a tool that will streamline the clinical trial process, reducing time and money spent without sacrificing safety or an understanding of a treatment’s efficacy. Medical treatments do not work equally well on all patients. Finding a responsive population on which to perform a study directly impacts the likelihood of a new therapy’s success while minimizing risk to patients who would see little or no benefit. The tool will allow clinical trials to be run virtually as computer programs in software that simulates human physiology. This technology will be valuable at all stages of treatment development: suggesting new therapies, testing for adverse effect, planning clinical trials, interpreting trial results, and predicting results when a new therapy is introduced outside of the clinical trial.  This project is focused initially on the development of a critical under-represented population: older black men with hypertension and associated diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Simulations of specific populations will allow researchers and clinicians to anticipate issues, enabling more effective treatment plans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a virtual population of 50-70 year old hypertensive African-American men with and without common cardiovascular comorbidities including congestive heart failure and type II diabetes. The virtual patients will be instantiations of a differential-algebraic model of human physiology, reflecting interactions between factors such as hormone concentrations, electrolytes, and more.  The virtual population will be generated from clinical data collected from other studies and the approach can be used for other specific populations who may be historically under-represented in trials.  This model can be used to estimate responses to clinical interventions (device and pharmaceutical therapies) to inform treatment development and further trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a wider adoption of autonomous technologies among residential buildings. This research proposes evaluating the use of advanced sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable inexpensive hardware infrastructures to control the conditions in indoor space autonomously. This technology fits well within the capacity of residential buildings. One main benefit of indoor automation is deep energy savings. The Department of Energy estimates a 5% reduction of the country's total energy bill if existing residential buildings save 25% of their energy consumption. The autonomous controller evaluated in this project has the potential to reach this goal, saving the nation up to $63 billion and the planet 284 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Alongside energy efficiency, the associated societal benefits of the proposed project can potentially save lives. The technologies may spur a higher level of security protection among many unprotected residential spaces. Additionally, tracking occupants’ habits may enable alerts to caregivers or family members in critical emergency situations. This can be beneficial for the aging population that wants to stay within the comfort of their own home.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the scientific knowledge required to approach full autonomous control in indoor spaces. The use of advanced perception sensors in buildings will be evaluated. Their rich data stream will be utilized to develop advanced algorithms for autonomous control of indoor spaces. Advances in sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms will be used to instigate technological evolution in autonomous building systems.  A proof of concept will be developed to mitigate the unique risks associated caused by applying autonomous control in indoor spaces, specifically: achieving advanced perception, self-programmability, and reliability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop low-cost, low-power, wireless sensor networks with long lifetimes for high density deployments in the field, primarily for precision agriculture. Existing solutions in the market consist of sensor modules with bulky batteries and repeaters driven by solar panels which drive up the cost.  These batteries and repeaters are infeasible for large-scale deployments. This project aims to provide sustainable solutions to increase the accuracy and efficiency of agricultural operations, while maximizing the crop yields and minimizing operational costs. The proposed sensor networks may also serve as a solution for military surveillance in the field, forest-fire prediction/mitigation, and smart highways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the use of wake-up receivers for radiofrequency (RF) communications, while also using the RF communications for moisture sensing. This use of wake-up receivers and RF-based sensing brings down the size and cost of the nodes and enables mesh networking. The research objectives of the project include both evaluation of such a network and the determination of the feasibility and reliability of wireless sensor nodes deployed inside the soil across varying soil conditions and permittivity variations. The outcome of the experiments will be a set of specifications for integrated circuits (ICs) and networks required for a dense network deployment in precision agriculture.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the enabling capabilities in applications that call for both in-air and underwater operations. The aerial-underwater drones are the first drones that can fly in air, swim in water, and transition swiftly between air and water. This project aims to equip the drones with video transmission capabilities through underwater acoustic communication so that the drone need not be tethered to operate underwater. With the enabling capabilities, the drone is useful in critical infrastructure mapping, coastal environment monitoring, emergency response, coastal surveillance, and search and rescue operations.  The underwater video transmission technology can also be applied to other platforms to extend underwater wireless and mobile internet.  The capability, in turn, has the potential to enable Internet of Underwater Things. The commercial potential of the project addresses the pain points of the existing products:  the low data rate and large form factor.  The enhanced drone will enable the hybrid vehicle to create a new market that is unserved by either Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design and prototype a small form factor acoustic communication system for aerial-underwater drones enabling them to achieve high data-rate video transmission over underwater wireless links. The intellectual merits of the proposed acoustic communication system include: 1) real-time hardware implementation of a novel MIMO (multiple-input-multiple-output) transmitter on an embedded GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) such that the system can be powered by battery and be fit in a small water-proof container, 2) real-time hardware implementation of a Turbo equalization receiver on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform to combat the huge Doppler spread and long multipath echoes of acoustic channels, 3) video transmission by a high information data rate of more than 300 kbps over underwater acoustic links, and 4) integration of the small form factor acoustic transmitter with the aerial-underwater drones without interfering with the operation of the drones.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable surgeons to see lymph nodes directly during cancer surgeries to (1) improve the quality-of-care for lung cancer, rectal cancer, and some gynecological cancers; and (2) save costs for hospitals by accelerating a time-consuming and potentially inaccurate step in cancer surgeries; (3) improve hospital accreditation performance, since lymph node number is a quality metric and many hospitals fail to meet the requirements stipulated by medical authorities. Decades of clinical evidence have shown evaluating lymph nodes is linked to higher survival rates for cancer patients. This project will develop a device to be seamlessly integrated into the existing surgical protocols and used as an accessory to existing laparoscopic towers and surgical robots. Any cancer hospital will be able to purchase this device, attach it to their existing towers or surgical robots, and improve their quality of care, surgery efficiency, and accreditation performance immediately at an affordable price.

    The proposed project addresses a difficult and common problem in surgical oncology – finding lymph nodes in cancer surgeries. Lymph nodes are critically important in the context of cancer because they are the channels for cancers to spread. However, lymph nodes are translucent in color and surrounded by fat, also translucent, making it difficult to find them with current optical systems. This project aims to develop a label-free optical imaging device to visualize lymph nodes with high contrast in real time without any injection. The goals of this project are to (1) build an accessory device attachable to a commercially available laparoscopic tower, (2) obtain optical performance testing results from animal carcasses, and (3) obtain optical performance testing results from cadaver specimens.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is related to the use of a patient’s own fat tissue for repair after injury or surgery. Removing tissue to eliminate damage through disease or trauma is universally followed by repairing tissue to restore form and function. While a broad range of materials are available, the use of a patient’s own fat for these procedures has long been considered an obvious option. Fat can be safely harvested, is rich in stem cells and growth factors and has other desirable properties, depending on the location from which it is harvested. The use of this material for surgical procedures has been inhibited by a loss of specific physical properties during the harvesting procedure. Providing a matrix to reconstruct these properties is likely to render fat grafting a more commonplace procedure. By optimizing structure and formulation of this matrix material, tissue engineering can be disrupted with an off-the-shelf option enabling harvested fat from a patient to address the hundreds of thousands of reconstructive procedures undertaken each year.

    The proposed project is based on the use of elastin-based recombinant proteins to address the current limitations of tissue repair scaffolds. The proposed technology uses highly disordered proteins to produce defined 3D structures to replicate mechanical and biological activities of the body. Using iterative design and molecular engineering, the team has generated a new class of biomaterials that are uniquely suited to meet the key criteria for a fat grafting support matrix, including injectability, in vivo phase transition to a firm solid, and biocompatibility to allow cellular viability and vascularization. This project focuses on optimization of the matrix for reconstruction procedures, including facial, breast, amputation sites and foot pad tissues. A range of materials with unique biomechanical properties are likely required to address each of the target use cases.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the loss of fresh produce due to microbial spoilage during its journey from farm to consumer. These food losses amount to $200 billion per year in direct costs worldwide, as well as an increase the environmental footprint of food production systems.  The food spoilage also causes additional potential damage to the environment and human health due to the increased use of synthetic pesticides and preservatives in an effort to prevent loss. This project aims to reduce food spoilage and the unintended consequences by providing safe, effective, and environmentally responsible methods for managing food crops post-harvest.

    The proposed project focuses on the development of controlled release systems to deliver naturally occurring, safe, anti-fungal essential oil compound (EOC) vapors to protect perishable agricultural produce from spoilage. Several experimental systems have been reported in the literature for the controlled release delivery of the EO vapors but no commercialized solutions yet exist. This highlights the importance of focused research and development needed to develop these EO delivery systems. Concurrently with controlled release systems investigations, crucial testing and modeling capabilities both in house and in an external network are also being developed. These include various volatile quantitation techniques ranging from photoionization detectors (PIDs) to gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) instruments, test beds, and dynamic and finite element modeling of transport phenomena.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of animal-free meat alternatives. Today, plant-based meats are consumed mostly by vegans and vegetarians willing to accept higher costs or different tastes compared with meat from animals. Recently, plant-based burgers and sausages have become popular, but the situation is very different for whole-cut meats. Steaks or chicken breasts, for example, have unique textures and tastes that are not yet matched by animal-free alternatives. The proposed project will improve the texture of alternative meats and provide a path to improved nutrition, taste, and aroma.

    The proposed project addresses a limitation of plant-based meats: they lack the distinct fibrous texture found in natural meats. This project advances ultrafine protein fibers with similar structure to animal muscle fibers. Project aims include ultrafine protein fiber production, development of sterile bioreactor systems to house fiber scaffolds for tissue engineering, and feasibility studies of culturing a variety of agriculturally relevant animal cells in the fiber scaffold bioreactors. The first project aim will overcome the technical hurdle of producing edible protein fibers using scalable food-safe processes. The deliverable for Aim 1 will be edible fibrous protein scaffolds with textures approximating meats. Project Aim 2 will evaluate perfusion systems to securely house scaffolds under sterile conditions conducive to cell culture. The deliverable for Aim 2 will be reusable custom tissue culture chambers. Project Aim 3 will compare a selection of animal cells based on their proliferation rates and viability when cultured in our fibrous tissue engineering scaffolds. The deliverable for Aim 3 will be animal cell-based muscle and/or fat tissues.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.

    The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop the first universal method for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of all main bodily fluids in biological stains revealed at a crime, overcoming the limitations of standard biochemical tests when identifying biological stains. The proposed technology will allow for rapid, accurate and nondestructive identification of, and distinction between, biological stains that supports the possibility of linking DNA to a bodily fluid type, thus increasing the efficiency of crime labs and assisting law enforcement personnel in the identification of suspected criminals. Commercially, this technology will be of use to the 600+ Crime Investigation Labs and 19,000+ crime scene investigators within the U.S. Department of Justice. The new approach has the potential to reduce the backlog of unprocessed DNA samples in crime labs across the U.S., while providing data that can improve the efficiency of evidence analyses.

    This analysis platform has the potential to significantly advance the field of crime scene analysis by replacing single body fluid-specific chemical tests, that are inaccurate and destructive in nature, with software that offers the novel ability to positively identify all bodily fluids in order to generate real-time decisions regarding sample content and further analyses.  The project will establish proof-of-principle through the optimization of a Raman spectroscopy method for a desktop instrument while further developing software for realistic body fluid sampling. This will allow for the development of a working prototype for crime laboratory usage.

    The proposed project will utilize state-of-the-art submicron-scale additive manufacturing\
    \ technologies to revolutionize microinjection efficacy via substantive versatility\
    \ in the design and fabrication of the needle-tip. In particular, two-photon direct\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve surgical outcomes for the more than 200,000 newborns worldwide who are born each year with congenital conditions that cause impaired growth of the skull or mandible.  These abnormalities affect breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication.  Current treatments for this fragile population are inherently complex and traumatic. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized treatment modality for craniofacial abnormalities that harnesses the body’s natural ability to regenerate bone in order to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects. While surgeons have shown the utility of DO for restoring functional discrepancies in patients born with craniofacial differences, the technique has not been widely adopted due to limitations of current DO systems, including their semi- buried design and burdensome reliance on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols. This project will further development of a novel distraction technique that will address many of these issues. Beyond the initial DO indication, eventual applications in surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder represent an eventual market potential of at least $6 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further development of a novel contactless implant and associated external driver that will significantly improve upon current distraction osteogenesis (DO) surgical apparatus by removing a principal path to device-associated complications and treatment noncompliance.  The current standard of care includes an external component that protrudes through the patient’s skin; this is required for manual expansion of the device. The device package to be developed in this proposal will eliminate the protruding component through use of an innovative design that leverages magnets instead of manual action to produce the force necessary for distraction.  This will not only remove a pathway to infection but also will resolve many of the other limitations associated with the standard of care such as the increased risk of device dislodgement, analgesic use, patient stigma, required manual operation, and treatment noncompliance.   This project will build on early proof-of-concept work to model, produce and then test a set of device prototypes, with critical dimensions no larger than standard of care, to rigorously demonstrate that they can meet key performance specs; in particular that they can provide the distraction force necessary to enable a new and entirely contactless DO procedure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid, inexpensive, and ultra-high throughput test to screen patients for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions.  The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing.  Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified.  The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of life for people who suffer from debilitating forms of paralysis by restoring their lost functionality. There are 5.4 million people in the United States who suffer from paralysis. Not only do these patients suffer from the physical pain that comes with their condition but also, they are afflicted by financial and psychological burdens. The prostheses that are being used today are either passive and affordable or active and unaffordable for the majority of these patients. Active prostheses represent the forefront of brain-computer interfaces development. Current protheses suffer from drawbacks such as constant patient training, the necessity for bulky skin electrodes, variability in electrode positioning, and limited efficacy when worn and operated by the patients themselves. This device first targets incomplete paralysis by functioning as a neural relay station that bridges the disconnect between the healthy neural section above and below the site of injury.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the limitations of current brain-computer interfaces to not only restore functionality in people with paralysis, but to recreate a real-time, seamless experience for them. Most available neural probes rely on highly invasive, sharp shanks to penetrate neural tissue.  These probes cause considerable inflammation, ultimately leading to device failure. Current devices detect signals extracellularly which leads to a  low signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction very challenging. This project will improve brain-computer interfaces by introducing nanoarchitecture to the sensing electrode in order to achieve intracellular sensing. This sensing dramatically increases the signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction considerably simpler. This device is based on an active pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor architecture which will turn neural signals into a string of ones and zeros making signal extraction considerably simpler. This process will minimize the patient-interface training time. This project will fabricate three-dimensional, nano-architected sensing electrodes with high-aspect ratio and high-density nanoneedles, mimicking the natural neural cell environment. The nanoneedles spontaneously penetrate neurons, achieve superior intracellular recording, and reduce chronic inflammation to promote device longevity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is ultimately to increase the representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) employment areas, enabling the US to meet the increasing demand for STEM workers and maintain competitiveness in the global innovation community. Factors promoting underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM often take effect early in education and extend beyond traditional classrooms settings; this solution specifically addresses the support needed by parents in order to facilitate STEM informal learning in a way that is particularly engaging for their young daughters. This proposed project, based on evidence-based research in learning in informal environments, will deliver monthly personalized informal learning plans to enable parents to catalyze positive STEM experiences for girls early in their learning journeys so that they are more likely to embrace STEM careers and better positioned to secure them in the future.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform the way young girls perceive and engage in STEM career exploration by providing a progressive playlist of STEM informal learning experiences personalized to their unique interests. This is accomplished through a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven recommender system that learns from user preferences and attributes to recommend content and learning experiences, which are meant to increase STEM confidence and interest for young girls as well as inspire their curiosity. Parents can opt to provide immediate feedback on the recommended plan that further tunes the plan to their child’s needs or swap selections with secondary recommendations. The proposed project’s objectives are to develop and test algorithmic model for sequenced recommendations, design and build the prototype application, and conduct research to determine that personalized recommendation sequences deepen and/or expand STEM knowledge and interests. To guide the development, efficacy of the recommender will be assessed by comparing results from conducting studies using human recommendations with results using the AI recommender. Once the algorithmic model is established, pre and post assessments will be conducted to assess impact of the intervention on engagement and curiosity with STEM, thereby contributing to an increase in knowledge in the field as well as a commercially applicable and timely marketplace product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be significant for helping senior caregivers optimally understand and respond to cognitive changes in older adults through a new Virtual Reality (VR) The project will result in a high-quality, effective training module for helping senior caregivers optimally understand and respond to cognitive changes in older adults. This will enhance the competence, confidence, and motivation of their nursing staff, and help reduce staff turnover. The solution will empower caregivers to effectively attend to the needs of the elderly in a way that enhances seniors’ quality-of-life and facilitates ‘aging in place,’ hence contributing towards increasing well-being among the elderly population and alleviating the societal costs of aging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge of developing VR content that effectively promotes caregiver knowledge acquisition, skill development, and motivation increases, while keeping the training experience relatively brief and efficient. Unlike simple memorization of information, positive psychological outcomes like enhanced motivation are challenging to generate. This project will strategically employ cinematic directing techniques at key points in the VR training - a new  approach to VR training. The solution leverages principles from the cognitive neuroscience of learning to deliver innovations in VR content design, analysis and delivery. Research objectives include: (1) building an engaging VR training module centered around teaching empathy and communication skills, which is enhanced with cinematic directing elements, (2) assessing the usability and feasibility of the developed content for achieving the desired outcomes in the short- and long-term, (3) building and assessing a VR training module centered around teaching observation and behavioral skills to senior caregivers, which includes embedded interactive testing elements.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the research and development of an intelligent, immersive, virtual reality (VR) platform for remote physical therapy and patient monitoring. This innovation enhances biomechanical analysis to facilitate telerehabilitation through off-the-shelf consumer VR head-mounted displays in patient homes and clinics, effectively providing a means for in-patient success metrics and full-body exercise guidance using a centralized, remote virtual platform. Such technology may have the ability to enable greater affordability, accessibility, and accuracy of physical therapy for patients and therapists alike. Patient throughput could potentially be doubled through remote visits in virtual environments and automated physical health documentation. In addition, the platform will be designed to support therapists working in marginalized communities of "medical deserts," where patients are uninsured and care is significantly limited by hospital capacity, physical distance, doctors per population, and cost. This software-as-a-service immersive physical therapy platform may reach a projected annual revenue of $2.08M USD. With remote tools and predictive physical therapy analytics, more individuals will receive access to treatment regardless of their socio-economic and demographic background.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an immersive virtual reality environment where therapists can meet their patient in a 3D virtual clinic and use the platform's tools to aid in patient evaluation. This technology addresses the shortcomings of widely used current telehealth platforms (most often videoconferencing) where therapists find it difficult to perform common evaluations such as movement abilities and balance coordination tests.  The goal of this project is to build an updated machine learning algorithm with integration on the virtual platform to enable therapists to remotely evaluate their patients with high accuracy biomechanical metrics.  The goal is to achieve remote rehabilitation of patients that is comparable to that of in-person patient rehabilitation. In addition, pilot research will be performed with healthcare organizations to assess this technology in providing patient success metrics and exercise interaction through commercial head-mounted display virtual reality systems. This technology has the potential to positively change a consumer's physical therapy experience by significantly reducing traditional clinical and insurance costs, enabling remote access for populations of low-socioeconomic backgrounds, alleviating discomfort for patients, and increasing remote recovery insights.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve job-site safety of dry-stacking installation of masonry walls without binding mortar through the use of novel Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU). The AIMU multi-component wall system combines the advantages of wood and those of concrete and is potentially applicable for mid-rise multi-family housing, a key component of affordable housing stock in the US and worldwide.  These AIMUs can be laid quickly, safely, and accurately, reducing time and labor for cost-effective construction in the US and globally.  The proposed construction platform will improve durability and offer lower lifetime costs than standard wood-based wall construction.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will further develop a construction technology using masonry blocks via dry-stacking without binding mortar.  Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU) are made of cellular lightweight concrete (CLC) and an activated adhesion. The proposed work will conduct testing to confirm the AIMU's ability to fill incursions and block irregularities, evaluate interfacial shear resistance between the interlocking features, and evaluate the interfacial adhesion activated through pressure or moisture. These fundamental properties are critical to resolving the primary barriers for translation of dry-stack masonry construction technology. The project will also demonstrate rapid outdoor dry-stacking AIMU installation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate a transformative augmented/mixed-reality smart glass to enable new immersive digital spaces. The high-performance implementation of the technology developed here will be used to augment users' perception and understanding of information and images. The remote and virtual human-to-human interactions can be enhanced through these user-natural augment/mixed-reality smart glasses beyond the smartphone. This next-generation mobile display more seamlessly interfaces with online content available today and in already established networks, ranging from online retail, gaming, sports immersion, entertainment, and social networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops smart glasses for augmented/mixed-reality digital spaces beyond the smartphone. Current smart glasses are typically based on conventional holographic or diffractive optical elements which have significant physical and performance limitations, preventing their wide-spread adoption. This project develops metasurface waveguides to achieve the key performance metrics of resolution, field-of-view, efficiency and optical element integration in augmented/mixed-reality waveguides. The metasurface waveguide is finely tuned for high performance specifications collectively, across the full color gamut, and with ease of fabrication and manufacturing scaling. The system is light weight, compact, and integrates with current light sources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the acceleration and improvement of battery manufacturing and production. Forecasting battery safety and lifetime is largely an unsolved problem in the battery industry. For manufacturers, this uncertainty increases cell cost through control measures during production as well as the precautions taken to avoid warranty events. This project proposes "data science-as-a-service" for battery formation to address both issues. By streamlining the battery formation, test, and grading process, manufacturers benefit from reduced work-in-progress (WIP) inventory waiting for final inspection, reducing facility space requirement to store WIP cell, and reducing scrap rates and increasing manufacturing yields.  The impact of these improvements will potentially enable wider spread adoption of electric vehicle applications, a major driver for battery demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing information technology infrastructure and algorithms for the prediction of battery performance during cell production. By combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with data management and manufacturing execution systems, battery cell manufacturers will greatly reduce the cost to operate and manage cell formation and test - an environment which has been largely underserved for innovation. The proposed project objectives will be achieved through two developing battery classification and prediction machine learning algorithms to improve early detection of battery failures.  Novel implementation of the proof-of-concept algorithms in battery production environments will improve the key performance indicators of these battery manufacturers.  Regression and clustering models will be used as often as possible, and the bulk of the technical work will be dedicated to the feature engineering required to elucidate changes in the change and discharge voltage profile during the first few cycles. New features will be developed by a) modelling physical processes (e.g. growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer) expected for a given cluster group or b) employing dynamical systems techniques like time-delay embeddings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of core-shell nanomaterials for sensitive detection of low-energy radioisotopes commonly used as molecular labels and tracers in quantitative biological, chemical and environmental studies. These nanomaterials can be used in place of traditional methods for measuring low-energy radioisotopes and offer greater sensitivity and better sample compatibility, while also resulting in less hazardous waste. The technology platform is expected to demonstrate several advantages over other methods in particularly challenging, information-rich areas of research, including detection of molecules within living cells. The nanomaterials platform, with further development, will also allow for the simultaneous detection of multiple compounds, an important factor in the study of complex biological samples. These advances will provide critical new tools for bioscience research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the sensitivity of a novel core-shell nanomaterial platform and develop a basic template for multi-color, multiplexed assays as well as an accompanying first-generation instrument capable of translating these advances to commercial application.  Radioisotope labels remain the gold standard in a wide range of quantitative biological, chemical and environmental studies and have played a critical role in the investigation of biological systems for almost a century. However, the low energy and short penetration depth of the most commonly used radioisotopes necessitate the use of liquid scintillation counting, solid scintillation counting or scintillation proximity assays for detection.  These assays are often incompatible with living systems, are not readily multiplexed and/or provide limited time-resolved measurement capabilities. The goals of this project are: 1) advance nanomaterial preparation to yield higher reproducibility and sensitivity signals; 2)  yield multicolor materials for simultaneous multiplexed assays; and, 3) generate a dual color scintillation counter than enables and demonstrates the utility of the platform for multiplexed assays. These goals will be accomplished by exploring a variety of scintillant fluorophores and polymer linkages in parallel with instrument design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in transportation. Lightweight metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, are particularly desirable for alloys used in automotive and aerospace components, as they could reduce the weight of components by 30%-70%. However, it is difficult to coat these materials because the high temperatures required for the coating processes weaken the alloys. This project will develop a new process to conduct the coating process at lower temperatures, offering high load capacity and enhanced wear and corrosion resistance.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes a high-pressure gas nitriding medium to enable surface reactions for coating lightweight metals, allowing for lower treatment temperatures at or below 450C. Traditional engineered surfaces are often incompatible with lightweight metals because of cracking that destroys the functional properties. Furthermore, coating these alloys presents challenges because they distort at relatively low temperatures.  This novel approach of nitriding at high pressures provides a chemically converted surface layer that prepares the surface for a secondary surface treatment, such as diamond-like carbon coatings or metal oxides, that typically fail on lightweight metals. The multi-layer approach also provides enhanced corrosion resistance by disrupting diffusion pathways of corrosive media. Combining a hard and stiff sublayer with a softer top layer with lower elastic modulus provides a multi-layer surface for lightweight metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide economic benefits to farmers and consumers as well as broader societal benefits in the U.S. and globally for many different farm operations (e.g., vegetable, flower, and herb growers as well as greenhouse operations) and farm customers.  Higher farm productivity directly benefits society by expanding the availability of nutritious, affordable food. Vegetables are vital U.S. crops in terms of food sources and farm profitability.  One of the main challenges for vegetable farmers that limits productivity and total yield is the need to grow starter plants for the vegetables in greenhouses (or to purchase them) and then transplant them into tilled soil, which is highly labor-intensive and expensive.  This system replaces that process with a system that plants pre-germinated seeds directly into the field with precision at a projected cost of 26% of the incumbent methods.  The technology is an all-electric system that reduces the use of fossil fuels used in planting 100% and is 75% lighter weight than incumbent transplanting solutions using diesel tractors. The technology also addresses the increasing scarcity of farm labor with an autonomous planting system using automatic guidance and machine learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to solve the problem of separating pre-germinated seeds in a batch of thixotropic gel such that one and only one pre-germinated seed is planted at each desired location in real-time under actual field planting conditions.  Plant scientists have proven in numerous scientific studies that planting pre-germinated seeds increases production and lowers costs.  Reliable field planters have not been successful, however. The primary research objective is to prove that an autonomous seed-singulation system combining flow controls, seed detection, active machine learning, singulation, and extrusion in real-time can meet the requirements of the field to prove commercial viability.  The project research will begin by using discrete event simulation to model the singulation process used to obtain optimal parameters for the system. The model’s output will be used to develop control algorithms and programs.  A prototype autonomous system will be developed to test the algorithms in actual field conditions. The anticipated result of this research is that the system can reliably plant one and only one seed at each desired location at least 90% of the time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (Phase I) project is to reduce human and environmental health risks posed by Harmful Algae Bloom (HABs) impacts to water resources.  Communities across the nation allocate substantial financial resources to address HABs in their water bodies as HABs can be extremely toxic. However, this ecological problem can be treated as an eco-mining opportunity because HABs are tiny eco-miners that scour, collect, and concentrate excess nutrients in water bodies. The proposed technology is an eco-sensitive mining technology designed to harvest, trap, and permanently remove these HABs, their toxins, and the often ore-grade concentration of nutrients they contain. This project will advance a technology to permanently and sustainably removing the HABs, their toxins and the excess nutrients they contain. As a fully scalable and rapidly deployable, cost-effective technology, it will rapidly resolve HAB impairments and related health risks.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed project is to target HABs, trap them through mechanical filtration, separate them through flotation, and monitor and test the effluent water for toxins. The proposed research is focused on development of remote and automatic operation capabilities to further minimize potential contact with HABs.   The process can be deployed in less than one day to surround and control small or very large areas of HABs, does not require a land-based treatment area, and does not need electricity or high capacity pumping systems to work. It can trap and remove HABs actively or passively.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology that will reduce intraoperative nerve damage using fluorescence imaging to enable surgeons to see the unseen. Intraoperative nerve injury is a major complication of surgery, affecting all specialties and often causing irreparable damage. Nerve damage occurs in ~17% of all surgeries and intraoperative nerve injuries affect 50 million patients annually worldwide, incurring undue pain, loss of function, and high costs to the healthcare system. Currently, no clinically approved technology exists to enhance intraoperative nerve recognition - surgeons rely solely on anatomical knowledge and visualization. The proposed project will finalize development of first-in-kind nerve targeted substance allowing surgeons to “cut by color” – identifying and sparing nerves more effectively to reduce these complications and the associated costs, estimated at $12.5 billion annually.

    The proposed project is focused on the development of near-infrared nerve-specific fluorophores for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) that are clinically viable for translation to human studies. Recent work has allowed modification of the base structures of the fluorophores to significantly improve brightness, solubility, and toxicity while maintaining high nerve specificity. The immediate milestones of the work proposed herein include (1) characterization of a library of benzo[c]phenoxazine small molecule derivatives with chemically tuned water solubility and quantified nerve specificity, (2) elucidation of the biological target and mechanistic understanding of nerve-specificity for the fluorophores, (3) preliminary single-dose toxicology analysis in rodents, (4) quantified pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution to determine the optimal imaging dose and time window, and (5) identification of a lead compound for clinical translation. Successful completion of the proposed work will enable selection of a lead candidate with a proven safety profile and bright, long-lasting (~1 hour) nerve-specific fluorescence for identification of buried nerve structures at up to 1 cm depths.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help fruit and tree nut growers minimize environmental impacts and improve profitability. This project will use data from implantable microchip sensors that directly measure tree hydration to develop precision models of tree and vine needs for water. These models require no hardware installation and are packaged in a user-friendly format. They will automatically provide growers with affordable advice tailored to their field and crop, enabling accurate 24/7 water status data, forecasts, and recommendations for large-scale improvements in irrigation management of tree crops.

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore plant health via continuous variation of water status or drought stress within the tissues. This data stream will be used to build dynamical models of plant water stress. The project's technical aims are to: 1) Characterize the spatial (due to plant position in the field) and temporal variations; 2) Develop a framework for iterative development of predictive models of water stress dynamics from the single-plant to the whole-field scale; and 3) Develop a system optimized for industrial modeling of the spatial and temporal dynamics of water across the full orchard or vineyard, diagnostics of high- and low-performing cultivars, irrigation blocks, and decision support to optimize field design and crop management.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a remote monitoring system that can alert caregivers to relapses in opioid use. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions billions per year.  Most tools to help people stay in recovery have low or mixed success rates. Reducing relapse saves lives and families and it reduces rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. In this proposal machine learning and pattern recognition, both forms of artificial intelligence (AI) will be aid identification of and response to potential relapse.  Benefits include conserving emergency response resources, but more importantly, improving long-term intervention success.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility of identifying and predicting a future state of craving / obsession or relapse using physiological and smartphone data, a use-case where physiologically underpinned alerts alter current care coordination workflows, and a use-case where relapse after discharge from inpatient facilities for rehabilitation can be significantly averted. Technical objectives include: 1) devise a novel data-driven framework for accurately and objectively estimating probability for relapsing into opioid use using individualized classification models; 2) Deploy and assess efficacy of model risk stratification system and monitoring dashboard at addiction treatment centers through feedback from managed care providers; 3) Assess and compare efficacy of craving vs. prediction models for just-in-time interventions vs. standard practices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to help women undergoing menopause. Most women undergo menopause, a complex biobehavioral life stage that spans one-third of their life, frequently accompanied by a complex array of symptoms affecting their health, quality of life, relationships, and productivity. The most common and disruptive menopause symptoms are hot flashes, affecting 80% of women, and persisting for up to 10-20 years, with an average duration of 7 years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate support for menopause symptom management, with very few physicians receiving adequate training in menopausal care and unable to provide appropriate care. Importantly, no current solution exists on the market to automatically measure hot flashes and other menopause symptoms over time, a critical limitation in tracking and managing women’s health, and supporting wellness across this challenging life stage. In the U.S., over 50 million women ages 45-55 have hot flashes. The global market for hot flashes is estimated at $9.5B annually and includes alternative, non-hormonal, and hormonal treatment options, with the U.S. accounting for about half-or $4.75B of the total global hot flash market. The proposed technology aims to solve key scientific, technical, and commercial challenges, to build the first novel cost-effective accurate wearable system for menopausal hot flash detection. The proposed wearable system will be an integrated key component of a broader mobile-based digital platform for managing menopause symptoms.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project  Phase I will allow the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of using wrist-based multi-sensors, common noninvasive sensors used in commercially available wearable devices, to automatically classify hot flashes, in real-time and free-living conditions (e.g., during sleep and wake, in the presence of noise signals). A combination of synthetic and real-world data will be used to achieve the aims. The system targets >90% accuracy in hot flash classification, across different behavioral, physiological and environmental conditions, against the gold standard method (expert evaluation of fluctuation in sternum skin conductance).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of improved thermal cooling solutions for mobile devices.  Cooling solutions today are often unable to meet the demands of 5G/6G telecommunications with thermal heating rates up to 10 times that of 4G technologies. Even current high performance 5G mobile phones have greatly increasing thermal loads, which, in turn, increase the external touch temperature of the smart phone and often trigger the phone to slow down its speed. The proposed technology may result in improved cooling for increased performance without limitations of performance throttling.  Enhancing thermal cooling capabilities of cutting edge mobile devices may help enable widespread adoption of 5G/6G telecommunications, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and big data applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a new passive micro-two-phase cooling based on pulsating heat pipes, which consist of a loop of microchannels in a flat plate in which oscillations of the coolant in the serpentine are generated by vapor bubbles to pump liquid and vapor to transport higher heat loads.  The design harnesses complex self-induced pulsations to better perform the work of transferring larger quantities of heat by enhancing the pulsating heat pipe's fluid motion with localized obstructions to create distributed bubble nucleation points. The same obstructions will be used to improve the micro-thermal heat transfer processes. The project introduces microfluidics to pulsating heat pipes.  The research objectives of the proposed project are to demonstrate substantial improvements in thermal performance compared to competing cooling technology (vapor chambers) at the same thin form factors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be improvement of quality of life and reduction of healthcare costs associated with tendon and ligament injuries which are notoriously difficult and slow to heal, depriving millions of Americans years of productivity. Tendon and ligament injuries are especially debilitating for the aged, the active or those with physically demanding professions. Injured ligaments (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament)  or tendons (e.g. Achilles) require months of rehabilitation and can take up to a year to heal. In the elderly, rotator cuff injuries are pernicious, prevalent and refractory to treatment. Every year in the US, $130 billion is spent on musculoskeletal injury-related medical visits, 60% of which are tendon and ligament injuries. Tendon and ligament injuries result in 288 million lost work days costing the US economy $50 billion annually. In spite of decades of effort, there has been very little improvement in either the rate or the quality of healing for these injuries. The injectable repair system proposed could reduce healing time and improve repair quality. The proposed plan to drastically reduce the cost of the raw materials through human cell engineering will make the treatment solution universally affordable.

    The proposed project will determine the feasibility of an entirely new approach to tendon and ligament repair based upon the in vivo delivery and assembly of collagen monomers into the path of force. The approach is derivative of two recent innovations that will be combined in four objectives to produce an injectable collagen-based solution designed to accelerate the repair of damaged connective tissues (i.e. ligaments and tendons) the healing of which presents a significant medical challenge. The first innovation is the use of CRISPR/CAS9 technology which will be used to accelerate the production of collagen by human fibroblasts. Objective 1 will to optimize the CRISPR process and scale it up through isolation and expansion of cells receptive to enhanced collagen production. Objective 2 will leverage the second major innovation, liquid crystal collagen processing technology, to develop a shelf stable injectable solution of highly-dense particulates that is expected to donate large amounts of collagen to injured connective tissue. Objective 3 will demonstrate that the injectable repair solution will deliver collagen to repair damage in vitro and Objective 4 will apply the approach in vivo, to demonstrate that exogenous collagen delivery can speed the repair of damaged, living tendon.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new clean energy technology that uses protein nanostructures to serve as a safe alternative, or supplement, to traditional batteries. The goal is to create power units that are 100% recyclable, preventing toxic electronic waste from accumulating in landfills, and that generate continuous power, reducing the direct and labor costs associated with replacing traditional batteries.  These costs are a significant hurdle that slows the widespread adoption and use of low-power, high-value electronics such as networks of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.  The project may also address applications, such a flammable gas sensors, where traditional batteries are not typically used to due to safety concerns.  This Phase 1 project is focused on the initial development of a safe and sustainable replacement for batteries using a technology that provides continuous renewable energy and is made with non-toxic recyclable materials.

    The intellectual merits of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing a prototype device that uses protein nanostructures to generate clean power by means of a new method of energy harvesting that leverages environmental humidity. The research objectives are to (i) fabricate standardized, reliable and reproducible testbed devices; (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of commercial-scale production of a range of protein nanostructures; and (iii) to evaluate these protein nanostructures using our testbed devices. The testbed prototype devices will be made using commercially scalable processes. Devices made using the protein nanostructures will be evaluated using electrochemical and electronic characterization techniques.  The goals of the project are to successfully fabricate thin-film power generation devices, prove commercial-scale production of protein nanostructures, evaluate the power output, and demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of power generation from the devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a microfluidic assay for applications related to drug discovery/screening, personalized medicine, drug toxicity assessment, evaluation of patient clinical status, and predicting patient-specific responses to certain therapies. The proposed platforms allow drug testing under specific physiological conditions to investigate how certain drugs or drug combinations might affect specific cells. Currently available platforms are extremely complex and rely on costly, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and low-throughput fabrication methods, hampering the translation potential of such systems into a commercial setting. Moreover, standardization and analytic validation of such platforms are needed for reproducible and reliable sample testing, facilitating the process of regulatory approval. This project will significantly help standardize and validate a high-throughput platform for deployment at scale. This project will help reduce operational costs for preclinical drug discovery/screening studies and lower the drug failure rate, as patient-specific testing will be possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a standardized and validated microfluidic platform integrated with human endothelial cells for drug discovery/screening purposes. Since the traditional in vivo and in vitro techniques that are employed in the preclinical stage of drug development are extremely costly, labor intensive, time-consuming, and can still lead to high failure rates, there is an urgent need for physiologically relevant in vitro assays for preclinical assessment of new drug candidates, particularly in the cardiovascular disease and blood disorders spaces. Microfluidic platforms allow for precise control of gas and flow conditions at a size scale equivalent to that of human microvasculature and offer physiologically relevant vascularized environments for in vitro testing. To ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the assay, research objectives include a comprehensive and systematic approach to standardize the culture and activation of endothelial cells under physiologic flow conditions. Furthermore, standardized both short-term and long-term activation of endothelial cells via disease specific activators (e.g., heme, TNF-α, etc.) will be established to better mimic in vivo conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a platform to isolate cells based on their biophysical properties. The platform will help isolate cells that are not abundant and enable study of their role in biological function and diseases such as cancer. Specifically, a single chip platform will carry out sample preparation, manipulation, and monitoring, greatly reducing the sample handling steps and thereby ensuring the maintenance of cell viability and improvement in sample consistency. This recovered sample is essential for the development of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine and cancer management.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an electrically functional microfluidic sample manipulation platform for phenotype-selective recovery of cells, based on their biophysical attributes that allow discrimination between distinct electrophysiological properties for the cells of interest within the sample media. Specifically, microfluidic designs will be developed to swap cells from complex biological matrices into an optimized buffer for enabling cell manipulation, and the instrumentation will be developed for on-chip monitoring of the sample during various stages of the phenotype-selective cell recovery process. The designs will be optimized for enhanced levels of selection purity, while maintaining high cell collection efficiencies, so that the recovered sample is enriched for cell phenotypes of interest.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will be a safe endovascular detoxification device for treatment of numerous acute and chronic pathologies. The proposed device could aid in the treatment of severe autoimmune disease patients and organ transplant patients, and furthermore, would clear up a path for safe use of viral gene therapy in the general population. It has the potential to decrease mortality and reduce the burden on the global healthcare expenditure for the widespread antibody-mediated pathological conditions. There is a societal need for a safe, cost-effective, fast-acting, widely-accessible, and easy-to-use system capable of rapid blood detoxification for treatment of pathological conditions. The markets targeted by the proposed device include the multibillion-dollar autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and viral gene therapy markets, with the largest market opportunity being the global autoimmune disease therapeutics market that is expected to reach $153.3 billion by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development an endovascular blood IgG detoxification platform for rapid elimination of IgG antibodies for treatment of IgG-driven pathological conditions.  Antibody-mediated immune response has been a key factor responsible for numerous acute and chronic pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejections, immune-mediated rejection in viral gene therapy. Currently, therapeutic apheresis and potent systemic immunosuppressives have been the main forms of management for IgG-driven pathologies. However, these forms of treatments are not patient-friendly, and in many cases do more harm than good. The proposed endovascular blood IgG detoxification device could potentially provide safe and rapid elimination of circulating IgGs, eliminating the need for unfavorable or in cases harmful treatments such as therapeutic apheresis or potent systemic immunosuppressives. The device will be comprehensively investigated in an ex vivo venous simulation system, testing its hemocompatibility, IgG-elimination capacity, and the influence of different parameters including rod material, rod diameter, rod length, flow rate, and therapeutic protein concentration. Furthermore, the safety, durability, immune response, and therapeutic efficacy of the device will be investigated in a lethal IgG-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) model in minipigs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and age-related lung conditions. Reliable detection of these diseases at an early stage has the potential for significantly improving disease outcomes, by reducing the health impact of lung diseases and the costs associated with the treatment. Briefly, 14 million Americans are currently estimated to have Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)-diagnosed COPD, while >16 million subjects are expected to have PFT-undiagnosed COPD leading to the first or initial diagnosis at the severe stages. Currently no accurate and early lung health assessments exist, representing a vital healthcare gap - especially for young children, elderly and subjects with chronic conditions, as lung diagnostics such as PFT require patient compliance and CT, PET etc., have significant risk for these subjects. With >16 million cases of PFT-undiagnosed COPD in the United States alone, a new lung health screening diagnostic test will address the “invisible” epidemic of COPD and help monitor impact of exposure to first- and secondhand- smoke, e-cig vapors and air pollutants. Early more frequent lung health screening will allow timely intervention and limit significant health care costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accelerate development and commercialization of a lung health multiplex point of care test (xPOCT) for early diagnosis and intervention of COPD. The POCT is supported by proof-of-concept pre-clinical data and human subject validation of a prognostic biomarker for delivering on first-in-class RAPID home-based and POC Lung Health Diagnostics (LHDx) for predicting initiation and progression of COPD-emphysema. The goal is to develop an effective, non-invasive and rapid LHDx for early more frequent screening and diagnosis of COPD-emphysema, commonly missed by current standard-of-care diagnostics. This project has the following objectives: (1) prototype engineering and standardization of the specificity and sensitivity of the home-based and POC LHDx platform technology; (2) validation of the diagnostic assay specificity and sensitivity for evaluating disease prognosis; and (3) development of a lab validation assay with custom software for disease severity analysis and initiate regulatory approval for commercialization of the home-based RAPID and POC LHDx. The Phase I project will address the unmet need for identification of individuals that are at-risk and highly susceptible to developing COPD for prognosis-based early intervention. The  outcome would be development of a novel, non-invasive LHDx for quantifying COPD-emphysema initiation and progression for tailored intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that poisoning by prescription drugs affects over one million people annually and is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Other than opioids, prescribed benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants are the most common causes of accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. Drug testing plays a central role in the detection and management of poisoned patients, and the ability to rapidly identify the cause and institute prompt targeted treatment has the potential to reduce morbidity and save lives. Currently, screening of blood and other biological fluids for toxic drug levels requires specimen processing, taking hours or days to obtain results from commercial laboratories. Immediate, accurate, low-cost testing for urgent care in the ambulance or emergency room will improve outcomes for the rapid diagnosis and care of patients after accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. The biosensor device and drug testing methods described in this project can be performed for low cost at the first point of contact and are scalable for rapid commercial and clinical adoption into a global drug screening market valued at $1.1 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a new solid-state biosensor device reporting real-time and accurate quantification of toxic drug levels in the blood using inexpensive, disposable test strips similar to a diabetes glucometer or from saliva like a sublingual electronic thermometer. Current drug toxicity assays use specialized laboratory methods that require blood sample processing and can take hours to days to obtain results. Biosensors are an interface between biology and electronics that convert specific chemical information into measurable electronic signals (e.g. a glucometer). The three specific outcomes of this project will be; 1) a handheld medical device providing accurate and real-time measurement of blood levels of all classes of antipsychotic, neuroleptic, and anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use, and other common drugs of abuse, from a drop of blood or saliva, 2) validation of the accuracy of the biosensor for target drugs relative to current laboratory analysis methods (e.g., mass spectroscopy), and 3) demonstration that the biosensor can distinguish between classes of medications, drugs of abuse, and potential clinical interferents in blood using specific analytical methods and modifiable biosensor coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the challenges posed to the US healthcare system resulting from neurologic disease and trauma impacting 100+ million patients in the US alone and associated costs in excess of $1.3 trillion, driven by a lack of diagnostic tools detecting the onset of disease before it affects neuronal tissue beyond repair. Neurologic biomarkers represent a promising new approach to this challenge, comprising 10% of the $53 billion global biomarker market and growing at a 14.5% compound annual growth rate. This Phase I project aims to provide neurologic biomarker-based low-cost blood testing products for research and patient care, providing novel diagnostic information. It is anticipated that changes from baselines resulting from concussions, onset of dementia, brain tumors or neurologic disease, can be detected early, thereby allowing for timely intervention.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is based on the finding that specific immune cells (phagocytes) in the peripheral blood can serve as diagnostic indicators of brain health. It is well established that these cells are recruited to the injured or diseased brain in order to clear the cellular debris resulting from the inflammatory response. While current methods seek to identify neurologic biomarkers in blood serum, where they are very dilute and difficult to detect, this project aims to make use of the finding that debris-loaded cells can reenter the blood stream.  The proposed project will develop technologies and instrumentation to capture and quantify these phagocytes from small amounts of blood (e.g. finger prick), to identify the specific cell types involved, and assay their brain-specific biomarker content. Since the normal protein turnover affects the brain as well, blood samples from cognitively normal donors will be tested to establish a baseline concentration of these biomarker-carrying phagocytes and their cargo.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand access to quality health care for underserved populations.  The proposed project develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant, women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example. The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips. Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules, such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the paper lateral flow strips.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project advances the translation of hydrogen technologies in heavy duty and ultra-duty applications. The hydrogen economy could generate an estimated $2.5 T in economic value in the manufacturing, transportation, energy storage, and building energy, sectors.  Current membranes that require high humidity levels and low temperatures for operation complicates fuel cell thermal and water management components in heavy duty fuel cell systems. The proposed solution advances the development of a new membrane serving as a drop-in replacement to enable low humidity and elevated operating temperatures.

    This SBIR Phase I project will use porous polymer supports to translate a nanocomposite material that exhibits both low humidity and elevated temperature proton conductivity into a standardized solution for a proton exchange membranes. Furthermore, the composite materials will be added at high volume fractions to confer additional benefits in mechanical stability and lower gas permeability. The project activities include material translation into supported membranes, membrane composite formulation optimization, measurements of key membrane properties, and demonstration in a fuel cell stack. If successful, the project would yield new proton exchange membranes that enable operation under low humidity – elevated temperature conditions to simplify fuel cell systems while extending system durability.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide near-real time information of changes in the spatial extent (flood mapping) and flow of rivers (water resource management) to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Effective management of water resources and associated risks has become a major challenge for society. Floods are common disasters around the world and droughts lead to major disruptions to economies and a loss of life. This project will leverage artificial intelligence, and peta-bytes of satellite imagery to implement a physics guided data-intensive approach for advancing global hydrological modeling. The project will provide efficient and accurate imagery-derived observations of water dynamics in rivers at relatively low computational cost (compared with ground sensors) in a user-friendly web environment. This will be a significant step towards improving the modelling and forecasting of water resources around the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop advanced artificial intelligence techniques to track surface water changes in rivers across the globe using vast amounts of satellite imagery. While conventional artificial intelligence techniques are purely driven by data, the proposed technology incorporates known physical laws into these algorithms. This physics guided approach makes these techniques much more robust to atmospheric disturbances (clouds, shadows, haze, etc.), and enables synergistic use of imagery datasets at different resolutions which are two major issues with satellite imagery analysis. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty quantification techniques will enable domain experts to incorporate their local knowledge about river flows into the framework to refine results.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to help applications of augmented reality, location-based search, and real-time live mapping of the world, and to build a digital twin of the earth. Event information is dynamic and hyperlocal. Thus it is important to ground the location and time of events to real GPS coordinates and universal time. This creates technical challenges of entity disambiguation and resolution, and real-time processing event information to reflect last-minute changes. The proposed natural language grounding work also helps create a mirrorworld with information interlinked between the virtual internet and physical spaces and events.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the first to investigate neural language model pre-training over semi-structured hypertext on a web scale (55TB of compressed data monthly). This will greatly accelerate understanding of noisy web text, while the majority of research to date has been conducted on clean plain text only. This project will also attack the challenge of machine reading with document-level annotations in a semi-supervised fashion, while the predominance of study has been carried out with more precise word-level annotation in a fully supervised way. The technical goal of this project is to create a scalable infrastructure that allows quick iterations of mining web scale data, and an ensemble of algorithms that are adapted to learning structured information over hypertext. It is an unsolved challenge for most small businesses that in the past only the internet giants have attempted. The resulting machine learning algorithms will be capable of interpreting semi-structured web data, in contrast to typical structured annotation to understand hypertext.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the array of new opportunities it creates for expanding uses of machine intelligence. By providing an efficient way to transform deep learning models to best fit the constraints on end devices and real-time applications, this project will shorten the time to market for artificial intelligence applications by orders of magnitude, and hence significantly accelerate the development and deployment of intelligent software in health, commerce, financial, defense, social networks, and many other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the important barriers for efficient development of real-time Artificial Intelligence applications on end devices (smartphones, drones, etc.). It does this through a breakthrough technology, compression-compilation co-design. Compression and compilation are the two key steps in fitting a deep learning model on a hardware for efficient execution. Model compression reduces the size of deep learning models; compilation generates executable codes from a given deep learning model. The principle of compression-compilation co-design is to design the two components for AI in a hand-in-hand manner. The technology uses a novel approach to synergize a set of novel model compression methods with compression-aware code compilation techniques. The result is a technology that achieves several-fold higher artificial intelligence model compression rates over the state of the art, several times faster speed, better energy efficiency, and satisfying accuracy.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be improved market efficiency and greater competition in financial services and adjacent industries.  Currently, these sectors are dominated by large firms that have the resources to create and exploit asymmetric information advantages over smaller firms.  A key reason for this asymmetry is that company information – the basis for building high-quality, detailed financial models – can be prohibitively expensive to surface, not because it is unavailable, but because it is reported in non-standardized ways and therefore difficult to extract and make actionable.  To do so systematically and industry-wide requires thousands of man-hours per year of manually sifting through millions of documents, a cost that only the largest firms in the world can bear.  Automating the extraction of such information and making it both widely available and easily accessible helps to level the playing field for small firms while simultaneously improving the speed and quality of decision-making – at a lower total cost – for large firms.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a machine learning platform for automatically extracting data from a collection of financial documents.  The platform will take advantage of recent advances in natural language processing model architectures, but nonetheless faces the challenges of (a) achieving and maintaining a high level of accuracy, even as document text volume, and thus semantic variation, grows; and (b) generating sufficient labeled training data in a cost-effective way.  This project addresses these dual challenges with a novel framework for continuous model training based on recent meta-learning techniques.  Such an approach to supervised learning can substantially accelerate model improvement and simultaneously drive down training costs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is relevant to US national priorities. For example, potential applications of quantum computing include defense-related tasks such as aircraft and flight maneuver identification. Other promising quantum applications are prevalent in logistics problems and can impact American competitiveness in manufacturing. In addition, longer term horizons of quantum computing such as better fertilizer production would dramatically reduce global energy expenditures. The efficiency gains from the proposed end-to-end compilation techniques will address these objectives. The scientific advances funded by this research will enable quantum computing to be applied to a wider range of problems than previously envisioned.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the intellectual merit of accelerating the timeline for practical quantum computing. By achieving significant efficiency gains from cross-layer optimization spanning the full quantum stack, practical applications will be executable sooner than otherwise possible. The Phase I research will validate that three proposed quantum techniques outperform the state-of-art found in prevailing quantum research. This work will advance understanding of the ultimate potential and limits of near-term quantum computing. To date, there is still no consensus whether non-error-corrected quantum computers will ever outperform classical computers. To address this overarching research question, the proposed R&D will undertake the technical challenge of end-to-end compilation, which tailors execution of quantum applications to the underlying hardware. This requires eschewing traditional abstraction barriers which are convenient but incur efficiency losses due to indirection. Instead, the proposed work will take as direct a path as possible from the end-user application down to the underlying quantum hardware. Doing so will reveal the fundamental capacity of noisy quantum computers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project falls within the larger scope of expanding artificial intelligence (AI) methods into health care applications. The application is focused on image guided endovascular surgical procedures for intracranial aneurysms (IA), which may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most devastating type of hemorrhagic stroke. The current trends in treatment of aneurysms show that endovascular approach has become the mainstay procedure due to reduced surgical complications when compared with open skull surgery. Despite tremendous technological advances in devices and surgical instrumentation, as many as 30% of these lesions are not completely healed after the first surgical intervention, exposing patients to additional risks for complications due to multiple surgical procedures. The AI autonomous solution developed in this project will be the one of the first applications that provides intraoperative prognosis for six-month healing of an aneurysm after each surgical step to allow surgical adjustments, reducing the risk for ruptures and re-treatments from 30% to an estimated 5% and creating savings for the $65,000 in retreatments (roughly $1.95 B annually in the U.S.).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will aim to develop a comprehensive and autonomous AI method that will provide intraoperative prognosis of complete healing for an IA at six months. In current clinical practice, neuro-interventionalists cannot guarantee successful healing of intracranial aneurysms immediately post-device placement. Treated patients have to wait a minimum of 3-6 months before their aneurysm is reassessed on medical imaging and the clinician decides if re-treatment is needed. During this critical time, patients are still at risk of rupture. In addition, re-treatments have higher risk to the patient as well as bear a financial burden on hospitals and insurance companies. The proposed algorithms will be fully integrated with surgical equipment and will allow dynamic angiographic analysis to derive physics-based parameters related to the nature of blood flow inside the aneurysm sac. These parameters are combined with a machine learning algorithm to provide a prediction as to whether the treatment is sufficient for a full healing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable novel binary code AI applications for cybersecurity, by providing a fast and accurate method to reverse-engineer executable code. Current solutions are slow and inaccurate, and the volume of code analyzed by cybersecurity applications is huge.  Cybersecurity companies either deploy tremendous computing resources to handle huge volumes of code or only extract superficial features from code for AI models, making those solutions extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  The proposed solution will not only save computing resources but will allow for improved solutions by extracting complex features from executable code and applying more advanced AI models.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides an innovative disassembly solution for binary code. The lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. The proposed solution combines state-of-the-art binary analysis techniques and newly emerging deep learning techniques to build a fast and accurate disassembler.  The proposed solution utilizes GPU technology to accelerate the disassembly process.  The final disassembly is expected to be over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art disassemblers, while achieving the same or better accuracy.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the economics of farming. Machines with good computer perception of plant geometry can implement farming practices that reduce the use of pesticides, fertilizer, water, and fuel. This will increase farm efficiency and provide long-term benefits to the environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new algorithms for estimation of plant structure from images. This is challenging because agricultural fields are often densely packed with plants, such that portions of each plant are hidden from view. Existing methods can estimate missing geometry of man-made objects from obstructed views, but plants are considerably more difficult, due to the complexity, variability, and visual ambiguity of their geometry. The project will aim to achieve levels of detail and accuracy not previously attained in plant imaging. To reach this goal, the project will use rapid iterations of field data collection, algorithm development, and field testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to extend advanced encapsulation technologies to allow successful delivery of new biological treatments on the skin.  Research has proven the beneficial effects of applying living probiotics directly to skin, and there are emerging needs to deliver such probiotics alive in topical creams. However, applications of biologics are currently limited because of the challenges associated with its inactivation/decomposition during production, transport, storage, which often lead to low delivery efficacy and constraints in product type. Additionally, current biologic-containing products often have short shelf-life and high refrigeration cost. This project will create a robust encapsulation platform tailored toward delivering living probiotics in topical skin formulations featuring long storage capabilities, while providing critical methods for prospective biologic-related applications. This project will enable novel biologic therapeutic applications.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop solutions to prolong probiotics’ survival in complex water-oil skin formulations utilizing microencapsulation technology.  Multiple studies have validated the advantageous effect of active probiotics for skin health; however, development of topical probiotic products remains a great challenge as the probiotics must remain active and viable within formulations during long storage periods. To mitigate such challenges, this proposal will focus on integrity-enhanced microstructures that can encase, immobilize and sustain living-probiotic cells in a highly moisturized environment. Different types of probiotic-enriched skin moisturizer formulations will be developed, and the viability and stability of probiotics will be studied under accelerated storage conditions. Specifically, this project will improve the stability and viability of probiotics in skincare formulations by carrying out detailed analysis on: (1) the processing parameters and operating temperatures to encase probiotics; (2) developing formulations using suitable probiotic-friendly ingredients; (3) the stabilities of the microencapsulation microstructures and probiotic compatibility; (4) probiotic viabilities stored under different pH and temperature conditions; (5) probiotics’ interaction with antimicrobial agents; and (6) the release and delivery of probiotics from the formulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable the reuse of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to create lower-cost, more sustainable energy storage systems on a large scale. The costs of renewable energy have declined dramatically, and more than one-third of Americans now live in a community committed to procuring 100% renewable or low-carbon electricity. However, low-cost energy storage is key to achievement of these bold goals and to the growth of clean energy jobs. To meet this need while mitigating dependence on foreign miners of scarce battery materials, hard-to-recycle EV battery waste may be given a “second life” in lower-cost, more sustainable energy storage systems. However, second-life batteries must be safe, reliable, and significantly cheaper than new battery alternatives to gain traction. The cost advantage and performance of second-life batteries hinges on fast and accurate battery testing. Successful development of the proposed rapid used battery testing system would enable widespread deployment of second-life batteries at 30% to 70% lower cost than new battery alternatives. As a result, the innovation has the potential to enhance the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of the nation’s energy system.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to dramatically reduce the time required to accurately measure the state of health (SoH) of used EV batteries. Existing methods either require several hours to fully charge and discharge batteries or highly granular data on historical battery usage. The objective of the proposed research and development effort is to measure the SoH of used EV batteries at any state of charge (SoC) with less than 2% error in less than 75 seconds. The proposed method involves training neural networks to recognize subtle patterns in used batteries’ responses to brief pulses of electric current and ultrasound. The team has collected promising preliminary data, which suggest the test methodology produces highly accurate SoH estimates for batteries at a specific SoC. To maximize the accuracy and robustness of SoH predictions for batteries at any SoC, the team will compare various profiles of electric current and ultrasonic pulses, expand its neural network training datasets, and refine the architecture of its neural networks. By dramatically reducing used battery test time and expense, this innovation will reduce the cost of safely repurposing used EV batteries in second-life energy storage systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to facilitate secure transactions.  The proposed project allows business transactions without the fear of cybercrime.  The expected cost reductions will enable a company to safely engage with individuals and families who cannot afford commonly available cybersecurity solutions. The proposed blockchain process will improve security and resilience of critical infrastructure including energy, transportation, finance, telecommunications, and manufacturing, as well as enabling true smart cities and installations of the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a multi-segment and multipath design for substantial transactional improvement and reduction in required computing resources. Computing resources required in blockchain usage primarily involve the searching of the complete blockchain for the appropriate record. The proposed solution eliminates the required search of the complete blockchain by segmenting the blockchain to search smaller segments.  This project will research, develop and implement a method for improving the current state of knowledge with resulting performance improvement of blockchain transactions without compromising the fidelity of the transaction, thereby eliminating the need for a blockchain Proof of Work Consensus Model. The project will research several blockchains as well as the consensus and non-consensus models for final implementation. Validation includes a baseline transaction measurement for each of the chosen blockchains identified before any modifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting tools to improve forecast accuracy and strengthen power grid resiliency. The United States is currently transitioning to an increasingly renewable energy-based economy. The availability of the leading renewable sources, solar and wind, vary with weather, making forecasts critical to plan for daily plant and energy grid operations. When weather forecasts are wrong, the grid suffers inefficiencies, causing power prices to spike and hurt consumers. Worldwide, national weather agencies continually release weather data to the public. This project demonstrates the feasibility of improving weather forecasting by collecting, organizing, and leveraging large public weather datasets in real-time. AI will sort through these data to deliver advanced weather insights to the energy industry as well as other commercial consumers requiring high fidelity forecasts. These insights will allow energy market participants to anticipate market movements, correct inefficiencies, and lead to a more resilient energy grid and power distribution.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance the state of weather forecasting by augmenting physics-based atmospheric models with artificial intelligence. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a toolkit of algorithms that in real-time applies AI to detect errors in weather forecasts and uses machine learning accessing historical forecasts to provide error correction. The project’s objectives are 1) development of a database of historical wind forecast data corresponding to major Texas wind farm sites; 2) training and validation of an ensemble of AI algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, random forests, and probabilistic analogs, that detect errors in historical forecast data; and 3) development of software that ingests publicly available weather forecasts from physics-based models, applies AI algorithms, and delivers advanced weather forecast insights in real-time. This research will provide feasibility that AI algorithms can easily integrate with high-fidelity models to complement the existing weather forecasting infrastructure. The technology developed in this project is a general environmental forecasting framework that demonstrates the use of AI/ML applications to a broad set of weather-dependent scientific and engineering challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a new manufacturing process for on-chip lasers for silicon photonics using printed nanomaterial inks. The difficulty of a scalable method for fabricating on-chip, multi-color lasers is a major challenge for the silicon photonics market. Specifically, today's standard manufacturing of photonic chips does not include on-chip lasers. Without integration of laser engines to drive the circuits, the market potential of light chips is constrained by design and price. The technology developed here can allow foundries to mass produce chips with lasers and open multiple new markets for silicon photonics including wearable photonic sensors, optical data transfer, autonomous vehicle light detection and ranging, quantum information, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and healthcare applications such as immunoassay tests and medical imaging.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops on-chip embedded lasers to enable fully functional silicon photonic chip manufacturing. Currently, the laser solutions being employed in silicon photonics include bonded lasers and heterogeneous integration. The system integrators that assemble silicon photonics modules rely on often cumbersome methods of gluing individual lasers to silicon chips, keeping costs high and throughput well below desired levels. The photonic inks developed here will overcome this challenge by enabling an in-foundry laser solution via wafer-scale additive manufacturing. The photonic ink emits broad-spectrum light covering the visible to the near-infrared range and can be tailored to emit at specific wavelength bands relevant to different markets by altering the number of atomic layers. The goals of this Phase I project are to demonstrate electroluminescence from a p-n junction made from doped, few-layer nanomaterials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve quality control in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The compressed tablet is the most popular pharmaceutical dosage form in use worldwide. Despite its well-established manufacturing processes, issues with tablet quality are frequent. Issues in its design and manufacturing have the potential to make significant medical and financial impacts as failures in quality may result in harm to patients, product recalls, and medicine shortages. The proposed Ultrasonic Measurement Instrument (UMI) unit will substantially shorten drug tablet design/development cycles and detect/identify manufacturing and quality problems before release. Its utilization in modern continuous manufacturing lines will minimize the risk of defective tablet production/disposition and costly product recalls/disposals. The UMI unit will lead to two distinct solutions: (i) a real-time preventive quality monitoring device for continuous manufacturing production line and (ii) a stand-alone laboratory equipment for characterizing tablet physical properties. The target users for our UMI-based products include pharmaceutical manufacturers; equipment providers; generic drug manufacturers; R&D groups and drug development teams in corporations and universities; and compounding pharmacies.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project and its ultrasonic approach have several critical advantages over the competing quality assessment and monitoring technologies for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Unlike other detection techniques, ultrasound directly interacts with the mass density, material elasticity/viscoelasticity, defects/cracks, and inhomogeneities of a medium and piezoelectric transducers are the most sensitive devices for transient strain sensing. Operating in MHz frequency, ultrasonic techniques make rapid (micro-seconds scale) measurements at relevant wavelengths for tablet and defect sizes (micrometer to millimeter scales). Challenges to be addressed include: (i) existing wave propagation models for viscoelastic tablet materials with microstructures are inadequate for accurate materials characterization/valuation with ultrasound, and (ii) a precise handling and positioning apparatus for tablets is needed, as for machine learning and data analytics/mining, the repeatable acquisition and processing of large data sets are required. The main outcome of the project is a proof-of-concept testing/measurement unit (UMI) with a precise tablet handling sub-system and its accompanying mathematical algorithms for the formation of large data sets.

    \ Phase I project is to establish a proof-of-concept for an oncological medical\
    \ device that will be used as an adjunct treatment for pancreatic cancer (PC).\
    \ PC is one of the lethal forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related\
    \ death in the US. Chemotherapy is the first-line standard treatment for cancer\
    \ therapy. The medications used during chemotherapy are administered through an\
    \ intravenous infusion (IV), pill, or injection. Once these medications enter\
    \ the bloodstream, they destroy the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. The\
    \ most common side effects for patients are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and decreased\
    \ immunity leading to a low quality of life. Our prototype aims to reduce chemotherapy\
    \ side effects and the need for in-hospital chemotherapy administration, significantly\
    \ reducing healthcare costs. The proposed innovative technology offers an alternative\
    \ to direct surgical resection in the sensitive areas surrounding the pancreas.\
    \ This treatment will extend the number of patients who can benefit from surgery\
    \ and increase the overall success of surgeries primarily by preventing local\
    \ relapse. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lay\
    \ the essential foundation for understanding the medical device product's physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a \"silent\" disease\
    \ because it is diagnosed at a much later stage when cancer has already metastasized.\
    \ One of the significant challenges associated with PC treatment is the standard\
    \ administration techniques (e.g., intravenous injection, oral administration)\
    \ cannot efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of the drug to the tumor\
    \ site because of the pancreas' anatomy. The innovative technology used in this\
    \ prototype device will render it as an implantable, biodegradable, drug-eluting\
    \ product allowing for spatio-temporal control and delivery of various active\
    \ pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly to the tumor site. Further, reductions\
    \ in global toxicity and access to traditionally unresectable areas may enable\
    \ higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents than could be tolerated by\
    \ systemic administration, significantly altering the treatment landscape. This\
    \ project will address the following four technical challenges related to the\
    \ formulation and physical characteristics of the prototype, which will determine\
    \ its release profile and the 3D printing mechanism, and its impact on the device's\
    \ quality. The research and development routes that are being pursued include\
    \ (1) assessment of prototype mechanical profile, starting with one API of interest\
    \ (2) assessment of different polymer compositions and how they impact the flow\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to enable doctors to treat previously untreatable cancerous tumors through the development of a smart surgical needle. There are many clinical situations in which a patient cannot receive curative surgery because of the proximity of the tumor to critical anatomy; for example, the central bile duct in liver cancer. In these cases, patients are forced to decide between a number of non-curative treatments that have poor outcomes and significant side effects. Innovation in early-stage tumor treatments will expand treatment options to under-served communities and patient populations. Liver cancer, for example, disproportionately affects Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-American populations in the US, with as many as 30% to 66% patients never receiving any treatment. One reason is that surgical treatments require significant operating room infrastructure (for example, three-dimensional medical imaging) to provide high-quality outcomes; unfortunately these facilities are concentrated in research hospitals and access is not widespread. The technology developed here will address these tumors, and will apply to the more than 600,000 patients in the US yearly that suffer from cancers of the liver, kidney, lung, and breast.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of small-size sensors to transform ablation technology into a first-line treatment for all cancerous tumors. By placing imaging sensors onto the tip of a needle, the device can overcome performance limits encountered when using traditional image guidance. This increased performance, in combination with real-time image analysis, can sense temperature variation in a variety of tissues. The ability to sense temperature variation will be combined with needle tip-based energy delivery to provide an all-in-one closed loop ablation device, with the capability to treat previously untreatable tumors.  This project will demonstrate the application of deep-learning techniques, combined with physics based simulations, to enable precision ablation monitoring.  Subsequently the ablation monitoring will be combined with ablation control to test the feasibility of precise closed-loop ablation in ex vivo tissue with sufficient accuracy for future clinical implementation. This foundational work will then guide the development of the desired needle probe embodiment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the identification of treatments for vascular leak disorders. Uncontrolled vascular leak disorders are common pathological processes that lead to tissue damage across multiple organs and over 60 clinical conditions. Currently, there are no drug-based therapies that address vascular leaks. Available solutions are focused on providing supportive care or decreasing inflammation, without addressing the underlying mechanism. This project is proposing a new approach to repair vascular leaks as a therapeutic intervention. By establishing the first drug discovery workflow for the identification of small molecules that repair vascular leakage, this project will enable the development of a pipeline of drugs for multiple conditions. The first condition targeted will be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which accounts for 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is the leading cause of mortality in ICU. Globally, it affects more than 3 million patients yearly. The proposed solution will decrease the number of deaths and the costs for ICU.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new structure-based drug screening platform designed to identify small molecules that activate the molecular pathways responsible for repairing vascular leakage. The proposed platform consists of a unique combination of novel machine learning methods for ligand-binding site prediction, fast docking algorithm capable of screening ultra-large (over a billion molecule) compound libraries with targeted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profile within minutes (5,000 compounds/second). The AI-guided docking approach is combined with in vitro high-throughput assays measuring the mechanisms of vascular leak in a physiologically relevant microenvironment of human tissues to select candidates targeting vascular leak disorders. In this project, the steps of this tiered workflow will be validated and applied to the first target, leading to the identification of a set of new drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project is to  enable large-scale integration of photonic and electronic components in computing and communications systems. Optical computing represents the a potential path forward in the expansion of computing power.  Hybrid devices utilizing organic electro-optic (OEO) materials are a potential enabling technology for electronic-photonic digital computing (EPDC), with further applications in telecommunications, quantum computing, and quantum networking. Compared to existing silicon photonics and microwave photonics systems, hybrid electro-optics deliver critical performance enhancements, with potential for improved capabilities and lower operating costs for computing and 5G telecommunications systems. The growth of EPDC will also reduce power consumption and carbon footprints of high-performance computing and cloud computing, especially intensive applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, where operations are particularly conducive to being performed optically.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project directly addresses key challenges in bringing high-performance hybrid organic electro-optic (OEO) components capable of direct integration with conventional silicon-based semiconductor technologies to market.  Hybrid devices utilizing OEO materials have demonstrated significant advantages in speed, size, and power consumption compared to existing technologies. However, rigorous definition of materials properties, optimization of long-term thermal and photostability, and ability to translate new OEO material concepts into commercial materials are essential for establishing market viability. This project includes evaluating stability and encapsulation techniques to ensure long-term reliability and commercial-scale synthesis of a next-generation material for commercial applications, translating recent academic developments from theory aided design into a commercial supply chain.  These results will de-risk adoption of hybrid OEO-based technologies and enable a wider range of applications via higher performance and better understanding of thermal constraints and encapsulation requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project improves outcomes following orthopedic ligament and tendon reconstruction. More than 1 million surgeries to repair torn ligaments and tendons are performed in the United States annually. However, the failure rates are reported to be as high as 25% and the majority of failures are attributed to a technical error, which costs the US healthcare system $2.5 billion each year. Stitching has been identified as a critical, technically complex step in the surgery that, if improved, can be a way to reduce the incidence of failure. Current stitching needles have serious limitations that make stitching slow, tedious, and inaccurate. The two-part needle technology proposed in this project fundamentally changes how stitching can be performed. Better quality and faster stitching provides a societal benefit of improved patient outcomes as well as commercial benefits of avoided costs associated with failed surgeries and savings from reduced procedure times.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports development of a revolutionary suturing device that will advance stitching capabilities for orthopedic ligament and tendon repair surgery. The groundbreaking two-part needle design offers a value proposition of improved speed and quality of stitching, two essential elements for clinical success. This project has two overarching technical objectives: First, prototypes will be constructed with variable characteristics, and force testing will be performed to determine how each characteristic impacts functionality of the device. Performance of the device with regards to forces experienced during stitching will be compared to conventional needles. Second, prototypes will be constructed and tested by potential customers to assess usability for the intended purpose of creating specific stitch patterns. Speed of stitching and biomechanical strength of the stitch patterns will be compared to patterns created with conventional needles to quantify the value proposition. Successful completion of the objectives will substantially advance the two-part needle technology toward commercialization in orthopedics and provide a basis for additional research of the two-part needle design for other surgical applications that rely on stitching.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to train physicians efficiently, assure high-quality patient care, and provide the United States with a robustly competent physician workforce. Current assessment practices require attending physicians and surgeons to review tens-to-hundreds of data points, removing them from clinical activities. Integrating a machine learning model in an existing resident assessment system to predict performance can address trainees’ learning needs and identify excelling, competent, and struggling residents months earlier. This is vital to patient care: earlier identification of trainee performance can benefit patient care faster than the current human-based, semiannual process. Improved tracking and documentation of competence may be of interest to multiple stakeholders including patients, hospitals, third-party payers such as insurance companies or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the residency accreditation entity, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Improved, automated assessment models using existing trainee data help training programs facing increasing documentation burden, as well as hospitals and third-party payers interested in reducing adverse health events for the patients they serve.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate an artificial intelligence model to support resident physician training programs in customizing training based on individual learners’ needs. Starting with plastic and reconstructive surgery and one of the four training programs in the United States engaged in time-variable training is an efficient way to create, test, and assess the model’s efficacy. The created machine learning model will be assessed for its predictive ability at different points during resident physicians’ training and compared with attending physicians’ assessments of trainees’ skills. Such models make time-variable training feasible enabling adaptive, needs-based scheduling of various educational rotations. This has the added advantages of keeping residents fully engaged in their training and returning faculty physicians to clinical care faster, improving job satisfaction and reducing risk of burnout. Ultimately, time-variable training and use of their associated machine learning models will reduce the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; accelerate the entry of new, fully competent physicians into the workforce; and retain valuable physician educators in the workforce.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance an improved system to sense and map  atmospheric conditions using nano-drones that are the size of small birds; these systems have benefited from recent innovations in miniature power electronics and flight control sensors.  The proposed project leverages the safety, cost and portability advantages of these small form factor aircraft in a system of coordinated drones flying in formation to measure wind, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations. Each flight of the swarm can cover hundreds of square miles, creating a high resolution 3D map of atmospheric properties. This enables the study of wind currents and gas movement for applications including detection of urban gas leaks, smog movement, and forest fire detection. Satellite measurements can be validated and improved through aerial measurements. This research will benefit public health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance new software to analyze and optimize nano-drones. This project will expand the understanding of miniaturized (under 100 g) drone performance and enable the development of advanced nano-drones to carry out valuable sensing missions. This project will: (1) validate an optimization framework with laboratory test data; (2) develop a novel, portable drone docking station allowing for easy launching, landing and charging of hundreds or thousands of drones by a single operator, eventually enabling fully automated use for continuous monitoring applications; and (3) develop visualization and analysis tools to facilitate data analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to support the domestic lumber industry, specifically for loblolly pine, through biological research. The proposed project brings forestry within the scope of the emerging science of genome editing with powerful impacts. Enhanced traits allow commercial entities in pulp and paper manufacturing to save energy and chemical costs; a pulp and paper facility can potentially reduce costs by up to 6%, exceptional for an industry that provides everyday items, such as hygienic tissue and cardboard for deliveries, at thin profit margins. Furthermore, trees play an important role in carbon sequestration, but they need to survive the temperature changes and potential infestations. With the advance of the proposed technology, editing forests could eventually gain acceptance as a significant avenue to bioresource sustainability and carbon sequestration.

    The proposed project combines the insights of tree genetics with the power of genome editing to generate enhanced genotypes with functional attributes that improve tree growth, processing and sustainability. Based on an integrated predictive model of genes responsible for phenotypes of commercial interest in relevant species, it is possible to select combinations of genome editing targets responsible for enhanced phenotypes, such as lignin content and syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, to modulate the composition of trees as to increase their propensity for processing, their environmental resilience, or valuable commercial features. Using CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, the project will multiplex target these genetic sequences concurrently to generate the intended genetic alteration combinations, using expertise in delivery to commercially relevant elite germplasm. Conventional breeding in forestry is slow and cumbersome because the long generation time of trees requires decades per breeding cycle. No alternative technology is currently feasible for accelerated genetic improvement of forest trees. With the proposed technology, annual crops can be efficiently bred on biannual or annual cycles with the same or improved properties as their conventionally-bred counterparts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project lie in the greater availability of healthy, local, and affordable produce for all levels of society through new methods of end-to-end labor automation and energy management in urban agriculture. Through a low-footprint vertical greenhouse design, this technology will enable individuals to grow produce on small areas of available space for their community. The produce will be an attractive alternative to large-scale industrial agriculture and foreign food imports, not only for sustainability concerns, but through its superior freshness, quality, and taste. This project will have an impact on the advancement of local farming technologies to further the viability of commercial food production in urban communities. Creating an economically viable urban farm will have lasting impacts on the U.S. food system and environment as it will provide a means for sustainable food production.

    The Phase I effort will be used to design, build, and demonstrate a subscale vertical farm prototype that demonstrates cost-effective methods for all aspects of the farm’s end-to-end labor automation. This will advance the implementation of robotics in food production by addressing the labor and energy barriers that local controlled environmental agriculture systems currently face. To achieve this objective, key challenges include (1) automation to completely remove human labor over extended durations, (2) low-cost design for setup and ongoing operations, and (3) the ability to adjust product outputs in real-time to market demands. Human interaction with the grow process will be limited through high degree of system automation, including computer vision for plant inspections and self-cleaning processes. Novel plant growth and handling processes will allow for virtually any type of produce. A variety of sensors are used to carefully monitor conditions and adjust the system, allowing fresh produce in areas without suitable agricultural opportunities. The prototype robotic farming system being developed in the Phase I effort will demonstrate the end-to-end labor automation and energy management technologies necessary to the expansion of urban agriculture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is in reducing carbon dioxide emissions while delivering a sustainable solution to meet the global demand for green fuels and chemicals. Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas linked to climate change and environmental concerns. Solutions to sequester carbon dioxide underground and in deep oceans are expensive, and the long-term effectiveness, safety, and associated environmental impacts are unclear. This project allows highly efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable green products using only renewable solar energy. The cost-effective, sustainable production of green fuels utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock will be key to reducing emissions and lowering dependency on fossil-based sources. Low-cost green fuels, such as methane, are expected to accelerate the penetration of a $30 billion market for the transportation and power generation sectors.

    This project addresses the fact that the high stability of carbon dioxide and conventional approaches to convert these molecules  involve high temperature, high pressure, and/or extremely reactive reagents, rendering them expensive and harmful to the environment. Artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach to convert carbon dioxide and water into commercially valuable chemical products, such as methane, methanol, formic acid and syngas, using only solar energy. This project will assess the technical feasibility of a revolutionary artificial photosynthesis system based on photocatalyst wafers prepared using magnetron sputter epitaxy (MSE) to generate green methane from carbon dioxide in a single step. The proposed project utilizes low-cost, scalable processes to prepare photocatalyst wafers with high efficiencies and stabilities that can be extrapolated to 20+ years of operation lifetime. The key challenge is to effectively combine the novel carbon dioxide reduction functionality with the unique light harvesting and water oxidation platform, and optimize the operating parameters to enhance the overall system efficiency and robustness. The goal is to demonstrate photocatalyst wafers with 10+% solar to fuel efficiencies, unprecedented long-term stability in the carbon dioxide reduction process, and a bench-scale prototype for performance validation.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is to use waste to produce clean, green energy. The proposed technology diverts waste material from landfills while sequestering carbon and can be used in many other industries such as food waste, forestry biomass and disaster relief.  For example, wildfires are becoming an annual threat that destroys large portions of states and thousands of homes. The proposed technology can reduce wildfire risk by cleaning up the forest undergrowth. Landfills in many states will be reaching maximum capacity in coming years and are under threat of being shut down: diverting landfill waste to the production of valuable products is much desired. Besides municipal waste, it is also possible to reduce the burning of agricultural waste by converting these waste streams into valuable outputs, such as biofuels and biochar for use in applications including concrete and water filtration. A significant amount of carbon is sequestered in this process which can earn additional carbon credits to the operator.

    The proposed project will develop a low-pressure hydrothermal liquefaction Inclined Rotary Gasifier (IRG). The project will optimize its outputs to further clean up the liquid & gas product streams from heavy metal contaminants such as Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn, and Cd, and high concentrations of other contaminants. Phase I research will focus on developing the process to remove up to 90% of the original concentration of these contaminants without compromising the syngas energy content. This will require maximizing the biochar production rate. These rates are typically lower than those when biomass is used as a feedstock. Hence a detailed investigation into the system's thermal efficiency will be undertaken with an aim to increase it. This may require increasing the heat transfer rates through design modifications and the choice of operating conditions. The bio-oil and water (from the high-pressure dewatering system) will also be cleaned by the biochar produced by the same municipal solid waste feedstock.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ adhesives in seasonally cool (< 50°F), wet weather.  Since successful commercialization\
    \ of an alternative PCB treatment technology requires approval from EPA in accordance\

    \ will be evaluated against the regulation’s stringent 1 ppm high occupancy cleanup\

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project will address the provision of safe water to our global population.  In high income nations, high-quality drinking water is provided through centralized water-treatment/distribution systems.  For 2-3 billion people in lower income countries, clean drinking water is not a guarantee.  They must collect and store household water, often in open containers without disinfectant.  The consequences of these deficiencies include the consumption of unsafe water that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality from water-related diseases.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that one possible solution to this problem is to decentralize water treatment so that people treat their water right before they consume it in their homes (e.g. point-of-use water treatment).  However, designing point-of-use water treatment technologies is a challenging problem that requires the product to be technologically effective, simple to use, inexpensive, and socially acceptable.  This project will develop a disruptive technology for point-of-use water treatment and will meet these rigorous design criteria.  The technology has the potential to improve water quality, human health, and quality of life for millions of people around the world while employing US citizens for manufacturing and sales of the product.

    This project seeks to develop and test methods to apply metallic copper and an N-halamine coating to the surface of a porous ceramic tablet for household water purification in lower income countries.  The resulting tablet will effectively disinfect viruses, bacteria, and protozoa in 10-20 liters of stored household water for one year (over 7000 liters total) with a cost of less than 0.3 cents per liter.  Copper salt solution will be reduced through high-temperature heating to form microscopic clusters of metallic copper.  When added to water, the copper will oxidize to release copper ions into solution to cause pathogen disinfection. This component will be combined with an existing technology that releases silver ions from a porous ceramic tablet.  The synergistic effects of these disinfectants may enable 1-3-star certification from the World Health Organization.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is two-folds: (1) increasing the accessibility of construction lightweight aggregate (LWA) for the concrete industry and (2) conversion of waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA) to value-added products (i.e., construction LWA). Yearly, about 100 million tons of coal combustion ash is produced in the US, of which only about 60% is recycled and the rest is moved to the landfills. This imposes risks to human health and the environment. Meanwhile, accessibility of construction LWA that is traditionally produced from clay, slate, and shale is challenging for the concrete industry in some states due to the absence of local construction LWA manufacturers. Therefore, LWA must be imported from elsewhere in the country, increasing (i) the final cost for the material and (ii) greenhouse gas emission due to transportation. With an abundance of W-CCA landfills scattered throughout the US, LWA can be produced from this material near the landfill sites to increase the local accessibility of construction LWA for the concrete industry. By implementing this technology, the environmental impact of W-CCA will be reduced, natural resource consumption will be prevented, CO2 emission associated with material transportation will be reduced, and users can save money by having access to local construction LWA.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses hurdles associated with manufacturing a novel porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) produced from waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA). The melting properties of W-CCA enable the production of construction LWA with superior engineering properties, including increased water absorption/desorption capacity and concrete workability relative to traditional LWA.  The deliverables of this project include: (i) development of a LWA with desired sintering properties during pilot-scale production to assure technical feasibility of scaling-up the proposed technology, (ii) optimization of pilot-scale rotary kiln parameters translatable to large-scale production, (iii) demonstration of the superior engineering properties of LWA for concrete applications produced at lab pilot-scale, and (iv) demonstration of the non-leachability of W-CCA based LWA in encapsulated concrete applications.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is in development of fully-biodegradable disposable personal care products, particularly menstrual pads. In general, menstrual pads cannot be recycled or be composted by municipal facilities after use because of issues with the biodegradable hot-melt adhesives to construct and position them. Biodegradation may be the best way to reduce the environmental impact associated with them, particularly in geographies where municipal solid waste facilities are underdeveloped.  Ultimately, non-toxic, safe and effective disposable menstrual pads could improve quality of life for menstruating women and the environment, and provide a new commercial opportunity for producers in the US and around the globe.

    The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of synthesizing a combination of biodegradable thermoplastics and biological additives that will create a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). This PSA must performs well in commercial hot glue application machinery as well as in the intended products, completely and safely degrade within six months of use, and is commercially viable at scale. These parameters have yet to be met by biological-based adhesives. The research approach is as follows: First, develop and synthesize PSAs using a biological base polymer and biological-based biodegradable additives, including plasticizers, tackifiers, and compatibilizers to enhance the performance of the PSAs. Second, characterize PSAs based on established use and manufacturing requirements and optimize the composition to ensure the requirements are met. Third, test PSA compositions for degradation, including length of time required for complete biodegradation under landfill, soil, and water conditions, including marine environments.  Identify intermediate chemical molecules and structures that form as a result of the biodegradation process, determine their potential hazards on both the environment and the health of biological organisms.  This project will develop a biodegradable PSA that will meet manufacturing and performance standards in menstrual pads and show that the PSA can be fully biodegradable in less than six months under non-specialized environmental conditions, without the need of mechanochemical or photo degradation processes.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will be to recycle certain plastics into soil amendments to improve both environmental degradation and agricultural health.  Plastic waste is a persistent environmental pollutant partly due to the lack of comprehensive technologies to reduce the in-circulation inventory of these petrochemical products, and comparably low value of plastic-derived and recycled products. The carbon contained within mixed plastic waste represents both a significant pollutant, but also a potentially valuable alternative feedstock for domestic agriculture and regenerating degraded soils. Soil carbon is a key driver in building soil health, agricultural productivity and food security, as well as a significant reservoir for long-term carbon sequestration. This project remediates traditionally non-recyclable, low-value mixed plastic waste and transforms it into a high value compost-like material. The proposed research develops a low-cost, distributed, decentralized process suitable for small, remote, rural, marginalized and underrepresented communities to achieve sustainable, domestic solid waste management as well as build and regenerate soil health for self-sufficient local agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase I project will scale and optimize a plastic oxidation process that employs a novel high efficiency intramolecular modification of Fenton oxidation. The aqueous process utilizes a low-cost, green catalyst that does not require high temperatures or organic solvents to cleave and oxidize a wide range of commercial polymers into bioavailable long-chain fatty acids suitable as a soil microbe substrate and soil organic carbon amendment. Compared to the highly variable process of natural biodegradation, this reaction ensures complete remediation before environmental application through controlled chemical oxidation. This research will aim to characterize this novel process towards a scalable technoeconomic model to guide translation at scale. Methods include near-infrared spectroscopy to track the elimination of microplastics and other toxic components common to plastic waste processing. The plastic-derived, environmentally beneficial soil amendments will be further studied in greenhouse and field trials to evaluate key agronomic indicators, such as amendment-microbe interactions, soil health, productivity and others.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing safe, cost-effective elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater in order to protect human health and the environment while reducing the cost and complexity of remediation. PFAS are some of the world’s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS pose a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. PFAS in groundwater cannot be broken down through traditional chemical processes; Hence, current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream where the efficacy and safety of disposal are still uncertain.  This project focuses on the development of a low cost, sustainable treatment method that eliminates PFAS with no secondary waste generation and no costly consumables.  This technology removes the liability and environmental and health risks associated with incomplete elimination and secondary waste disposal.

    The objective of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to develop a safe, chemical-free and low cost PFAS electrolyzer for groundwater remediation. The electrolyzer consists of a divided radial-field unit cell architecture with a de-polarized cathode and a high surface area and low-cost anode electrocatalyst material. The electrocatalyst is designed to provide direct oxidation at high voltage and the treatment process will mineralize PFAS in a single step, in minutes, with no breakdown byproducts or secondary waste. A scalable, single unit cell bench-top electrolyzer will be designed and built for treatability testing of PFAS-contaminated groundwater.  The anode electrocatalyst material composition will be optimized and coated onto high surface area substrates.  A de-polarized cathode will be developed to eliminate the catholyte loop and hydrogen generation, and lower energy consumption. The PFAS mineralization effectiveness will be measured as a function of operating parameters and water quality.  The electrocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism of the new anode material will be determined. Using the experimental results, the capital and operating cost of a groundwater remediation system will be estimated.

    \ Phase I project is the increased ability to gain knowledge about microplastic\
    \ concentrations in bodies of water rapidly, easily, and relatively cheaply through\
    \ the first real-time sensor. Microplastics are a worldwide pollution problem\
    \ that have devastating impacts on ecosystem services, human health, and fishery\
    \ economics. Interest in microplastics is surging, with many academics, nonprofits,\
    \ and government agencies all beginning microplastic research and monitoring programs.\
    \ However, the limiting factor in studying and monitoring microplastics is that\
    \ all current methods for collecting and analyzing them are extremely time-consuming.\
    \ There are many current knowledge gaps about microplastic abundance due to bottlenecks\
    \ in analyzing samples. This technology, in creating the first real-time flow-through\
    \ sensor to analyze microplastic concentration, would begin to close those gaps.\
    \ The benefits to the customer of this sensor include reduced labor costs, and\
    \ reproducible and accurate data. These benefits may inform remediation strategies\
    \ and policy decisions that could lead to a subsequent reduction of microplastics\
    \ globally. Reducing microplastics in the environment can have ecological and\
    \ human health benefits for the American people. \n\nThis project aims to build\
    \ the first flow-through, real-time sensor for microplastics. The technology could\
    \ reduce the sampling time of microplastic abundances by measuring ultrasonic\
    \ frequencies. Using very large bandwidth ultrasound energy, the sensor will record\
    \ different resonant and scattering responses of the suspended plastic particles\
    \ based on size, shape, and material properties which will vary by plastic composition\
    \ and weathering state.  All of these factors will inform scientists about the\
    \ concentration and composition of the sample. This technology is differentiated\
    \ from current measurement methods of microplastic concentration by its novel\
    \ combination of ultrasound technologies that have already been proven in both\
    \ the medical and non-destructive inspection communities for in-liquid microparticle\
    \ classification. This project will allow microplastics measurements to be taken\
    \ quickly and easily for the first time, allowing for a rapid expansion of microplastics\
    \ measurements, not only in America’s oceans, lakes, and streams, but also in\
    \ wastewater and drinking water treatment plants, desalination plants, agriculture\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the development of an economically viable process that can help mitigate and reverse climate change by pulling carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and using it to make durable polymers used in items that surround us every day. There is increasing global pressure to end emissions-intensive, fossil fuel-based operations. However, society has a extensive infrastructure that uses hydrocarbon as fuels as well as in plastics and other polymers. The proposed system will be used to manufacture useful hydrocarbon materials using carbon dioxide captured from air and hydrogen split from water. This technology represents a new pathway for meeting global demand for hydrocarbons without relying on fossil fuels, which may result not only in reduced emissions but in a net draw-down of the “legacy CO2” in the atmosphere. This technology may create new jobs in the American economy, mostly outside the urban commercial centers.

    This SBIR project will develop a novel system that integrates CO2 direct air capture into a water electrolysis device so as to produce a stream of captured CO2 and green hydrogen (H2) from a single device with energy requirements not much higher than water electrolysis alone. The system relies on two primary innovations: 1) a water electrolysis process using a unique buffer solution and a novel reactor design that combines direct air contact with water electrolysis to simultaneously capture CO2 and produce H2 from water, and 2) a new hollow fiber membrane bioreactor that uses multiple layers of hydrogel-encapsulated organisms to convert the electrolysis reactor’s emissions into biogenic methane (also known as renewable natural gas or RNG), and eventually into more complex hydrocarbon molecules. The goal of this project is to optimize the performance of both the electrolysis reactor and the bioreactor in order to demonstrate an economically viable pathway for capturing ambient CO2 and “upcycling” it into RNG. While the initial upcycling target is RNG, the emissions from the electrolysis reactor are suitable for conversion into more complex hydrocarbons.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to broaden access to healthcare data. Users of the system developed in this project can take biometric measurements such as heart rate, muscle-activity, and body mass calculations in real-time, with data collected through sensors embedded into clothing.  The innovation enables vital measurements to be taken, both inside and outside of clinical environments, while reducing instrumentation weight and cost requirements. This fabric-based technology can potentially serve users ranging from medical professionals to everyday consumers who will more easily adopt wearable soft-material products in lieu of traditional hardware devices. Specialized sectors such as physical therapy, pre-surgical studies, sports labs, and out-patient care have the highest growth opportunity for new technology adoption. Complementing the rapid growth of telehealth, bio-sensing capabilities for real-time and remote tracking will improve patient compliance and aid health care workers by providing better access to comprehensive vital measurement data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves material science research in conductive threads and fabrics. These soft goods can bend, stretch, and compress along the body where they are worn. In addition, their electromechanical characteristics allow them to pick up small voltage and current signals that are naturally generated from the body, specifically from the heart, muscles, and the brain. By strategically weaving these materials within a shirt, small voltages for EKG (heart), EMG (muscle), EEG (brain), and BIA (water and body mass content) can be simultaneously captured and measured for heart rate, muscle activity, brain activity, and water and fat content measurements. The technical research will involve innovation in fabric-materials optimized for small signal and low noise pickup and design of a comfortable garment incorporating multiple fabric-based electrodes for simultaneous pickup of EKG/EMG/BIA signals. The project will also develop new signal processing algorithms to transform raw voltages to real-time signals transmitted wirelessly. The desired technical result is a functional and wearable prototype with end-to-end communication from the fabric through the garment to a receiving mobile or desktop app visualizing the processed data for heart rate, muscle activity, and body mass analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve data harnessing and real-time intelligent decision making. The proposed technology is a new reconfigurable computing platform capable of performing a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks in a distributed and parallel manner to deliver the best performance at a lower cost. The end products are AI accelerator chips that can be integrated in Accelerator Cards or as co-processors to be applied in both server and edge computing solutions to accelerate AI tasks. The general market need is particularly acute for data center and cloud computing industries where major pain points are performance bottlenecks and high costs due to custom chips or reliance on graphic processing units. The core value propositions of the proposed technology are faster compute, programmability at run-time, and easier integration with existing software to enable execution of popular machine learning frameworks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase I project centers around a novel computing approach where computing and memory elements are parallel and distributed, and interconnection between computing elements is flexible. The project develops an integrated circuit chip that can be reconfigured at run-time to behave as a custom application-specific integrated circuit for each running Artificial Intelligence (AI) application to deliver the optimal performance. It will overcome the memory bottleneck that traditional computing technologies face where data needs to be continuously loaded to and from memory.  The proposed technology also addresses the adaptivity challenge for evolving AI models and datasets. The proposed activities include a chip fabrication using a 28nm commercial semiconductor foundry process, extensive benchmarking of the new technology for scalability, adaptability to data size and shape, and research on a software interface to execute codes developed by existing machine learning frameworks in the new chip. The prototype chip is expected to demonstrate distributed and parallel computing capabilities along with dynamic reconfigurability.  The benchmarking work is anticipated to reveal at least an order of magnitude improvement over more conventional graphics processing unit based approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate feasibility of machine-learning (ML)-guided experimental campaigns that predict, assess, and optimize electroorganic transformations with small experimental datasets. Companies across the chemical industry have pinpointed electrochemistry as a promising avenue for the implementation of more sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. However, the large cost and effort required in new process development hinders the implementation of electrochemical technologies. ML predictive algorithms can be a powerful tool to accelerate the development and optimization of more sustainable chemical processes, but repeatedly require large amounts of experimental data to train the models. These large datasets are often unavailable and expensive to obtain, which significantly limits the use of ML in the chemical industry. The project will advance future manufacturing by enabling the development of new and more sustainable chemical production routes using 50% less experiments, ultimately unlocking the manufacture of new molecules, medicines, and materials in societal applications. Moreover, by reducing the number of experiments required, the technology will significantly lower emissions and resource consumption in the industry.

    The proposed project introduces a ML platform capable of guiding experimental campaigns and data collection to enable accurate predictions of reaction behavior with the smallest possible datasets. The approach relies on the combination of chemical engineering and ML knowledge to overcome the optimization limitations found within each field. It will be validated using the electrooxidation of p-methoxytoluene as a model reaction and will elucidate the fundamental limitations and strengths of ML predictive models capturing the complexity of physical systems with small datasets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the reduction of silicon in PV modules from 4¢/W to 0.8-1¢/W. Besides considerable silicon price reduction, this novel technology removes currently presented safety and environmental concerns of silicon production. Decreasing the total PV module cost will improve access to solar cells, through which the overall consumption of fossil fuels could be reduced. Moreover, since this novel technology is zero direct GHG emission, replacing the current manufacturing processes with our new technology can positively affect the environment directly and immediately. This project will also advance the state-of-the-art in silicon manufacturing and provide a domestic source of PV quality silicon.

    This project aims to develop a new molten salt electrolysis process which can produce solar silicon from natural 99.7-99.9% pure quartzite (SiO₂) in just two steps, replacing a complex energy-intensive five-step process today.  This process utilizes a state-of-the-art molten salt composition with a new mechanism for suppressing dendrite formation and salt trapping. This process can potentially produce silicon with 4-5N purity at $1.70/kg using <30 kWh/kg, with pure oxygen by-product and zero direct Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The 4-5N product purity would be sufficient for directional solidification or direct boule/wafer production, resulting in $2.20-2.70/kg solar-grade silicon cost, i.e., 75-80% lower than today. This purity through the novel process is achievable via electrochemical selection, an inert anode to avoid carbon anode contamination, and low impurity solubility in the solid silicon product. The technical issues/risks to be addressed in this proposal are salt trapping to practically produce dense and pure product, removing more electronegative impurities (P, Fe) that cause problems with carrier lifetimes, and utilizing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) stirring to overcome stagnant electrolyte bath.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an improved bolt tightening technology applicable to a wide variety of industries including renewable, power generation, transportation, and infrastructure. The basic bolt-tightening method utilizing a torque-wrench has remained largely unchanged since the introduction of the modern fastener in the 1800s. This results in a preload variation of up to 30% in a multi-bolt joint. New methods, including preload sensing, reduce this variation down to 15% albeit at a high cost. High preload variation leads to inefficient joints, bolt loosening, bolt rupture, and leakage problems over the joint’s lifetime. The proposed innovation can potentially reduce this variation down to 5%, a significant improvement. Additionally, it allows multi-bolt joint tightening in just two passes compared to the current method of four passes which saves time and labor. Successful implementation of the proposed technology will be beneficial in reducing the cost of energy, in particular, offshore wind which is poised for rapid growth in the US. Additionally, it will help prevent hazardous leakage of joints in the nuclear, petrochemical, and oil and gas industries and prevent vibration loosening of joints in the transportation, infrastructure, and heavy machinery industries.

    The proposed technology combines existing, widely used technologies, such as a torque-wrench and ultrasonic bolt tension measurement, with a unique and proprietary computer algorithm. The proposed innovation offers precise control of bolt tensioning, which is essential for the reliability of multi-bolt flange joints. The fundamental concept is already proven through high-fidelity simulations. In Phase I research, simulation studies will continue on more realistic multi-bolt joints to further validate the algorithm. The primary goal of Phase I research is the experimental validation and optimization of the proposed algorithm. Extensive testing will be conducted on a scaled-down flange joint with the help of ultrasonic preload sensors. The secondary goal is the development of a minimum viable product concept based on this system.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical care for patients requiring blood vessel grafts that are autologous, or come from the same patient.  In the United States,1.4 million patients need arterial replacements each year. Bypass graft surgeries and reconstructive surgeries often involve the replacement of diseased or damaged blood vessels with a graft of an artery or vein taken from another part of the body. These procedures are invasive and dangerous. In addition, using autologous grafts to reconstruct branched vessels in certain indications (e.g., in hand reconstruction surgeries or free-flap procedures) prolongs the surgery and may increase the risk of post-operative complications. The proposed technology allows for creation of engineered systems that can be used as grafts. More over, they can be used for pre-clinical testing of cardiovascular devices, limiting the need (and costs) associated with animal studies, as well as potentially other systems, such as the lung and trachea.

    This project advances a process to manufacture a system that follows the complex geometries and characteristics of native blood vessels. Current practice to create artificial blood vessel grafts is limited to simple shapes or systems with non-optimal mechanical/structural properties.  This project develops a new method for creation of nanofibrous vessels with complex geometries via 3D printing, creation of sacrificial collectors, and electrospinning. The first objective will be to develop nanofibrous vessel scaffolds with different geometries (cylindrical, bifurcated, and trifurcated) and diameters using sacrificial collectors and evaluate microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the vessels. The second objective will be to evaluate biocompatibility of the nanofibrous vessels by testing the viability, adhesion, and proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to secure Integrated Circuit (IC) Intellectual Property (IP) against untrusted parties in the globalized IC supply chain.  Outsourcing of IC foundries creates risks of IC reverse engineering, overproduction, theft, and even piracy. A promising method of achieving hardware IP security is by logically locking the functionality of a design by replacing a subset of the design components with programmable elements. The correct content of these elements forms the key for unlocking/activation of the design in a secure facility and/or via a secure protocol after manufacturing. A technical challenge in commercializing this technology is the long time period typically needed to assess the security of a locked design against state-of-the-art attack algorithms at the design phase. This project will address this technical challenge by developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted design security analyzer tool to instantaneously provide an accurate attack runtime estimation on a locked design, significantly reducing the design time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly shorten the time required to assess attack resiliency of an obfuscated (locked) Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Running the state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability solvers (SAT attack) on a state-of-the-art computer server to de-obfuscate a locked design can take time - ranging from days to months. Such a long security analysis time is prohibitive for deployment in the design process where iterative design optimizations are needed for making power, performance, area, and security (PPAS) trade-offs. This project aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel approach that will bring the security assessment time down to near zero using a machine-learning based model. Based on recent advancements in graph and geometric deep learning techniques, an innovative end-to-end security assessment framework is proposed that directly and losslessly ingests the original design as a graph-structured input, and then automatically learns the discriminative features that influence logic locking security. To support sufficient data for the proposed data-driven method, a logic locking macro-database will be developed that encompasses the required PPAS, attack and defense information.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide cruelty-free, safe and sustainable solutions to replace animal-sourced exotic leathers by leveraging new advances in biotechnology and additive manufacturing. The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of employing natural as well as synthetic components for the fabrication of exotic skins as a precursor raw material for further processing into consumer goods. Specifically, formulations composed of chemical building blocks of native animal skin will be designed, formulated, produced, and subsequently fabricated into composite leather mimics using advanced additive manufacturing platforms. If successful, the proposed efforts will lead to prototypes of engineered composite materials that reproduce the aesthetic, physical, mechanical, and performance properties of exotic leathers. Providing animal-free, sustainable, and environmentally friendly options to conventional exotic leathers can have a significant societal and environmental impact, while opening a new market and supporting growth in the leather processing and tanning industry.

    This project will replace conventional exotic leathers with alternatives that mimic the native structure and biochemical composition of exotic skins; recapitulate the mechanical and physical properties of the exotic leathers; and able to be manufactured using environmentally friendly, sustainable and xenofree technologies. Two critical technical challenges addressed as part of the proposed research will include engineering the architecture of exotic leathers in a bottoms-up approach by combining the relevant building blocks of exotic skins; and employing advanced manufacturing platforms to develop processes that are xenofree, sustainable and environmentally friendly. The research goal is to replicate the constituent collagen-based building blocks of the dermal matrix. Collagen fibrils of the dermal matrix are formed primarily by the triple-helix-forming polypeptide subdomains that can independently recreate the fibrillar self-assembled geometries seen with full-length collagen protein. The proposed work will use collagen and collagen-mimicking subdomains, along with other matrix molecules, to mimic the molecular and supramolecular self-assembly of fibrils in the dermal matrix to precisely control the diameter, density, and orientations of the constituent structures of leather.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to build a condition assessment and monitoring platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for intelligent decision support to expedite diagnosis and facilitate personalized therapy solutions. Currently, patient history data is obtained verbally, and poor health communication between clinician and patient potentially causes 78% of misdiagnoses, resulting in 80,000 avoidable hospital deaths and $750 billion in costs to the US economy each year. Language barriers exacerbate this situation significantly, increasing the risk of severe and frequent adverse outcomes by 49%. Patients with cultural, language, and low health literacy are twice as affected. The proposed work has three major technical objectives: (1) develop an interactive visually-supported healthcare data capture user interface (UI) to overcome communication and language barriers, (2) develop an AI-based risk assessment engine to communicate symptoms to the provider for triage decisions, and (3) leverage predictive analytics to recommend appropriate treatment options and develop a visualization-based condition monitoring and management tool.  The proposed data collection and AI-powered provider decision support platform will empower patients and providers by enhancing communication, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is designed for accessibility across all levels of literacy and is language-agnostic. The platform’s digitally-native, cloud-based approach allows it to be scalable for widespread impact and faster impact. The frontend app captures important patient information and symptoms before the patient exam and summarizes the patient self-report in an easily readable format for the clinician. The clinician will potentially be more prepared, facilitating the delivery of personalized care and improved outcomes by avoiding misdiagnosis, errors, and complications earlier in a patient’s journey. The AI-based model pulls structured data, such as demographic information and symptoms from the patient self-report, and the dataset undergoes supervised learning using historical, real-world outcomes data. Multiple AI models will be evaluated, including classification and neural network models, and those with sufficiently accurate performance will be considered as inputs for ensemble learning, the final prediction output for this project. Example outputs include patient evaluators such as consistencies within the patient’s self-report, an estimated risk assessment score, and an approximate diagnosis accuracy score.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a data analytic tool to predict and identify the organ of origin from early cancer screening blood tests. This will allow noninvasive detection of cancer at early stages, when it can be treated with potentially improved outcomes and in a less costly manner.  Second, a complementary application of the proposed  technology is to address an unmet need in identifying cancer organ of origin in metastatic cancers of unknown primary, where not knowing the organ of origin hampers designing an effective treatment plan in 30,000+ cases/yr in the U.S.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accomplish internal development, and external validation of the proposed data analytic technology so it is ready to be validated on circulating tumor DNA data from blood, and can be used for metastatic tumors of unknown primary origin.  The proposed technology addresses the problem of the unknown primary by analyzing whole genome or large subsets using predictive tools. Different cancer (sub)types have different patterns or signatures of somatic single nucleotide variations in the cancer genome. A library of these signatures is built using a large number of whole genome data samples with a broad cross-section of known cancer (sub)types. The unknown cancer organ of origin of a new data sample is identified by comparing its somatic mutational patterns to the signatures in the library. A key research objective is to identify the minimum subset of whole genome required to determine the cancer organ of origin to facilitate its application in blood tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce opioid dependence.  A critical challenge in the use of opioids on a long-term basis is balancing benefit and risk, based on determining the optimal dosage to manage the associated risks against side effects.  Opioid tapers are used to manage this risk and may last from several weeks to several years. However, following the voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, many patients report improvements in function, sleep, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or even with decreased pain levels. Furthermore, tapers are typically used to manage opioid tolerance, hyperalgesia, enable more effective pain management prior to surgical procedures, or transition to another form of opioids or non-opioid pain medication.  Nearly 18 million Americans may benefit from an opioid taper to improve the long-term management of their chronic pain and improve the safety and effectiveness of chronic opioid therapy.  In particular, in rural communities, patients may not have access to pain specialists and rely on their primary care physicians for chronic pain management. The proposed technology provides a critical tool for opioid tapering to rural primary care physicians, where almost half of the opioids are prescribed. Using the clinical decision support tool, primary care physicians will have a virtual pain specialist advising of the anticipated predictive outcomes and actions to ensure a successful taper with direct feedback from the patient.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply machine learning techniques to develop algorithms using a dataset that describes successful and unsuccessful tapers with clinical data, medical decision making, patient experience, and physician /patient interaction and communication. The predictive model will inform the medical decision-maker of the likelihood of successive patient events and their impact on the taper outcome based on real-time data about the patient's physical, psychological, social, and emotional experience.  This innovation will be implemented on a smartphone platform to extend the physician / patient medical decision model beyond the clinical setting into the patient's environment. This will create a new model of a patient-centric taper wherein the estimated clinical outcomes and associated actions are informed by optimizing the patient experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance exploration and commercial development of the Moon and, eventually, solar system, by lowering the risk of damage to surface and orbital infrastructure from ejected lunar dust during rocket landings and launches. This activity is in the area of material processing/manufacturing in space, and focuses on the space infrastructure (civil works) market sector, similar to roads and airports on Earth. Creating a viable, cost-effective solution to mitigate lunar dust will lower the cost of accessing the lunar surface and accelerate the development of lunar surface infrastructure that is necessary for all aspects of sustainable commercial space development, including mining, manufacturing, construction, habitation, power generation, communications, and in particular, transportation. Facilitating lunar exploration will expand scientific knowledge of the solar system.  It will also enhance commercial development that will expand economic opportunities by opening new areas of the economy in space, with inevitable spin-off benefits for life on Earth. In the long term, the capacity to create new areas for habitation on the Moon and throughout the solar system will have profound impacts on human society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes building lunar landing pads to address the problem of surface dust ejected during rocket landings and launches, which can otherwise damage both nearby and distant infrastructure, including those structures located the other side of the Moon and in orbit. To minimize transport costs from Earth, surface infrastructure must be constructed from local materials as much as possible. Instead of using high-energy processes to harden regolith, this approach will bind it with a high-performance polymer created from lunar volatiles co-located with water-ice in polar regions. This solution reduces mass, cost, and technical risk by leveraging anticipated water-ice mining operations and utilizing discarded volatiles from their operations to produce high-quality polymers.  The approach may be sustainable, producing enough material annually to replace worn-out sections of landing pads. Phase I will focus on converting raw volatiles into polymer precursors, fabricating/testing candidate composite materials, and elaborating the concept of operations, through a combination of research, modeling, and laboratory experiments. Information gathered during Phase I will narrow the range of candidate polymers for further consideration, identifying chemical synthesis pathways for more extensive development, and highlighting areas of improvement to maximize commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project stems from developing a wireless communications technology based on physical (PHY) layer rateless codes.  If successfully demonstrated, these codes could provide high data rates with low computational costs, minimum latency, and enhanced energy efficiency, i.e., long battery life. The initial target of the technological innovation is the space communications market - both commercial and government space programs. Space communication systems are a critical and integral part of every space mission. This Phase I project focuses on an enabling technology addressing capability gaps that could provide cheaper and faster solutions for the data communication systems. Commercialization of the proposed technology is beneficial to the US economy and government since the development of innovative technologies for the space sector contributes to economic growth in the emerging space economy. The proposed next-generation wireless communications technology may also support a wide variety of applications and use cases in the terrestrial wireless market. These application areas include 5G Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a PHY rateless codes-based novel adaptive transmission technology for the reliable transmission of information bits between a wireless transmitter and receiver. PHY rateless codes have the innate ability to adapt both the code construction and the number of code bits for an as-needed transmission of code bits. The adaptive transmission technology in the PHY layer interacts with the automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols in the data link layer (DLL) affecting its sequence of operations. The DLL designed for the traditional fixed-rate coding is a poor match for the PHY rateless system. A key goal of the proposed Phase I project is to design a simple and yet effective DLL for a proximity space link using PHY rateless codes which optimizes the throughput, establishing the technical feasibility. The Phase I project aims to add new design features to the PHY rateless encoder and decoder based on deep learning/auto encoder enhancements, structured permutations, and efficient algorithms/techniques for solving sparse linear systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on the development of a more secure computer infrastructure in the US, particularly for building automation systems, power systems, etc. Much of the current infrastructure runs on older computer architectures and the hardware suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed by upgrading the software.  This project seeks to allow ventors to find and fix hardware vulnerabilities more quickly and without constraints from intellectual property holders.  The project will allow un-modified Linux binaries to run as unikernels on the reduced instruction set of reduced instruction set computer-V (RISC-V) architecture. The RISC-V architecture is an open ISA (instruction set architecture) and allows for rapid innovation and broad adoption in the expanding edge and IoT (internet of things) space. Being able to deploy applications to RISC-V as unikernels versus ordinary Linux guests brings strong security, performance, and deployment benefits to the ecosystem.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project directly addresses performance, security, and deployment problems current edge and IoT projects. Current edge-based systems use operating systems that are multi-decades old, are hard to upgrade, and are targeted in cyberattacks worldwide. To enable advanced technology that requires edge compute such as machine learning applications to be safely deployed, the security concerns of the underlying operating system must be addressed. Unikernels are single process systems that can run programs on the same virtual machines with a heavily reduced attack surface. By applying unikernel technology to the RISC-V architecture, advanced technology can be more quickly deployed in a safer manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance the development of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) Flat Panel Antenna (FPA) which is a catalyst for ubiquitous, satellite-based communication. This project focuses on the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Ka-band frequencies (Tx 27.5-31GHz, Rx 17.7-21.2GHz) with FPA capable of connecting to all three constellations: Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) simultaneously. The development of these FPA will enable a new era of satellite communication, making the internet network a global network regardless of the user’s location on earth, with speeds comparable to, and in some cases higher than, land-based networks. FPA technology may spur further research into higher millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and the bandwidth benefits they offer. FPA technology may also be an enabler of the future hybrid wireless network used in connected cars and machines with direct Line of Sight (LOS) to a satellite.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel method of radiating aperture design for high bandwidth, high efficiency, low-cost, and lightweight next-generation satellite terminal Flat Panel Antenna (FPA). Recent activities in the satellite industry such as the new LEO constellations and High-Throughput Satellite (HTS) networks in GEO orbit have prompted the development of the FPA to be used in the user’s terminal. To support such a multi-orbit constellation, certain performance criteria such as Bandwidth, polarization diversity, cross-polarization rejection, and Antenna Gain need to be met with sufficient margin to guarantee reliable communication links. The existing Flat Panel Antenna technologies are either narrowband or bulky, which makes them not suitable for emerging satellite technology or multi-orbit communication. As a result, there is a need for a new Flat Panel Antenna that can cover the entire Ka-band frequencies (both Tx and Rx) to unlock the full potential of satellite communication in the Ka-band. The core of this project is developing the novel technology with all the attributes needed for multi-orbit communication.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the uptime of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and similar robotic systems to nearly one hundred percent at factories and fulfillment centers to further improve productivity and reduce overhead costs. These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in the marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in helping in the design of a cost-effective resiliency strategy for defense against the impacts of climate change. Today, the U.S. experiences significantly more weather events imposing substantially more financial burden compared to 40 years ago. As climate change accelerates, communities will be forced to endure increased financial burdens protecting against and mitigating its impacts. Research carried out in this SBIR project is intended to help reduce these expenses. Utilities, cities, insurance companies, and municipalities are stakeholders in these resiliency efforts and will be looking for new tools to help mitigate the effects and reduce the costs of climate change. The research in this project will enable utilities to reduce resilience-related costs and reduce impact on businesses and local economies due to power outages.  Such actions may benefit all communities, particularly poorer and marginal communities that often endure the worst impacts of climate change.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop predictive analytics for tropical storms and wildfires and to integrate this functionality into a power grid analytics software platform.  Three artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) tools will be implemented, qualitatively expanding on early prototypes: (1) in the satellite imagery (SI) domain, an optimized combination of deep-learning neural network (DLNN) techniques will be trained on large-scale satellite images, resulting in the world's first tree growth tracking and species identification tool; (2) a "Virtual Wind Tunnel" (VWT) will be augmented with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and empirical physics modeling to estimate the probability of trees damaging power transmission assets during weather events forecast; and (3) towards a no-code user interface, existing natural language processing (NLP) will be expanded, with the goal of processing queries from engineers unfamiliar with AI/ML. Key questions addressed by the research include whether the software platform will be able to adapt to new utility customers and service areas without sacrificing performance, whether increased data resolution can be effectively leveraged to better predictive power, and whether the platform can continuously improve event prediction over time by learning from historical grid data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the potential elimination of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). GVHD is a devastating illness that afflicts transplant recipients who are recovering from chemotherapy and who suffer from suppression of their bone marrow function and immune system. GVHD associated illnesses lead to a very high rate of premature death in these patients. This project focuses on the development of a novel biocomputational platform to generate patient-derived stem cells to be subsequently reintroduced to the same cancer patient. This completely bypasses third-party bone marrow and blood donations, decreasing, and potentially eliminating, lethal GVHD and drastically improving outcomes. The use of cells derived directly from the same patient (e.g. skin cells) to reconstitute the blood system is considered one of the highest and most challenging goals of blood system regenerative biology research. This will advance bioinformatics and cell therapy research and will advance the state-of-the-art in cancer treatment and personalized medicine.

    The proposed project will use a high-fidelity prototype computational tool to generate transcription factor recipes for cellular transdifferentiation, test those predicted recipes through systematic and high-throughput wetlab validations, and demonstrate proof of concept for the autologous production of persistent HSCs that maintain long-term multilineage engraftment and self-renewal, potentially enabling recapitulation of the entire blood lineage. The project scope includes an effort to survey, identify, and procure appropriate initial cell types; determine cell type-specific predictions for reprogramming into HSCs; prioritize the most promising recipes and carry out appropriate viral transductions; create an in vitro analog of target HSCs and determine alignment with the human HSC phenotype; and perform reprogramming experiments for the top transcription factor recipes. Data analysis will include key comparisons of reprogrammed HSCs, in vitro analog HSCs, primary human HSCs, and data from prior published efforts to produce HSCs. HSCs are fundamentally different from the differentiated cell types previously targeted with the computational tool, as they retain proliferative potential and are therefore very difficult to generate. Proof of concept in this challenging system will not only address GVHD, but also further prove the efficacy of the overall biocomputational platform for use in numerous other biological systems and potential cures.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improved food security, environmental benefits, and human health benefits.  This project will develop a meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meat.  The technology developed from the proposed project will be used to build a vertically integrated food manufacturing platform that can withstand supply chain disruptions from natural disasters and pandemics. These meat alternatives will reduce and replace traditional meat consumption, with many environmental benefits - lowered greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic pollution; lower use of energy, water and land; and reduced antibiotics usage. There are benefits to human health for reduced meat consumption. Furthermore, production costs will be eventually be comparable to that of mushroom farming.

    The proposed project aims to develop a fermentation-based meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meal through recombinant protein technologies.  Additionally, the project aims to leverage the texture and flavor of mushroom mycelia, and supplement this with recombinant muscle proteins to further enhance the taste and nutritional profiles and overcome many of the shortcomings of existing plant-based meat products. To date the concept of combining recombinant muscle protein and single cell protein is novel and has not been reported. Large gaps persist between plant-based and lab-grown meat, with regards to cost and consumer experience. Plant-based meat is more affordable but faces consumer resistance due to sub-optimal texture and nutritional profiles, while cultivated meat offers a consumer experience similar to that of animal meat but at a much higher cost. Towards this goal, muscle protein genes will be expressed in a microbial host and enzymatically cross-linked with vegetable protein to produce protein fibers that can be formulated into synthetic meat. The technical objectives also include demonstration the feasibility of crosslinking muscle fiber proteins extracted from meat with mycoprotein from mushroom to produce desired textural and flavor properties.

    \ Phase I project is to radically increase the efficiency of plant agriculture,\
    \ with far-reaching implications for both humans and native ecosystems. Agricultural\

    \ to a combination of crop breeding and genetic engineering, adoption of chemical\
    \ fertilizers and pesticides, and irrigation. By expanding understanding of plant\
    \ developmental biology, the technology developed via this project will increase\
    \ productivity by 300-fold over current practices via high density cultivation\
    \ of only the edible fruits of plants, not the supporting roots, leaves, or stems.\
    \ The innovation will enable indoor fruit production independent of local climate\
    \ and growing seasons. Controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will alleviate\
    \ food insecurity and food deserts, creating a decentralized, resilient global\
    \ food production system, even in industrial areas or non-arable land. Concurrently,\
    \ land formerly used for conventional agriculture can be restored to natural ecosystems,\
    \ and water supplies will no longer be subjected to contamination by agrichemicals.\
    \ Additionally, controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will combat climate\
    \ change by making soil management unnecessary, which could decrease annual greenhouse\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address challenges of animal farming through cell-based meat production. Approximately 30% of the Earth’s surface, 70% of all arable land, and 29% of the global freshwater supply is dedicated to animal farming. Livestock is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major threat to biodiversity. 70% of all antibiotics used in the United States are used on farm animals and contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Cell-based meat development is estimated to generate significant reductions in greenhouse gases and use of land, water, and energy, as well as antibiotics in meat production. The proposed project aims to develop novel technologies that will accelerate cell-based meat development.

    The proposed project develops a novel scaffolding material for the generation of animal tissue, specifically skeletal muscle. The proposed project will ultimately advance current scientific knowledge on the mechanisms underlying tissue generation and elucidate the molecular principles governing cell adhesion, differentiation, and growth of animal cells during tissue development. Key technical objectives include demonstrating that the proposed scaffold can be successfully customized to harbor any cell adhesion molecule of interest, and proving that a novel biomaterial can be adapted as a tissue-culture-grade reagent. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to ascertain the extent of animal cell adhesion and growth on the proposed scaffold. These studies will advance understanding of animal cell interactions with their extracellular milieu, and how environmental molecular properties and cues are tuned to influence de novo tissue development in vitro.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is faster and accurate detection of Salmonella species in food processing plants. Salmonella bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of foodborne illness. Food contamination in processing facilities can lead to serious public health problems as well as costly recalls of millions of food units. Rapid and accurate sensing technology is currently lacking for definitive detection of Salmonella in food-processing plants, which delays initiation of appropriate control measures and increases the likelihood of spreading contamination and foodborne illnesses to consumers. This technology will enable more frequent testing throughout the entire manufacturing process at reduced costs. It is fully expected that this technology could be applied to the detection of other pathogens.

    The proposed project will create and test a rapid (20 minutes), hand-held, sensitive (1 bacteria cell per milliliter) platform to enable food-processing facilities to detect Salmonella on site. The innovation of this technology lies in the ability to avoid bacterial enrichment (22 to 48 hours to allow bacteria to grow), while still sensitively and selectively detecting Salmonella species. The device uses a testing cartridge to bring bacteria directly to a detection surface, which consists of graphene printed or scribed on a test-strip and subsequently functionalized with Salmonella-specific antibodies. Unique laser processing induces a 3D-structured surface at the nanoscale level in graphene that becomes highly conductive for biosensing and for antibody attachment, which are desirable properties for enabling low detection limits and increasing test sensitivity. These technologies can be combined into a portable platform to make a user-friendly handheld biosensor and displaying quantitative counts of bacteria. The integrated platform (test strip and cartridge) will be designed to interface with existing portable electrical readers in much the same fashion that diabetics monitor blood glucose levels at home with a blood test strip that connects to a portable reader with a digital display.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ companies, there are around 1,700 Asset Integrity Managers who spend $320 million\

    \ validation of the prototype in the laboratory, validation of the prototype with\
    \ real-world samples obtained from different oil and gas environments, and continued\

    \ (SC-ZRA) that allows users to directly investigate the impact of microbial growth\
    \ on corrosion.  One chamber contains an unsterilized field sample, while the\
    \ second chamber contains the same field sample that has undergone sterilization.\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate and improve the development and optimization of enzyme products.  This project will develop a platform that reduces costs and delays associated with research.  These enzyme products will improve the cost, safety, and sustainability in a range of applications, such as biomass processing, animal nutrition, solid and liquid waste management, household and industrial cleaners, and enzyme replacement therapies.  This solution will support the growth of the $10 billion enzyme market.

    The proposed project will advance a fluorescence-based enzyme activity-sensing platform, by reducing barriers to development of new industrial biocatalysts, enabling the rapid design of hydrolytic enzymes for industrial and specialty markets through the development of modular enzyme activity probes. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research and development are (1) determining performance metrics (limits of detection, speed, accuracy) relative to existing characterization techniques, (2) determining effects of sensor preparation methods on sensor performance, and (3) developing a robust reader for field use. The goals of the proposed research and development are to (1) provide parity data to current assays for end-users to engender confidence in our approach, (2) standardize production protocol, and (3) provide hand-held reader that is inexpensive (<$3000) and can withstand rough handling in field. At a high level, these goals will be achieved by (1) testing our sensors on a panel of candidate enzymes that have rigorous characterization already (to establish performance metrics), (2) using designed experiments to screen process space of sensor preparation and model effect on sensor performance attributes, and (3) using a design-build-test engineering framework to test reader components and layout.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines, scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.  This project advances a peptide production system.

    The proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure, novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and purification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved sustainable food production. Mycotoxins are common contaminants found in cereal grains that can track through feed production and ultimately poison livestock animals. These poisoning events manifest as waste and inefficiency within human food supply chains. Animals consuming contaminated feed grow more slowly, produce less milk/eggs, are more susceptible to disease, etc. This equates to lost profits for the famers, lost meals for the consumer, and concerns over long-term food security. This SBIR Phase I project addresses this challenge through detection of these toxins. This technique offers a potentially transformative new tool in the field of point-of-source diagnostics, while simultaneously addressing the needs of the industry. This toxin detection system will be faster, simpler, and more versatile.

    The proposed project advances a new generation of mycotoxin detection technologies. This technique employs novel compounds designed to associate with a specific mycotoxin of interest to enable reliable quantitative detection. These detector compounds operate by changing the spectroscopic properties of the toxin, such that it can be detected even in complex biological mixtures like animal feed. The project investigates the extraction buffer composition and the detector compound design. The buffer and detector compound combinations will be optimized by characterizing the spectroscopic signatures under different excitation conditions.  This research program will target the two key classes of mycotoxins most relevant to industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.

    The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve measurement science.  Currently, special low-pressure chambers known as "vapor cells" are made by hand in a select number of precision glassblowing shops and suffer from poor dimensional reproducibility, low production capacity, irregular sizes, and variable vapor composition leading to a multifaceted limitation in the marketplace. Optical frequency references on the market today are large, costly, and power-hungry, but are used in a variety of commercial opportunities throughout industrial metrology markets. This study aims to produce a repeatable recipe suitable for high-volume production of miniature vapor cells. The results of this study will lead to the scalable production of references that would be intrinsically trustworthy and perform well in a continuous manner over many years.

    This STTR Phase I project will leverage micromachining of glass and silicon to enable a new fabrication method for a traditionally handmade component: a glass-blown vapor cell. The research objective of this study is to test if such a method can yield a compact and reproducible vapor cell. Research will employ semiconductor processing techniques and optical frequency metrology to deduce the long-term stability and accuracy of these vapor cells in order to assess their suitability as optical frequency references. The anticipated technical results of this study include a potential pathway to a mass-produced optical frequency standard suitable for optical clocks, interferometers, and wavemeters. Such a technology would underpin accurate measurement science in high-performance optical measurement equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat arthritis in joints. This project will advance the use of special materials for joint repair, which permit devices to mimic the naturally soft tissues of the body and provide anatomically correct support. These materials also offer the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, development of patient-specific devices. It will offer the ability to arthritis in joints in the foot, hand, knee (e.g. total knee replacement), spine (e.g. total disc replacement), and repair of any load-bearing orthopedic tissue, such as meniscus.

    The proposed project focuses on advancing the translation of Liquid-Crystalline Elastomers (LCE) as a cartilage replacement device for the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint to treat hallux rigidus. Hallux rigidus is a joint disorder at the base of the big toe. This project will be the first to investigate LCEs for orthopedic applications and develop an MTP joint repair using LCEs. LCEs have vastly superior energy dissipation properties relative to traditional elastomers, such as silicone or hydrogels. This project will demonstrate LCEs for treatment of degenerated joints by drawing from the disciplines of liquid-crystal elastomer science, viscoelasticity, and bioengineering. LCEs are known for behavior that is similar to biological tissues. This proposed project will accomplish: 1) synthesizing an LCE to mimic mechanical properties of natural joint to minimize wear rate under simulated physiological conditions; and 2) validation of biomechanical performance and biocompatibility of LCEs in comparison to the state of practice.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve research in the life sciences. This research often uses confocal and fluorescence imaging technologies to capture high-resolution, high-contrast images of biological samples. However, these methods traditionally require high levels of illuminating light, resulting in damage to tissues, disruption of normal processes like cell division, and competing with the light being measured in the experiment.  The proposed solution will improve the collection of light in these microscopes.  This will allow researchers to minimize damage to samples, thus removing current experimental constraints and enabling the development of new and far-ranging applications on an already powerful research platform. The proposed technology will be useful for disease and pharmaceutical research.

    The proposed project will involve the development of a simple, add-on, mirrored sample chamber unit capable of enhancing confocal microscopy capabilities by substantially increasing microscope fluorescence collection efficiency limits. This will require overcoming design challenges because the use of mirrors to collect and refocus emitted light has rarely been attempted in confocal microscopy. The proposed R&D work includes: 1) sample chamber and mirror design and prototyping, 2) design of mounting hardware and integration with an existing confocal system, and 3) exploration of compatible modalities, including Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy. Completion of the proposed objectives will lead to the development of a device that increases the light collection efficiency beyond the current 40% limit, is compatible with any detection objective, and does not require a separate optical path to the detector.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the growth and processing parameters of a methane-reducing seaweed feed additive for ruminant livestock (i.e,. cattle). Globally, livestock methane emissions contribute up to 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%. The proposed project will advance this as a feed additive at scale by exploring three novel solutions for natural lighting optimization in land-based cultivation systems, profiling and integrating aquaculture wastewater (AWW) as a circular nutrient stream, and deploying an alternative processing method to the energy-intensive industry standard. These growth processes can likely be applied to algae production for other uses, such as food, while drying innovations are expected to be broadly applicable in tropical climates.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will build on work to grow Hawaiian Asparagopsis taxiformis in land-based systems and optimize for both yield and concentration of desired metabolites. Diurnal changes in solar position and irradiance, along with occlusion caused by algae self-shading, result in photosynthetic inefficiencies.  AWW contains large amounts of waste nitrogen and phosphorus; only 20-30% of nitrogen from the fish feed is retained in fish biomass. The integration of AWW will recover some of these nutrients and avoid downstream consequences of pollution, such as eutrophication. While drying material is important for the production of a shelf-stable product, existing technologies are either energy-intensive or perform poorly at retaining critical compounds in seaweed tissue. The project will test proposed solutions to this quandary, as well as contamination and strain development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make 3D cameras for long-range LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) more affordable, widespread, and as reliable and simple to use as cameras found in common mobile devices. 3D cameras (LiDAR) are being used for precise positioning and velocity determination of objects in augmented reality applications and are crucial for widespread adoption of autonomous cars and trucks where the 200-300 meter range is required. Eye safety concerns with low-cost silicon sensors force the long-range autonomous vehicle customers to use one pixel at the time or limited field of view imaging using high-cost and complex systems based on materials that require specialty materials and manufacturing. This technology will enable the use of mainstream materials and process technology for the long-range autonomous vehicle segment without compromising eye safety. This capability will reduce cost, lower complexity, and improve reliability of long-range 3D cameras and help propel the autonomous vehicle industry into widespread adoption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a fully complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatible single photon avalanche diode (SPADs) based on germanium that operates at eye safe wavelengths. Current germanium-based avalanche photodiodes require cryogenic cooling due to excessive dark noise from tunneling or dislocations.  They suffer from poor absorption at the eye safe wavelengths beyond 1450 nm. This project will implement a photon trapping strained heterostructure device architecture which reduces dark counts while enhancing absorption at the operating wavelength. The device structure will be developed with particular emphasis on the semiconductor growth process. The experimental results will be benchmarked to the dark count and absorption requirements for the mass-market, long-range autonomous vehicle application. The technology will offer a highly manufacturable, lower cost alternative to compound semiconductor based SPADs that are often prohibitively expensive to produce in large arrays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that the proposed Geometric Unified Learning (GUL) technology, consisting of reusable building blocks, overcomes several disadvantages of deep learning methods and brings increased value to end-users by: 1) saving time and resources in data processing, since GUL has an auto data cleaning and compressing capability; 2) fitting data before it is input to a deep neural network to avoid overfitting since GUL can search and learn simultaneously and select the most important data to use; 3) providing transparency and trustworthy solutions that can easily be understood by data-to-decision makers; 4) making data analysis interesting for software developers, scientists and engineers outside of the machine learning field since GUL outputs are comprehensible; 5) producing flexible, robust and agile solutions for debugging since GUL’s components can be decomposed or re-organized to form new solutions for different problems; and 6) saving money since GUL runs faster in parallel and only uses around 1% of the original data points.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has several intellectual merits that address several technical challenges in deep learning, such as garbage-in producing garbage-out, needing large volumes of training data, long running times, unexplainable outputs, excessive parameter tuning, then repeating until the desired results are obtained. GUL, rooted in differential geometry, creates appropriate local (GUL) coordinate systems, Riemannian (GUL) metrics, transformations, and geodesics to identify data invariants, intrinsic patterns to engineer and design GUL data adaptors, characteristic extractors, and measurements that can be reinforced to be better each time an end-user runs their data. The GUL tools have capabilities of vectorizing data, compressing data, searching and learning simultaneously, with highly interpretable results. When the technology makes predictions it will show the user exactly which data points are responsible for those predictions.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve drone control. Current controllers are effective in specific environments but perform poorly in environments and flight conditions such as turbulence, thereby narrowing the scope in which drones can be used.  This project will advance a plug-and-play solution in which users can focus on higher-level tasks specific to their use case, like obstacle avoidance and route planning. This new controller has broad applications in both commercial and military settings: it enables stable flight across a wide array of environments, expands the flight envelope in turbulent conditions, and allows for longer missions due to increased control efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of drone control in turbulence through the development of a reinforcement learning-based flight controller. The project will enlarge the design envelope for quadcopters as well as provide a system and environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to other control problems. Contemporary systems rely on Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controllers as an essential part of stable flight. These PID controllers rely on holistically tuned, static functions to convert maneuvering commands into voltage changes across drone motors to meet the rotor’s targeted rotation speed. In lieu of statically defined PID equations, this novel controller uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a subset of machine learning where an agent is trained to select actions that maximize a reward across an environment. This technique has led to greater-than-human performance across a variety of different control and game theory tasks, but little is known about how these techniques fare when replacing PID control systems. The primary advantage the development of a reinforcement learning controller would have over simpler PID controllers is the ability for the user to view drone control at a higher level of abstraction, thus mitigating the need to focus on the minutiae of flight control for complex missions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of printable electron transport layer (PrETL) materials to greatly simplify the production of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and significantly lower their manufacturing cost.  OLEDs are found in an increasingly broad range of commercial products, such as televisions, portable devices, automotive lighting, flexible luminaries, and displays.  Current commercial OLED manufacturing technologies typically require methods that are expensive, energy intensive, and slow. The biggest barrier preventing the transition from thermal evaporation to printable technologies has been a lack of commercially available printable electron transport layers. The adoption of PrETL technology will allow manufacturers to eliminate the thermal evaporation steps and enable fully-printed OLEDs at a fraction of the cost of current devices.  This development will spur further penetration of OLEDs throughout the lighting and display market, providing the benefits of improved energy-efficiency, reduced eye-strain, flexible forms, minimal heat production, and lower cost device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of efficient, long-lifetime, printable electron transport layers (PrETLs) for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the feasibility of PrETLs and PrETL-enabled, fully printed OLEDs.  The innovative PrETLs developed here rely on a solution processable hexacoordinate silicon-based scaffold, that can be synthetically tuned to the electronic and material needs of the manufacturer. The Phase I project will develop PrETL thin films for material and electronic testing and for building prototype OLEDs enabled by PrETLs.  The ultimate anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase I research will be a fully printed PrETL-enabled OLED with an external quantum efficiency greater than 10% and a lifetime of 10,000 hours at 1,000 nit brightness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improving the safety and reliability of autonomous systems with affordable high-precision instruments.  Due to high component cost and extensive manual assembly, improvements in high-precision inertial navigation equipment has traditionally been slow, with system prices actually increasing instead of decreasing as in most other high-technology products.   An affordable yet highly accurate gyroscope will open a $10 B market opportunity in autonomous systems applications, and it will provide disruptive, more compact new technology into the $2 B existing high-performance inertial navigation market.  Possible market applications include sensors for consumer electronics, automotive safety systems, industrial robots, and national security systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new 3-D Silicon Nitride bandgap waveguide to enable small, high-precision integrated optical gyroscopes.  Traditionally, on-chip Silicon Nitride waveguides are short centimeter length structures with optical loss on the order of a 100 dB per meter making them unsuitable to fabricate long gyroscope waveguides.  Gyroscope waveguides typically require a spiraled sensing waveguide greater than 40 meters long to generate the sufficient Sagnac Phase for performant operation.  Additionally, there is a trade-off between tight pitch waveguides that fit more sensing area per die, and the errors generated from optical phase coupling between neighboring waveguide spiral tracks.  This SBIR will demonstrate a novel 3-D bandgap structure and process methodology to densely pack an ultra-low loss waveguide that will enable an approximate 400x improvement in optical loss and a 4x improvement in waveguide density versus conventional Silicon Nitride waveguide approaches found in today’s standard CMOS process.  The results of the Phase I is a key-enabling technology for small integrated optical gyroscopes as well as other photonic devices that require low loss on-chip optical waveguides.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable next-generation engineered optics employed in augmented and virtual reality (AVR) devices. Engineered optics manufacturers currently deposit polymeric thin films and imprint and cure them with transparent molds and UV light. Such polymeric films often have high costs and sub-optimal optical performance. Novel high-index materials are required for device miniaturization and increased field of view.  This project will provide AVR manufacturers with cost effective methods to fabricate high refractive index transparent photonic devices that would otherwise be impossible or cost prohibitive to manufacture by methods currently available.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will expand the knowledge base of high-index, UV-curable precursors that can be used for engineered optics.  UV-curable polymeric-nanoparticle composite materials represent the current state-of-the-art to produce optical waveguide components for augmented and virtual reality (AVR) applications. These coatings often suffer from low-optical transmission, increased haze values, high coefficients of thermal expansion, and low-indices of refraction. This project develops UV-curable, inorganic films that exceeds the standards of currently used materials. This research project will focus on elucidating correlations between precursor formulation and film processing to control film thickness, refractive index, and optical transmission.  The proposed research objectives will reproducibly demonstrate materials with controlled optical performance that that meets or exceeds the current state-of-the-art and establish a pathway for manufacturers to achieve device miniaturization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will revolutionize vertical transportation for skyscraper-class buildings (150 meters or taller). The skyscraper-class segment of the total addressable global elevator market is estimated at $8 billion for installation, driven by two key trends: urban densification and aging societies. It is expected that the number of people over 65 will increase by 33% by 2050 and that upwards of 70% of the world’s population will live in urban centers by the end of the century. This demographic shift will create an new demand for space in densely populated urban areas, skyscraper-class buildings within, and associatd vertical transportation systems.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a cable-less, tractive drive system to propel an elevator cab. Equipped with a tractive drive system, cabs become self-propelled, high-performance electric vehicles that are not bound to a single shaft, but instead navigate autonomously throughout multiple shafts. In addition, the absence of cables allows multiple cabs to travel within the same shaft, enabling greater transport capacity and shorter wait times to be achieved using fewer shafts. The tractive drive system propels cabs using frictional forces developed between the tractive drive wheels and the shaft. The objective of this Phase I project is to construct a proof-of-concept prototype that will allow for (1) direct measurement of the frictional behavior of the tractive drive wheel and shaft material combinations for the expected scale, geometries, and ambient operating conditions, and (2) verification that the expected mechanical performance (i.e., load-bearing capacity, power transmission) is achievable. This demonstrates the feasibility of such a system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the deployment of solar power in the United States. The technology can potentially make solar panels up to 16% more efficient and result in up to 10% lower costs. This enables solar power to potentially become more economically viable across larger parts of the United States. This technology can serve the existing 110 GW solar panel market. Global commercialization of the technology can increase solar energy production by 14,000 TWh and reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by 6 billion tonnes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a light conversion material that combines a light absorber material, a wide bandgap inorganic perovskite, with a highly efficient, quantum cutting near-IR emitter, a ytterbium dopant. The material is applied to existing solar panel components using a rapid vapor deposition process to create drop-in replacements, avoiding changes to the panel production process.  Traditional silicon solar panels poorly convert ultraviolet light into electricity, generating substantial waste heat and degrading panels.  The light conversion materials developed here utilizes that traditionally wasted light, thereby boosting overall panel efficiencies.  This project will confirm the feasibility of the technology for solar applications by building coupon solar modules, measuring power performance improvements, and confirming intrinsic device stability through environmental stress tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of modular power sub-systems (power-stacks) that will enable a new generation of power inverters that are compact, re-usable, upgradable, resilient against die-supply shortages, and can be manufactured faster and cheaper. As the world migrates to sources of clean energy and the further electrification of industry, transportation, and homes, there is a significant and growing demand for electric power converters. Widespread adoption of clean energy requires that these converters be simple, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Today's designs are inconvenient both for end customers and for converter suppliers, as they typically are: complex, large, heavy, inflexible, expensive, and slow to market.  Current inverter are often made by only a few specialized companies and  have high technical barriers to entry for inexperienced entrants. Additionally, current inverters are locked to power-die suppliers, making scale-up and  re-use challenging. The proposed project will develop and test a novel approach to enable inverters to meet new market demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel approach to power conversion problems.  High speed operation of high-power semiconductor switches typically generates significant heat.  The novelty of the proposed innovation  over current technologies resides in moving the point of electrical isolation from adjacent to the power-die to adjacent to the coolant, and massively integrating the power path, the control path and thermal path into scalable building blocks.  An additional advantage is the ability to develop new manufacturing processes to build and integrate these blocks reliably. The outcomes of this project may be a design and manufacturing approach that results in 50% reduced development time and development cost, 80% lower weight and size, a $100-$200 per unit cost reduction, increased scalability, and improved resilience to die-supply shortages.

    \ Phase I project will be to empower researchers to make bio-structure discoveries\
    \ by eliminating computational bottlenecks to shorten drug discovery cycles and\
    \ time-to-market, such as those needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most modern\
    \ drug discovery projects start with protein target identification and verification\
    \ to obtain a 'verified drug target'. Structural vaccinology is a rational approach\
    \ to generate an effective vaccine. For instance, knowing the structures of the\
    \ proteins on the surface of the virus can guide vaccine design, and knowing the\
    \ structures of viral enzymes can lead directly to drug treatments that inhibit\
    \ replication. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a method to image important\
    \ structures. The proposed innovation enables fast classification of images and\
    \ creation of 3-dimensional structures by using advanced deep learning techniques.\
    \  This will accelerate analysis and discovery by more than 50%. \n\nThis Small\

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new rapidly dry-sanitizing technology for disposable single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) and other articles in a manner that preserves material integrity and function to enable multiuse during pandemic and post-pandemic times. It will promote energy and water conservation, and reduce plastic waste significantly. This ozone-based sanitization technology will benefit all frontline workers regularly exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The need for rapid sterilization technology is likely to grow to mitigate social distancing configurations. Schools, daycare centers, health and fitness facilities, factories, and airports will need to implement sterilization protocols. With this technology, clothes, face shields and masks, phones, smart devices, and all manner of personal articles can be easily sanitized in less than ten minutes. The market for small industrial-scale waterless appliances with the capacity to offer on-demand sterilization may also expand rapidly. While ozone is used in a wide range of sterilization technologies, there is currently no consumer-friendly dry washing machine.  Thus, this project may also support development of an eco-friendly and effective laundry solution. Together, the sanitization and safety tasks will advance this technology as a viable waterless sanitization device, with the distinct advantage of lower cost, compact size, operational ease, and accessibility.

    The proposed project advances translation of a low-cost, rapidly deployable gas-based field sanitizer that does not require water, solvents, or detergents. To combat infectious viruses and odor-causing bacteria, this technology must meet aggressive benchmarks set by federal regulatory agencies for ozone emissions while achieving the highest bioburden reduction levels short of an autoclave. This project will optimize the ozone dose (ppm and time of exposure) required for viral inactivation and testing mask fit and filtration efficiency after repeated exposure to high ozone concentrations. The device will also incorporate new containment and neutralization technologies to meet environmental safety requirements. The device performance will be characterized by monitoring the exhaust for residual ozone during and after operation.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project addresses the monitoring needs via wastewater-based epidemiology of current and emerging viruses that pose high risks to public health. With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic situation and the recent emergence of the coronavirus variants, one common concern is that the virus variants are more contagious than their predecessors, and will likely spread quickly within communities without early detection and warning. Other concerns are that future mutations may not be covered by existing vaccines, in which case early monitoring through high resolution wastewater-based epidemiology will become one of the only effective means of providing early alerts of the presence of such mutated virus variants within local communities. With a wide adaptation of the proposed instrumentation by municipalities, large and small communities such as college campuses and senior care facilities, the project enables the early detection and monitoring of the current coronavirus and its variants during the pandemic. The technology can also be extended to other emerging viruses with risks of community spread in the years to follow, not only in wastewater but also in widespread environmental and recreational water quality monitoring.

    The proposed project is a highly-optimized reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach for in-situ sampling and analysis, and the realization of a corresponding instrumentation platform that is applicable to the early detection and monitoring of different viruses, including the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and other emerging viruses. The proposed technology aims to reduce the time-to-result compared to current wastewater-based epidemiology approaches while minimizing cost and logistics.  The effort will include the testing of several protocols that are amendable to adaption for automated in-situ SARS-CoV-2 measurement, followed by the selection and optimization of the most suitable one. The protocols will be subsequently tested and validated using spiked samples, along with appropriate positive and negative controls. The approach will implement, for the first time in an automated device, the latest advances in molecular biology protocols, such as extraction-free single-step RT-qPCR. The project strives to achieve the first in-situ RT-qPCR available, with the potential to completely revolutionize the fields of wastewater-based epidemiology, general environmental testing and source tracking.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project relates to the unmet need for new and effective therapeutics that target the lung. This proposal outlines a novel treatment for the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19; however, this technology will also find use in other acute pulmonary disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Currently the options for treatment of pulmonary disorders include supplemental oxygen, ventilators, or nitrous oxide (NO) gas, which is toxic and cumbersome to use. Current technology uses gaseous NO which is a toxic gas supplied in high pressure tanks and is present only when inhaling the gas. The proposed project will develop a long-lasting, inhaled NO delivery system to improve lung function of patients suffering from ARDS brought on by COVID-19 or other causes.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances translation of a novel molecule which sequesters NO chemically as a stable solid and can be engineered to degrade at a controlled rate for in situ continuous release. This proposal develops NO donors with optimized performance and stability for pulmonary delivery.  Tasks include: develop and test libraries of NO donor compounds for the ability and rate of NO release; evaluate and select compounds with good solubility characteristics to formulate for aerosolization/ nebulization; test candidates for improvement of lung function in animal models.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is a cost-effective way to manage and track viral outbreaks in animal, human, and plant populations, including tracking for situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.  It overcomes the challenges of current viral screening methods, namely PPE required for collecting samples, handling of samples to centralized analytic sites, cost of tests, and reliance on limited reagents.  The platform proposed in this project could be used on-site at an animal production facility or at home. The scanner can be placed at many municipal and commercial locations (e.g., drug stores) or the envelope can be conveniently mailed for assessment. The dual read modality gives timely feedback to the client, as well as the capability for anonymous aggregation of readout data - essential for real-time tracking of viral outbreak and informing resource allocation to mitigate spread. This diagnostic platform would generate impact, allowing: 1) animal producers to mitigate virus spread and reduce loss and 2) businesses, schools, and other organizations to make real-time data-driven decisions on closures and health policies.

    The proposed project focuses on assessing technical feasibility of three critical elements of a diagnostic platform: (1) the ability to couple isothermal RNA amplification directly to cell-free extract using custom formulations, to simplify usability (eliminate current off-card amplification with commercial kits) and reduce cost; (2) Production of a scalable and efficient cell-free extract well-suited for amplification of reporter proteins by RNA circuits to increase the rate of protein production and reduced RNA degradation.  The performance of this extract will inform the time to result as well as the cost of card, necessary metrics for translation; and (3) production of new toehold riboregulators (2 to 3) selective to virus targets relevant to the animal industry (e.g., swine flu, porcine respiratory).  These will also inform the limits of detection.  This project will evaluate the feasibility of such as system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a new probe to detect low levels of viral load, such as that causing COVID-19.  Rapid and reliable kits are not currently readily available. This project will provide rapid detection of viral material using exsiting cost-effective techniques with fewer detection errors. Being able to quantify and track viral loads at low concentration and high accuracy will expedite tests, reduce false negatives, and accelerate vaccine and drug development to combat COVID-19, and future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop innovative fluorescent probes based on high-brightness fluorophores/dyes (HBFs) that offer tunable extinction coefficients up to several thousand times higher than commercial dyes. Based on this HBF platform technology, we will be able to create high-brightness qPCR probes that can specifically quantify viral RNAs by strong and tunable fluorescent signals at fewer amplification cycles and minimum replication errors. The activity, efficiency, and specificity of high-brightness qPCR probes will be evaluated in the project.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an easily distributed and adopted approach to find cells used to manufacture antibodies. Many of the antibodies used today for diagnostics and therapies are produced using cell lines. Selection of the cells that produce the most antibodies in a stable manner is required to bring new diagnostic and therapeutic products to market faster and with lower costs. However, the tools and approaches used to identify and pick cells today are extremely slow and/or expensive, often requiring costly custom equipment. The goal of this project is to develop a product that enables a user to identify individual cells that produce the most antibodies with equipment already present in their labs. This would enable more small pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and research labs to develop stable cell lines for antibody production and could have immediate impact in enabling distributed development and production of antibodies during pandemics, such as COVID-19.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a reagent-based workflow to perform single-cell antibody secretion assays that is user-friendly and easily distributed. The ability to analyze and select out single cells based on secretions is critical for the rapid development of monoclonal antibody therapies. A key challenge is the screening of producer cell lines for productivity, which can take months and require significant time and effort. Existing systems that try and address this problem require specialized expertise or commercial equipment that is not widely available, so the number of cells that can be analyzed remains small.  This project focuses on developing a microparticle, reagent-based product that can isolate single cells, concentrate and analyze their secreted products, and sort individual cells based on secretions in high-throughput using standard flow cytometers. The key technical objectives of this project are to: develop microparticle product formulations optimal for standard cells used to produce high quantities of antibodies, compare the system performance to current approaches, and use the system to create a cell line producing high amounts of a potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a technology to support social-emotional health by fostering co-presence, defined as a sense of being together in a virtual environment analogous to person-to-person physical interaction. Loneliness can be debilitating and have detrimental impact on patients aged 65 and over, causing an estimated $7 billion in Medicare costs associated with the effects of morbidity and mortality factors, such as dementia, heart disease, stroke, and depression. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the challenges and opportunities of digital tools in fostering connections associated with mental and physical health. The proposed virtual reality solution and the emerging digital therapeutics sector can address significant challenges faced by hospitals, assisted living care facilities, and mental health facilities, improving clinical outcomes.  The findings of this project are expected to impact other human interaction contexts, such as training, education, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances translation of digital therapeutic tools to foster co-presence.  The project compares physiological and psychological markers between pairs of individuals in both real and virtual contexts in search of significant markers for co-presence. Objectives include development of a custom virtual reality application and collection of quantitative data on pairs of individuals interacting in three social contexts. Proposed research will evaluate the degree to which virtual reality fosters co-presence and focus on specific algorithms and design choices as significant drivers of co-presence.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate development of a digital infrastructure trust layer for public health data around monitoring and responding to COVID-19 public health objectives. This project will provide both trust and accessibility through the application of blockchain technology to public health data to transform it into verified, legally weighted, and tamper resistant data upon which decision makers in the public and private sector can benefit. This innovative combination of new technological solutions will allow for better products, data analytics, predictive modelling systems, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) responsiveness based on organized and trusted systems. Since public health statistics are used by private enterprise as well as the public sector and the general public, the addition of a trust layer to public health data more widely is important as fidelity in statistics is critical to effective individual and organizational action.

    This project’s goal is to develop tools and practices to make authoritative, reliable data available, enabled by cryptographic techniques and accessible to a broader set of individuals and organizations. The scope of the project looks to develop aggregation, access, and reporting systems which can support new decentralized economics, such as smart contract marketplaces, while remaining interoperable and accessible to users of legacy technology. The solution requires creation of a single, trustworthy platform that combines research, development and commercial application of emerging blockchain approaches with a suite of supporting technologies and systems including: distributed data infrastructure, flexible delivery methods, intuitive interfaces, and analytics tools. This research hopes to allow for the creation of novel resources to support the trustworthiness and consequently, the fundamental usefulness of all public health data records. The expected outcomes include: improved data integrity using blockchain-backed systems, tools enabling accelerated innovation in data driven decision making, and a prototype marketplace for COVID-19 resources managed by blockchain.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research SBIR project will be to transform the ability to control cross-contamination by pathogens via hands and gloves in the healthcare and food sectors and strengthen the nation’s response to the COVID-19 crisis by limiting its spread. This innovation will also reduce the healthcare-acquired infections from other pathogens that cause 1.7 million illnesses, 98,000 deaths and an estimated $45 billion annually in direct costs to US hospitals. Cross-contamination via hands and gloves is a leading cause of spread of pathogens and resulting infections. Handwashing and hand sanitizers provide periodic sanitation, however, cross-contamination via hands between periodic handwashing or sanitizing is an inherent risk. Likewise, donning fresh gloves helps ensure the gloves used are sanitary, but they become contaminated during use. Innovations described in this proposal provide continuous sanitation for hands between handwashing and between changes of gloves. Maintaining persistent antimicrobial activity for an extended period on hands and gloves of workers will reduce transmission of pathogens including SARS CoV-2. This research aims to develop cell-based antimicrobial compositions with diverse class of antimicrobials to coat both biotic surfaces (hands) and abiotic surfaces (gloves) for persistent antimicrobial activity.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the technical challenges in maintaining persistent antimicrobial activity on both biotic and abiotic surfaces against viral and bacterial targets including SARS CoV-2. The technical challenges include: (a) ability of antimicrobial compositions to persist on biotic and abiotic surfaces in the presence of organic content including proteins, lipids and cells as well as physical factors including sweat and mechanical forces; (b) achieving rapid inactivation of contaminating pathogens on complex surfaces such as hands and gloves; and (c) ensuring the biocompatibility of the compositions and removal with simple washing steps.  To address these challenges this proposed research aims to develop innovations in the following technical areas: (a) discovery of cellular compositions and process engineering to stabilize diverse antimicrobials and maintain rapid inactivation of pathogens (b) development of nature inspired designs for retaining cell-based antimicrobial compositions on skin surfaces to maintain persistent antimicrobial activity (c) engineering polymer compositions to retain cell-based compositions on abiotic surfaces and (d) engineer cellular compositions to achieve rapid inactivation of these pathogens. This may be achieved based on engineering affinity of the carrier compositions for pathogens as well as the release rate of antimicrobials from cell-based carriers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccine for COVID-19. The fastest-to-clinic vaccine for COVID-19 was mRNA-based; however, there are no mRNA-based vaccines on the market currently. This is, in part, because this class of vaccines is difficult to optimize and manufacture at a large scale. If clinical trials are successful, hundreds of millions of doses will be needed in the U.S. alone. This STTR project aims to pioneer a novel technique to manufacture mRNA-based vaccines initially for COVID-19. This technology is highly modular, allowing for the better understanding and optimization of this class of vaccines. Importantly, this new technique can be scaled to manufacture the doses needed both for the current COVID-19 pandemic and in the case of future outbreaks. The flexibility and scalability of this platform technology provide a durable competitive advantage. Following demonstration of preclinical efficacy, the company will work with an established pharmaceutical partner for testing and manufacturing. Capturing 5% of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine market would bring an estimated $125 million in revenue. This is a beachhead market, and, once successful, the company will expand into other mRNA-based vaccine and therapeutic markets.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop an mRNA-based nanoparticle vaccine for COVID-19 without the use of cationic materials. Current formulation methods require cationic lipids or polymers to form charge-based complexes with the anionic mRNA. Charge-based assembly limits the accessible nanoparticle surface chemistries, a feature crucial to directing which cell types will be transfected and the resulting immune response. Additionally, mRNA is only a minor component of the resulting formulations. The proposed formulation method decouples the mRNA encapsulation from the nanoparticle surface in a two-step process. The method does not require cationic materials, allowing for mRNA loadings up to 5-times higher than those achievable through other routes. However, mRNA transfection has not previously been demonstrated without the use of cationic materials. This will be achieved by completing three key milestones: (1) optimize mRNA encapsulation, (2) vary surface coatings to enhance dendritic cell uptake, and (3) demonstrate efficient cell transfection. A highly loaded nanoparticle formulation that can efficiently target and transfect dendritic cells is desired. Following the completion of this Phase I work, this formulation may be applied to a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-coding mRNA to produce a COVID-19 vaccine.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a state-of-the-art, counterfeit-proof security technology to enable vaccine manufacturers to tag, track, and authenticate vaccine products throughout the supply chain. The tagging process will be amenable to its integration into a scalable glass vial manufacturing process. Digital information such as product, lot number, expiry, etc. may be embedded into the tags, if desired. In light of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, security and authentication of vaccine dosages throughout the supply chain represents a significant public health and global logistics challenge. Industry concerns over vaccine theft and counterfeit products drive the market need for an effective ID security technology that enable manufacturers to authenticate vaccines in a safe, covert, and efficient manner. The tagging process developed in this program will add minimal expenses to the manufacturing cost of each vaccine dosage form, at an estimated cost of pennies per dose.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will require the completion of several tasks, including: 1) the computational design of the taggant patterns, 2) the development of a scalable tagging process, 3) the development of instrumentation and associated software for tag authentication, and 4) the encryption of tags with digital information such as lot number, expiry, manufacturing location, or any other desired product information. In summary, the specific design parameters of the tag will be elucidated and optimized during this Phase I effort. The design parameters will subsequently be demonstrated on flat glass and glass vaccine vial prototypes using a scalable process. Finally, newly developed “reading” instrumentation will be used to authenticate the tagged glass prototypes, demonstrating the overall utility of this anti-counterfeit technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of a patient-friendly and cost-effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection arising from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The inability to quickly stop the spread of respiratory infectious pathogens can have devastating global consequences, resulting in millions of deaths and creating an enormous economic burden. This project will prove the viability of an aerosolized pan-coronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. An inhalable therapeutic has a stronger commercial potential than the currently approved monoclonal antibodies which require intravenous delivery, and this drug will be more likely to retain potency against future variants. The COVID-19 virus is expected to persist in the human population, and novel variants thereof will continue to emerge. Therefore, this technology could be crucial in addressing these ongoing medical needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of an inhalable decoy receptor that would effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its endogenous cellular target and thus prevent infection of the host. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. The decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface. Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a solution for the students and schools with an urgent need for a remote learning solution.  An estimated 85% of families on rural Native American reservations do not have high-speed internet access. The need for a remote learning solution is especially pressing given the COVID-19 pandemic which is requiring many schools to implement online or hybrid learning models. If students are not able to participate in these new models, it is likely that they will have substantially lower achievement levels than their peers who do have access to remote learning. The proposed project advances a technology to enable online learning without access to high-speed internet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new system to support digital learning with lower access to high-speed internet.  First, this project will explore edge computing in innovation by building a new learning management system that has intelligent edge nodes capable of providing a complete student learning experience without access to a central server. Second, it will improve pedagogical approaches in this environment, supporting digital learning across limited or no access modalities, including print-to-digital workflows.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the state-of-the-art for detecting, prioritizing, and responding to misinformation online. As more platforms are moving to end-to-end encryption, it is critical that new tools and algorithms are developed to respond to misinformation on these platforms. Encryption on platforms such as WhatsApp, Viber, LINE, Telegram, and Signal protects the communications of millions of Americans but also potentially allows rumors, misinformation, disinformation, and other threats to spread. This project builds ‘misinformation tiplines’: online accounts that allow users to check potential misinformation with leading fact-checking organizations. The proposed algorithms will allow Americans to check potential misinformation with fact-checking organizations allowing them to identify dangerous—and for health misinformation sometimes life-threatening—misinformation online. The project empowers users of online communication platforms and improves their safety while maintaining the benefits of end-to-end encryption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will overcome key challenges in order to allow tiplines to scale efficiently to millions of users. Tiplines require a thoughtful combination of artificial intelligence and human knowledge. The same misleading claims are often repeated and restated in many different ways online. In order for tiplines to scale, it is necessary to identify the claims being made in messages submitted to tiplines and match them against the extensive library of existing fact-checks. Claims can be in the form of text, image, video, or audio messages and expressed in many different human languages. In this project the company is building the algorithms needed to match these claims across languages and across formats. The results break new ground in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide new tools to evaluate and enhance teaching of higher-order critical thinking.  This project will leverage advanced machine learning models to generate critical-thinking questions for any text a student reads, analyze their written response, give them immediate feedback on how to refine their thinking, and ultimately provide data-driven insights to their teachers. The capability to automatically interpret open-ended responses using artificial intelligence (AI) is a rich area for the educational community.  This project will deepen the education community's knowledge in this area and apply the findings to K-12 education. In particular, the results may lead to a new evaluation architecture relying less on multiple-choice questions and related techniques, enhancing education with a method to efficiently evaluate and provide feedback with open-ended and short-response questions. This project will address the problem of using multiple-choice assessments to assess ‘learning’ and move to more accurate ways to ascertain the nuances of learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on automated short-answer scoring to solve a pressing and largely unsolved problem. Most work in automated scoring focuses on longer essay grading, which is more relevant for higher education. At this time, there are no general-purpose algorithms available for short responses. Adding to the technical complexity is the fact that this project’s machine learning approach needs to work for any book or text, and include questions written by any user. This project will improve the accuracy and detail of assessments, particularly with written responses regarding texts new to the reader. This project will require deep-learning natural language processing (NLP) technology to fully model language representation. The proposed system will ingest the subject text and the associated question before evaluating the written response without prior submissions used as training data. The project prototype will be developed for English Language Arts instruction prior to broader deployment across other disciplines.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical outcomes for patients needing valves for vascular (veins) or urinary systems.  It is difficult to make artificial versions of the fluid control elements, such as valves, that are biocompatible and withstand the physical forces associated with their function, as well as the changing environment associated with aging. The proposed project advances a system to make artificial sutureless devices.

    The proposed project will optimize the materials and variables of manufacturing a polymer valve integrated with durable polymer encapsulation of a structural Nitinol frame. This Nitinol-polymer structure must withstand long-term challenging in vivo conditions while maintaining a physical interface that does not experience premature delamination and loss of device functionality. Polyurethane materials have excellent mechanical properties for rigorous applications and history of use in implants. This project explores the phase space of relevant parameters for manufacturing and deployment of these valves at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a low-cost infrared imaging device that enables real-time monitoring of agricultural products for crop management and product quality inspection. Handheld and drone-mountable spectroscopic tools are gaining traction, but their limited spectral range fails to directly measure the unique identifiers of crop maturity and quality such as oil and sugar contents. Furthermore, this innovation, as a platform technology, will address a broader need of the infrared community for lower cost detector arrays and enable system integrators to develop camera systems to increase the safety of driver-assisted vehicles, improve the reliability of advanced manufacturing techniques, and enhance national security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a photodetector array produced using infrared-tunable semiconductor nanocrystals, or colloidal quantum dots. Unlike crystalline semiconductor technologies, these colloidal quantum dot inks are fashioned into photodetector devices directly on the electronic circuits using inexpensive solution coating techniques, which enables the development of a small pixel pitch focal plane array with a spectral range from 1000-2500 nm and pixel resolution greater than 640x512 to address market opportunities in low-cost imaging systems. The Phase I project objective is to develop a colloidal quantum dot detector array that competes on performance with existing technologies for shortwave infrared sensing and is compatible with vacuum packaging techniques by controlling the impact of engineering factors such as surface chemistry, reagent concentration, and process temperature on the performance and thermal stability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to realize significant cost savings for domestic natural gas producers, enabled by recycling wastewater that would otherwise be disposed of via expensive transportation and permanent injection into the ground. While the domestic production of natural gas is a central pillar in the transition to a cleaner energy economy, a detrimental by-product is contaminated wastewater, known as produced water, which comes to the surface in large volumes mixed with the gas. In regions such as the Marcellus Basin, the largest natural gas reserve in the United States, the only viable option is to truck this water long distances to disposal wells, where it is re-injected, for a cost that comprises large portions of the operational budget. By developing a new technology for the treatment and re-use of this water at the well-site, this project aims to provide a low-cost, environmentally sustainable solution. Doing so would reduce water management costs as much as 50%, lowering gas production costs, and conserving billions gallons of water through re-use that would otherwise be lost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project aims to develop a new type of filtration membrane technology capable of removing critical contaminants from produced water, while providing the required durability, minimal footprint, mobility, and feasible cost to enable commercial water recycling for natural gas producers. Currently, no suitable technical solution exists for the economical recycling of produced water. This project focuses on a new type of ultra-durable silicon membrane that combines the filtration ability and low-cost of polymeric membranes with the resilience of ceramic. Through the strategic manipulation of the membrane fabrication approach, including catalyst deposition and chemical etching process parameters, efforts will focus on reducing pore size and increasing pore density in the membrane. The primary objective of the work is to enable the removal of critical contaminants from produced water, and to maximize filtration throughput in order to ensure a small footprint. Successful completion of the project will result in the advancement of the technology to the field-testing stage.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is faster turnaround time for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing results. Routine testing of nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed globally to try to control the spread of the virus. Ideally, the results of this testing will be done and reported within 24 hours, preferably less. Unfortunately, testing results have commonly been taking 2-3 days or even longer due to case backlogs. Successful development of the technology from this research should ensure much faster reporting of results by reducing the primary bottleneck of sample preparation of COVID-19 testing. In addition, this research should greatly improve the ability to analyze saliva samples by rapidly enriching the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the virus, and this should therefore lead to greatly reducing false negative results (especially for pooled samples).

    The proposed project utilizes a patent pending membrane device for rapidly automating sample extraction. The use of these devices allows for samples to be introduced under vacuum, and RNA to be enriched in less than 10 min. The extracts can be rapidly dispensed into multiple 96 or possibly 384 well plates for high throughput analysis. The enriched RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva will be ready for sensitive analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to detect social-emotional issues in children (ages 5-12) for early intervention. A growing trend in juvenile mental health concerns was exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruption in child development. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) system that learns from interactions with the child and parent independently and can detect potential social-emotional concerns.  The ML system enables personalized evaluation and monitoring outside a clinical setting in a remote or hybrid context.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances algorithms for integration into a social-emotional skill building curriculum.  The project proposes: 1) User segmentation based on a comprehensive assessment of social-emotional functioning, 2) Correlation of the relevancy and effectiveness of modules to segmented users, and 3) Collection of information to identify social emotional deficits (red flags). These activities enable a feedback loop to learn and deliver recommendations for each child-parent dyad, personalizing learning in real-time. These algorithms learn from behavioral, social, and emotional inputs from both the parent and child when they engage with the technology. The system will also detect red flags correlated with social and emotional deficits, promoting early intervention.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable an alternative to traditional nanofabrication which relies on structuring material in two-dimensional layers. These processes often limit the current design-space and prototyping/manufacturing methods with not only what can be made, but also the time and resources required for development, relegating viable commercial applications to only high-volume markets. These shortcomings will be addressed by developing a new form of nanofabrication 3D-printing capable of rapid-prototyping and mass-manufacturing photonic components with cheaper systems enabling the mass-customization of components that can more rapidly address market needs in both low- and high-volume markets. Products developed using this nanofabrication process for photonics components may address inefficiencies in datacenters with low-loss optical interconnects, as well as enabling complex optical filters, near-eye displays, and ultracompact lenses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a nanofabrication process for optical and photonic components to be fabricated with large changes in refractive index at nanoscale resolutions into any 3D geometry with graded control. The process uses volumetric deposition of nanomaterials consisting of high refractive index dielectrics into a patterned polyelectrolyte gel scaffold which, once shrunken, improves both resolution and density of the patterned materials. By utilizing two-photon lithography and linear shrink factors the process can achieve feature sizes below 25nm while allowing for the creation of gradient patterns in any 3D geometry. Combining this patterning and shrink strategy with a method to volumetrically deposit high refractive index dielectric nanomaterials will allow for a degree of control over refractive index never before possible; allowing light to be sculpted in 3D with unprecedented control.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project supports the development of a medical device that enables minimally invasive graft-based reconstruction of the urethra as a long-lasting treatment for male urethral stricture, a class of conditions causing restrictions in flow. Approximately 1% of men on Medicare are treated for stricture annually, and an estimated 1 in 5 men will get a stricture in their lifetime. A urethral stricture progressively narrows the urethra - leading to urinary urgency, frequent and painful urination, and impaired intimacy. The current state of practice has many challenges:  Widely available endoscopic treatment is simple and minimally invasive but rarely curative, with high recurrence rates, and repeated endoscopic intervention worsens the stricture and turns a curable condition into a chronic disease, with devastating consequences to quality of life. Graft-based urethral reconstruction has excellent long-term outcomes but limited availability – as the complex open surgery is performed by a select group of reconstructive urologists. The proposed medical device simplifies minimally invasive graft-based urethral reconstruction to empower general urologists to deliver minimally invasive curative treatment.

    The proposed project focuses on demonstrating the anti-migration properties of a temporary indwelling urethral device prototype. The device is designed to deliver a graft to a urethral graft bed, and hold it in place as the graft adheres over a period of 14 days without migrating. Proof-of-concept studies of the mechanically functional prototype will be performed on the bench and in vivo, to be further advanced by integrating proprietary anti-migration features. Key milestones include the prototype's ability to meet: targeted biocompatibility/cytotoxicity benchmarks, anti-migration benchmarks using an in vitro model, and an absence of significant migration in vivo over a 14-day period.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a life-saving treatment option to patients suffering from a specific heart condition called tricuspid regurgitation (TR). In the US, 1.6 million patients need treatment for life-threatening TR, and no good medical, surgical, or transcatheter therapy exists. Current solutions lead to bleeding complications, damage to the circulatory system, or inability to deliver the device. This project will develop a novel device to address these constraints with a method that can be manufactured at scale, resulting in significant cost savings to the healthcare system and improved quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will enable the development of a new transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device and novel technology to produce 3D physical vapor deposition (PVD) nitinol thin-film leaflets. One of the main challenges in valve development is a design that can be compressed into a catheter successfully. The use of a thin film rather than the standard of pericardial tissue will significantly reduce the volume of the valve material, enabling a much smaller delivery catheter profile. This study addresses critical developmental objectives, such as manufacturing feasibility and thin film leaflet characteristics. The solution will be optimized for material fatigue life, valve characteristics, valve durability, and anchoring to validate it for medical use.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to build a non-invasive device that can deliver sufficient electrical signals to activate the intrinsic circuits controlling bladder and sphincter function. This technology will reactivate the previously-dormant neural circuits. Current medical approaches focus on management of symptoms, rather than restoration of function. Indeed, they often completely obliterate one function of the bladder (sensation, storage or emptying) in order to facilitate the other. Noninvasive spinal neuromodulation offers a different approach, with a focus on functional restoration, not functional management.

    This project addresses a condition that impacts the quality of life of millions of Americans. Urinary incontinence, recurrent urinary tract infections and dependence on catheters for bladder emptying are some of the bladder problems experienced by people with paralysis. The company seeks to stimulate the spinal cord in a noninvasive manner called Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation. In preliminary studies, it was demonstrated that this therapy can reduce detrusor overactivity to increase bladder capacity and reduce episodes of incontinence, and facilitate retraining of the sensory component of bladder control to improve sensation of fullness. This project will focus on a reconfiguration of the device to make it compatible with home use. This reconfiguration includes designing a portable device for home use, testing and confirming electrical safety of the more compact design, and comparison of waveforms with prototype devices. This device has the potential to become a novel therapy for the treatment of Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction (NLUTD). If successful, for the first time, this technology will give NLUTD patients a modality to improve their bladder symptoms without the side effects of medications or risks of invasive procedures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the prototyping and verification pipeline for advanced semiconductor products that require multiphysics simulations. This will impact the design of multi-chip modules, emerging semiconductor devices, and novel analog circuits, all of which are likely to form the basis of next-generation electronics. Current electronic design automation (EDA) software used by semiconductor companies often cannot be used to design these technologies as EDA often lacks sufficient modular and detailed models, such as thermal and mechanical physics. This project will develop a new EDA software toolset to address these needs, allowing designers to dramatically reduce development cost/time and open the door to new products that are currently too challenging to design.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop physical modeling algorithms to link new physics into the electronic design automation (EDA) pipeline. Existing modeling tools for components, such as transistors in state-of-the-art technologies, employ either slow finite element analysis or highly specialized compact models. These limitations will be overcome by developing new algorithms to convert complex physics into efficient modular models. This project will produce an EDA tool based on the new algorithms that (1) are generalizable to a wide range of components without manual tuning, (2) have high accuracy, and (3) execute fast. This EDA tool will be integrated into the EDA toolchain, retaining interoperability with existing design and optimization software. The performance of the integrated EDA tool will then be validated against circuit simulations of op-amps and finite element analysis simulations of multi-chip modules in order to demonstrate fast and accurate system evaluation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to address the security challenges that currently exist in integrated circuit (IC) design and the electronic design automation (EDA) software market.  It will create a platform for ‘secure-by-design' of integrated circuits using untrusted third-party intellectual property blocks. It will provide a tool to semiconductor designers to automatically analyze security vulnerabilities and address them before fabrication. Such a capability will lead to security improvement of the fabricated chips and the systems they are integrated into, while also reducing the cost and time for secure system design through automation of vulnerability analysis and mitigation. The proposed toolset will address a critical technology gap in the semiconductor design and EDA marketplace.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a netlist assessment toolset which analyzes gate-level netlist of third-party integrated circuit (IC) design blocks used in modern system-on-chip (SoC) designs.  The toolset converts the gate-level netlist to readable formats to support the existing security analysis tools in the electronic design automation (EDA) software market.  During gate-level security analysis, this toolset will enable the detection of vulnerability for piracy, reverse engineering, as well as malicious logic in a design. To make the toolset market ready for our customers in the EDA and semiconductor industry, the SBIR/STTR Phase I project will mainly focus on scalability testing, interface design, analysis of security benefits, and performance improvement. Scalability testing of the toolset will be performed internally and with EDA industry customers to demonstrate the capability of the toolset in analyzing and converting the gate-level netlist of large scale SoCs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new semiconductor manufacturing process to work "beyond Moore's law". The broader impact and commercial potential of the proposed activity is to reduce the barrier to manufacture highly integrated components for 5G and future wireless technologies, including base stations and satellite communication.  This will enable new devices that produce higher power and operate with better energy efficiency than current solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will commercialize a heterogeneous integration process to combine electronic solutions greater than the capabilities of their constituent parts. Incumbent silicon processes cannot produce transistors capable of the power handling of III-V technologies such as Gallium Nitride (GaN). However, III-V technologies, such as GaN, are niche devices for specialized market needs. When products require both silicon and compound semiconductor components, chips are arranged in multi-chip modules with large parasitics and interconnects that prohibit high-frequency (RF and millimeter) applications. Affordable heterogeneous integration of diverse material systems on a common substrate remains an elusive capability in modern processes. The research objectives of this project are to demonstrate heterogeneous integration of III-V devices on a silicon substrate for a millimeter-wave product. The research will investigate the large-scale manufacturing limitations of transistor integration. The project would design, fabricate and test RF passive components and matching networks in silicon interposers to be used in conjunction with III-V transistors.  These approaches will be demonstrated on a 28 GHz power amplifier product for emerging 5G radio applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the ability for developers to build massively collaborative and real-time cooperative video/virtual reality applications without compromising end-end security. Lack of end-to-end encryption has been a growing problem for consumers, educational institutions and businesses collaborating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will advance the state-of-the-art by providing developers with the necessary tools to create high quality synchronous collaborative virtual environments where children, teachers, corporate professionals and even national security personnel can safely engage in work-activity without risks of privacy loss or security/data compromises. This will also benefit telemedicine where privacy is paramount from a personal perspective and also from a legal standpoint. The success of demonstrating end-end encryption for a high-performance application will result in other remote-work collaborative tools being designed with end-end security as a key feature.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project solves the problem of maintaining end-end security of content while allowing expressivity using a scripting language by separating the data plane from the control plane for such massively collaborative multimedia applications. The control plane can be programmed using a web-friendly language that can be executed on any existing user-device such as laptops/smartphones thus giving maximum portability to the app developers. The data plane always stays end-end encrypted and can be manipulated using the scripting language in a highly expressive manner. The system provides perfect forward and backward secrecy by using a fast-group rekeying protocol to maintain confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the multimedia content. Research and development on this project will lead to breakthroughs in multiple avenues including the demonstration of a truly high performant decentralized end-end encrypted application. This will spur the demand for end-end security for any remote-work collaborative application.
