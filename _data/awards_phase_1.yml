    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make laparoscopic and robotic assisted abdominal surgery safer for patients, and less costly for the healthcare system.  Though a somewhat rare complication, inadvertent bowel injury during the more than 15 million laparoscopic procedures performed annually can be catastrophic for patients resulting in extended hospitalization, multiple corrective surgeries, lifelong medical complications, and, in more than 5% of cases, death.  In addition, the direct costs associated with this complication can be substantial including intensive care convalescence and the potential for litigation given the nature of damages suffered by patients. Intraoperative detection of bowel injuries during surgery provides a simple, yet elegant solution enabling immediate repair and avoidance of negative outcomes. This project?s commercial potential includes availability in more than 49,000 operating suites and an addressable market of $750 million per annum. The proposed innovation will significantly enhance patient safety, reduce costs associated of corrective care, and generate revenue from U.S. based manufacturing.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable intraoperative detection of bowel injuries by identifying gases typically sequestered to the interior of the gastrointestinal tract. To accomplish this, these target gases must be sufficiently differentiable from background gases and other agents typically present during laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Such background agents present a meaningful technical challenge in that they present the potential for false positive detection results. Characterization of all potentially present agents will be completed such that they can be sufficiently differentiated from target gastrointestinal gases. A high precision gas chromatography system and custom fabricated chamber replicating surgical conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity and gas flow rate will be used to precisely identify and distinguish all potentially present gases. Once all potentially cross-reactive gases are characterized, a combination of physical filtration and algorithmic signal processing will be used to ensure proper differentiation/recognition of gas species and avoidance of potential false positive results.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is in development of fully-biodegradable disposable personal care products, particularly menstrual pads. In general, menstrual pads cannot be recycled or be composted by municipal facilities after use because of issues with the biodegradable hot-melt adhesives to construct and position them. Biodegradation may be the best way to reduce the environmental impact associated with them, particularly in geographies where municipal solid waste facilities are underdeveloped.  Ultimately, non-toxic, safe and effective disposable menstrual pads could improve quality of life for menstruating women and the environment, and provide a new commercial opportunity for producers in the US and around the globe.

    The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of synthesizing a combination of biodegradable thermoplastics and biological additives that will create a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). This PSA must performs well in commercial hot glue application machinery as well as in the intended products, completely and safely degrade within six months of use, and is commercially viable at scale. These parameters have yet to be met by biological-based adhesives. The research approach is as follows: First, develop and synthesize PSAs using a biological base polymer and biological-based biodegradable additives, including plasticizers, tackifiers, and compatibilizers to enhance the performance of the PSAs. Second, characterize PSAs based on established use and manufacturing requirements and optimize the composition to ensure the requirements are met. Third, test PSA compositions for degradation, including length of time required for complete biodegradation under landfill, soil, and water conditions, including marine environments.  Identify intermediate chemical molecules and structures that form as a result of the biodegradation process, determine their potential hazards on both the environment and the health of biological organisms.  This project will develop a biodegradable PSA that will meet manufacturing and performance standards in menstrual pads and show that the PSA can be fully biodegradable in less than six months under non-specialized environmental conditions, without the need of mechanochemical or photo degradation processes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.

    The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of printable electron transport layer (PrETL) materials to greatly simplify the production of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and significantly lower their manufacturing cost.  OLEDs are found in an increasingly broad range of commercial products, such as televisions, portable devices, automotive lighting, flexible luminaries, and displays.  Current commercial OLED manufacturing technologies typically require methods that are expensive, energy intensive, and slow. The biggest barrier preventing the transition from thermal evaporation to printable technologies has been a lack of commercially available printable electron transport layers. The adoption of PrETL technology will allow manufacturers to eliminate the thermal evaporation steps and enable fully-printed OLEDs at a fraction of the cost of current devices.  This development will spur further penetration of OLEDs throughout the lighting and display market, providing the benefits of improved energy-efficiency, reduced eye-strain, flexible forms, minimal heat production, and lower cost device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of efficient, long-lifetime, printable electron transport layers (PrETLs) for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the feasibility of PrETLs and PrETL-enabled, fully printed OLEDs.  The innovative PrETLs developed here rely on a solution processable hexacoordinate silicon-based scaffold, that can be synthetically tuned to the electronic and material needs of the manufacturer. The Phase I project will develop PrETL thin films for material and electronic testing and for building prototype OLEDs enabled by PrETLs.  The ultimate anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase I research will be a fully printed PrETL-enabled OLED with an external quantum efficiency greater than 10% and a lifetime of 10,000 hours at 1,000 nit brightness.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project addresses the monitoring needs via wastewater-based epidemiology of current and emerging viruses that pose high risks to public health. With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic situation and the recent emergence of the coronavirus variants, one common concern is that the virus variants are more contagious than their predecessors, and will likely spread quickly within communities without early detection and warning. Other concerns are that future mutations may not be covered by existing vaccines, in which case early monitoring through high resolution wastewater-based epidemiology will become one of the only effective means of providing early alerts of the presence of such mutated virus variants within local communities. With a wide adaptation of the proposed instrumentation by municipalities, large and small communities such as college campuses and senior care facilities, the project enables the early detection and monitoring of the current coronavirus and its variants during the pandemic. The technology can also be extended to other emerging viruses with risks of community spread in the years to follow, not only in wastewater but also in widespread environmental and recreational water quality monitoring.

    The proposed project is a highly-optimized reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach for in-situ sampling and analysis, and the realization of a corresponding instrumentation platform that is applicable to the early detection and monitoring of different viruses, including the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and other emerging viruses. The proposed technology aims to reduce the time-to-result compared to current wastewater-based epidemiology approaches while minimizing cost and logistics.  The effort will include the testing of several protocols that are amendable to adaption for automated in-situ SARS-CoV-2 measurement, followed by the selection and optimization of the most suitable one. The protocols will be subsequently tested and validated using spiked samples, along with appropriate positive and negative controls. The approach will implement, for the first time in an automated device, the latest advances in molecular biology protocols, such as extraction-free single-step RT-qPCR. The project strives to achieve the first in-situ RT-qPCR available, with the potential to completely revolutionize the fields of wastewater-based epidemiology, general environmental testing and source tracking.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to make the intensive care unit (ICU) safer for patients and less burdensome for nurses through the development of an illuminated intravenous tubes (IVT) for easier and error-free delivery of medications, enabling better care generally as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic. IVT identification requires an inordinate amount of nurses? time and confers an immense cognitive burden as it requires manual tracing of the line from pump to patient. The errors associated with manual IVT tracing are costly, contributing to increased ICU length of stay and hospital liability. The current pandemic has exacerbated these issues as ICU admissions are rising and the use of enhanced isolation requiring extended IVT. Successful completion of the proposed program will support the development of an extended illuminated IVT that allows for reliable identification of IVT from pump to patient through the use of a fiber optic cable that nurses can turn on and off as needed when identifying lines. In comparison to the manual tracing of lines, an illuminated line has the potential to provide more rapid and error-free identification of IVT lines, thus reducing the impact of errors on patients, decreasing associated medical costs, and improving nurse workload.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I Project will advance the development of a novel lighted intravenous tubing (IVT) device to allow nurses to quickly and accurately identify IVT through the use of a light-emitting fiber optic cable attached to the outer wall of the IVT. Management of IVT and medication delivery, requires nurses to manually trace lines from pump to patient, which is an error prone process and particular interest for ICU patients that require upwards of 10 or more IVT lines simultaneously. The proposed program will advance the development of the extended illuminated IVT through the execution of two objectives. The first objective is to engineer the device to ensure that illumination can be maintained over the length of an extended line used in isolation settings. The second objective is to assess the performance of the extended prototype in a simulated ICU setting with enhanced isolation. Successful completion of the Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of the extended illuminated IVT device in an isolation critical care setting as defined by reduced nurse burden and time in motion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to improve public health.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment (PPE), including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), have been critical to containing disease spread and protecting first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. Shortages of FFRs have led public health agencies to provide guidance in favor of FFR decontamination and re-use as a crisis capacity strategy. This project seeks to develop a cost-effective approach to support sterilization and re-use of personal protective equipment at the point-of-care. The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the high cost and poor safety of Lithium-ion batteries in new energy applications. Low-cost and safe batteries will improve economic viability for solar energy storage, which is critical to increasing renewables penetration to above 30% of total power generation. This project advances a battery material to provide lower cost, higher safety and improved cyclability compared to currently used materials. This can support new batteries in applications including electric vehicles, grid-tied and solar storage, and consumer power tools, among others.

    This SBIR project proposes a novel nanostructured LiMn2O4 cathode chemistry (ND-LMO) that offers ~30% lower $/kWh cost compared to incumbent nickel managanese cobalt oxides (NMC) materials. Furthermore, it will have iimproved performance parameters, such as cycle life, a safer heat generation profile, and a 10% greater amp-hour capacity between full state of charge and maximum depth of discharge. Many of these improvements stem from the ?intercalation-pseudocapacitive? properties of finely nanostructured electrode materials. Technical challenges, such as inactive and deactivating surfaces, synthetic costs, and others, must be addressed for these systems to be commercially viable.  The project?s proposed composition and methods used can be applied to other material systems.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce injury, property damage, operating\
    \ costs, and liability in the built and natural environments.  Excessive snow,\
    \ rain, wind and seismic activity create high structural loads that can lead to\
    \ the collapse of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.  These loads can\
    \ also destabilize geographical features such as water impoundments and hillsides.\
    \  Increasingly extreme climate impacts and aging infrastructure make these situations\
    \ more common and unpredictable.  Weather events affect 5.9 million commercial\
    \ buildings and 137,000 schools in the US.  Of the 600,000 highway bridges in\
    \ the US, 45,000 are structurally deficient. Landslides result in $3.5 billion\
    \ in repair costs due to physical damage and result in 25 to 50 deaths annually.\
    \  Since small structural movements often precede damage and even catastrophic\
    \ failure, the ability to detect and monitor these motions at key locations and\
    \ deliver warnings to any user with a cell phone or computer is of great societal\
    \ benefit.  This project will lead to the development of a low cost, rapidly installed,\

    \ team will construct a series of sensors that measure commercial rooftop movement\
    \ like that seen from high snow and wind loading.  Existing disaster forecasting\
    \ systems are expensive, operationally complex, and/or provide limited data. \
    \ The sensors in this project will use precision radio receivers to create 3 axis\
    \ centimeter-accurate movement data.  Sensors report movements to an application\
    \ server where an algorithm will be created to analyze and display geo-located\
    \ data.  When necessary, alerts are sent to users via Short Message System (SMS,\
    \ i.e., text) and email, indicating the location and severity of the problem.\
    \  A key metric to success will be the ability for the sensors to operate accurately\
    \ on structures such as metal-decked rooftops which can create challenges for\
    \ radio frequency devices.  A compact design is necessary for commercial viability\
    \ and to create a stable enclosure with low aerodynamic drag. Therefore, a novel\

    \ for output efficiency.  To reduce battery demands, algorithms will be developed\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an easy-to-use virtual reality (VR) toolkit to enable rapid development and deployment of educational VR experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the ?backward design? approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.

The proposed work develops a financial system to help cities and public utilities build infrastructure projects. This system integrates physical data with artificial intelligence and advanced monitoring systems. It will serve as a scalable analytics platform using environmental, economic, and social data for financing projects in water quality management.

    The proposed project develops analytics and a financial instrument for environmental adaptation and water restoration projects. It uses open-source data management, sensors and interfaces, and mathematical models in a system with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-enabled digital twin technology. The environmental data will be used in an integrated watershed model using principles of uncertainty analysis and neural network-based learning.   The econometric model combines uncertainty analysis with reinforcement learning where accuracy in prognostics is incentivized.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve shellfish production at scale and in an environmentally sustainable fashion, using oyster farming as a launching pad.  Today, most oysters are farmed nearshore under ecological stress.  This project advances the culturing of microalgae using internal waste streams and those from other food industries. The focus of this project is to process one of the most abundant, sustainable, and freely available industrial food wastes, spent yeast from breweries, to facilitate algae production at scale onshore and indoors. Although currently used primarily by the food and chemical industries, the less costly algal product could also energize areas of food and feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, biomaterials, and bioremediation services.

    The proposed project will advance the use of off-the-shelf bioreactors and a novel substrate which, along with CO2, form plant tissue heterotrophically in the dark as leaves do photosynthetically in the presence of sunlight. The proposed substrate enables production at scale of the single-celled microalgae that comprise much of the nearshore bivalve diet.  The yeast is fermented with both agriculture-grade vitamins and plant-based commodities.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve agricultural operations with respect to infection.  Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.

    The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal?s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal?s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable plastic recycling process. In the United States less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the remainder are incinerated (15%) or placed in landfills (75%). Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.  This project develops a low-temperature system for high quality, high-value plastic products in closed-loop recycling.

    The proposed project will apply synthetic biology and related biotechnologies to identify, engineer, and optimize new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.  These enzymes will enable closed-loop plastic recycling in an economically viable, low temperature, low CO2 emission process.   The first objective is to sample plastic contaminated environments for naturally occurring enzymes that have evolved to depolymerize PE and PET synthetic polymers.  Candidate PE and PET enzymes will be engineered to accelerate their ability to efficiently target and cut complex PE and PET polymers under scalable process conditions.  Millions of enzyme variants will be constructed, tested, and analyzed using synthetic biology, high-throughput screening, and machine learning technologies.  A primary goal of this effort is to demonstrate a 10-fold increase in PE and PET depolymerization rates compared to naturally occurring plastic degradation proteins.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves leveraging an innovative approach to deliver and monitor therapeutics more effectively. Real-time monitoring and tracking of immune and stem cell therapies is in its infancy. However, without the capability to precisely know where therapeutic cells localize, clinicians cannot assess safety, design optimal doses, or make clinical decisions related to therapeutic approaches. As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients. This proposal addresses a critical unmet need in the cell and gene therapy industry for rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic cells specifically to enable tracking in the body. The addressable market for preclinical and clinical cell tracking in clinical trials involving therapeutic cells in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $1.14 billion by 2024.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an innovative approach to intracellular delivery where mechanoporation or cell-squeezing is achieved simply by propelling cells, in the presence of exogeneous cargo, through a proprietary mechanoporation element that resides in a column designed to be processed in a centrifuge (spin column). End users will realize significant advantages over conventional and microfluidic approaches to intracellular delivery including: 1) Convenient spin column format; 2) Short cell processing times; 3) Ease of scale-up and multiplexing; 4) Applicability to numerous cell types; and 5) Compatibility with automated/robotic cell production systems including autologous cell production systems designed for clinical settings. Three objectives are proposed involving the generation of prototype spin columns and their use in optimizing aspects of element design to afford efficient intermolecular delivery of iron-based nanoparticles (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent) into T-cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells. The study will enable rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic and regenerative cells for in vivo tracking, empowering clinicians to make timely decisions with respect to treatment strategies, thus ensuring better clinical outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to mitigate healthcare costs and challenges associated with the nation's growing aging population. The outcome of this project will be a system that enables holistic, accurate, and faster monitoring of elderly people that will 1) improve quality of life and health of senior citizens, 2) address the future nursing shortage, particularly in the geriatric field, and 3) reduce healthcare costs. The proposed technology can impact a wide range of public health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health monitoring.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project applies real-time computer vision and sensor fusion processing for real-time continuous monitoring and analysis of health-related activities. In addition, this project takes an essential step beyond current solutions by analyzing seniors' group behavior and interactions with objects to determine whether they suffer from loneliness, behavioral disorders, or confusion states. This project utilizes multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize the discriminative power to understand human micro-body motions and thereby create a training framework for personalized behavioral understanding and monitoring. It also proposes an innovative solution to leverage the results of computer vision as attention feedback to thermal sensors to enhance the accuracy and robustness of thermal processing against temperature variations. Furthermore, the project offers an integrative edge-based Internet of Things solution to protect citizens' privacy while providing real-time continuous feedback to responsible personnel. The proposed system offers a novel user experience while protecting personally identifiable information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases, often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  An unbiased screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further enhanced binding to FcRn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to save water and energy across a wide spectrum of industrial and commercial applications (i.e. boilers, baking ovens, furnaces, proofers, HVAC systems) that emit wet exhaust into the environment. For example, the U.S. bread baking market segment alone may save over 50 million therms of energy and over 400 million gallons of water annually with the proposed technology.  The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon?s optimal performance at unconventional conditions. The non-linear phase-change heat transfer mechanisms will be defined and simulated, followed by a sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the channel geometry and thermosiphons array for subsequent prototype design and performance demonstration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make a new class of antibody-based immunotherapies that can be generally applicable to oncology patients. For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the creation of a "digital twin," a real-world system projected into spatially-computed environment such as virtual and augmented reality. This technology creates the infrastructure necessary for the application of virtual and augmented reality in industrial workplaces, at scale. By making the full-scale roll out of these technologies possible, the technology seeks to impact human health and safety, operational efficiencies, and environmental risk reduction for process operations facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The long term impacts of the technology may also enable automation and optimization, improving their efficiency, security, and safety. Such facilities are critical infrastructure and play a significant role in the national economy. The availability of this product may also enhance market opportunities for other businesses in the scanning, spatial computing, and training markets. The impact may be further broadened by adapting the process for digital twin production to new domains unrelated to the industrial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing knowledge and understanding in both machine learning and spatial computing. This project focuses on a method for digitizing a complex, real-world system, in an efficient manner, sufficient to recreate the captured reality as an interactive digital twin. The primary technical hurdle is the combining of different data sources that describe aspects of a particular real-world system into a single complete description. The initial physical systems being modelled are industrial process operations, but the core methods could apply to other types of systems, including natural systems, such as a rainforest. For industrial process operations, the goal is to encode the entire process operations facilities at the component level, with sub-cm accuracy, at 10% of the current time and cost requirements. To achieve this, this project will combine physical scans with engineering documentation and relational probabilities. Once combined, the model will be used as the basis for a digital twin of the real-world system projected into spatial computed environments, such as virtual and augmented reality. These techniques replace a tedious and impractical static scan and human labor workflow with rapid scans, computer vision, and a combination of procedural and trained algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of
    conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often
    uncomfortable in the early days because they aren?t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student
    personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be development of a novel platform for the design and high-volume fabrication of microfluidic devices for educational and research purposes. Currently used fabrication methods are not conducive to the large-scale production of robust, high quality, open-channel microfluidic devices that are cost-effective for widespread use outside of specialty applications. The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels. The kits will contribute to educational efforts that address the nation?s demand for STEM professionals, projected to grow at twice the rate of all occupations in the next 10 years, while training students in a field expected to reach a $60 billion market value by 2029.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to eliminate the main technical hurdles that prevent the large scale production of open-channel microfluidic devices. Current lithographic, additive and micromilling fabrication technologies require a combination of expertise, equipment and production time that make them ill-suited for the purpose of assembling devices that are inexpensive and robust enough for consumer use, for example, in educational settings. The proposed platform will leverage new and existing high-volume fabrication technologies to manufacture film-based devices with channels and chambers measured in the tens and hundreds of micrometers, featuring strong bonding between layers to allow for high pressure flow, and at a projected cost of <0.15 USD per device. Research objectives include the development of gravity-based and hand powered pump setups appropriate for educational and low resource settings. The advancements in device fabrication processes achieved in this project are expected to have a positive impact beyond the field of education, facilitating the commercialization of microfluidic technologies in fields like analytical chemistry, biomanufacture and point-of-care biosensing.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) ? often called ?forever? chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.

    \ Phase I project is in building climate resilience and promoting lower carbon\
    \ emissions in the agricultural food production system. The company seeks to develop\
    \ a seed coating technology that can extend the shelf life of plant growth promoting\
    \ bacteria (PGPB), also known as biofertilizers. Such coated seeds boost crop\
    \ yields and production, and reduce agricultural inputs (e.g. water, energy, fertilizers,\
    \ land use, and pesticides). The unique coating could alleviate abiotic plant\
    \ stressors such as soil salinity and drought, making the seeds more climate resilient.\
    \ The project will provide tools that will make it easier for microbe-based agriculture\
    \ companies to build and deploy their technologies more broadly. Current seed\
    \ coating and microbe preservation technologies are generally developed from the\
    \ non-renewable petrochemicals. These seed coatings are extremely hard to degrade\
    \ in the environment, ultimately forming microplastics that pollute the water\
    \ and land systems. Because of these problems, policy makers are banning petroleum-based\
    \ seed coating usage in the Food and Agriculture industries. The proposed seed\
    \ coating technology may fill in this gap as it uses biodegradable, naturally-derived,\
    \ and non-toxic materials. \n\nClimate change, soil degradation, and soil salinization\
    \ are emerging issues that have led to major societal problems around the world.\
    \ These societal problems include impacts on water, energy, and food security\
    \ (WEFS). Scientific discoveries in agriculture may inform innovative technological\
    \ solutions that mitigate these pertinent societal issues. This project will engineer\
    \ the seed microenvironment to encapsulate, preserve and deliver PGPB using biopolymers.\
    \  The proposed work may increase precision in microbe and nutrient delivery,\
    \ and lower the environmental impact of synthetic fertilizers through targeted\
    \ delivery and substitution with biological fertilizers. The technical research\
    \ and development will be focused on the development of biopolymer seed coatings\
    \ and tests of their efficacy in hydrated and anhydrous seed states. The experiments\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities. This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper insights into their customers? hair care-related goals, pain points, and health conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors (porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1) Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-esteem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reducing the cost of getting people online and connecting people in emergency situations such as natural disasters. Natural disasters often destroy cellular networks, exactly when people need communication the most. The influx of users on the limited remaining infrastructure often overwhelms existing resources, making it impossible for first responders to coordinate, for families to call their loved ones, and for volunteers to help. In other potential markets, the technology seeks to provide cellular phone access to parts of the world where it is now prohibitively expensive. This project seeks to develop small, portable cellular base stations that can provide access in both emergency and hard to reach and poorly resourced locations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project researches and implements a small, portable cellular base station. The technological focus for the base station utilizes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (or 2G and 2.5G) radio for communicating with a high density of cell phones in a computationally cheap manner while utilizing WiFi for local, high bandwidth applications. The technology implements many ?micro-cells? in lieu of the current macro cell approach to cellular coverage, blanketing the area with a high number of towers. This decentralized approach provides high reliability even if one or several nodes fail. This project will develop the algorithms necessary for interconnecting large numbers of base stations together and mesh the networking capabilities that provide radio links between each base station. Finally, this project will finalize the mechanical design and make the base station manufacturable at large scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration with a new type of three-dimensional (3D) sensor. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate in densely crowded spaces in a safe and socially compliant/acceptable manner. A key potential outcome is the development of a collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).  This method would be capable of handling dense crowds and optimized to run on compact and power-efficient embedded processors. Such abilities would increase the commercial potential and adoption of learning-based navigation methods that have demonstrated excellent collision avoidance and noise handling capabilities. The technology may unlock commercial opportunities by deploying AMRs in the airport, retail, healthcare, and hospitality industries, where the environments are highly dense and dynamic. The airport industry may derive postive impacts from AMRs that can navigate in complex, indoor environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are not allowed by providing contactless deliveries of food, beverages, and other retail products to travelers at the gate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a hybrid collision avoidance approach enabling autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate safely in dense crowds, while being socially-compliant in sparse scenarios. Preliminary research has shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches can compute collision-free robot velocities with inaccurate, uncertain perception data. The proposed DRL-based model will be implemented as an optimized neural network that works on power and cost-efficient embedded processors.  The key technical hurdles in this technology are: the DRL model trained in simulation may not perform well in real-world environments (known as sim-to-real gap), the fully-trained DRL model may have some performance degradation compared to the company?s current DRL models due to the lower number of parameters used to run on embedded processors, and the localization modules could compute erroneous locations when the AMR is navigating through a dense crowd due to occlusions. The key objectives of Phase I are to address these challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve reuse of wastewater.  This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.

    The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities?by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).  Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.  This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.

    The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.  The project will develop a test to measures a compound's biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content is commonly limited to very short clips (typically < 10 seconds) due to huge file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices. both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment and telecommunications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable. The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time. There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard HD video content.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safe, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy storage solution.  This project offers a non-chemical, non-hazardous alternative energy storage to accelerate grid modernization and non-polluting renewable power integration.  The project?s core technology is a design that is cost competitive with deployed Lithium ion (Li-ion) chemical batteries, but would be significantly less expensive per charge than Li-ion over its 30+ year service life.  This proposed approach allows the long-term advantages of kinetic (flywheel) energy storage (low service life costs, high power throughput, high daily charge cycles, no battery replacements, potential for 24/7 operations) and makes it affordable and safer for deployed stationary grid operations. With solar and wind renewables on par with traditional carbon-based power generation costs, affordable flywheel energy storage is vital to store and dispense intermittent renewable power, enabling the replacement of carbon-based power generation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a comprehensive testing effort to verify the technical feasibility of the project?s 3D flywheel composite structure for next-generation energy storage systems. The proposed research and testing objectives are to demonstrate the improved 3D flywheel performance and projected 9x reduction in the traditional flywheel weight for the same energy storage capability. Testing methodology includes dynamic balancing, torque transmission determination, critical failure/fatigue modeling, assessing magnetically coupled commercial external motor/generator power transmission and performance in a TRL-5 operational vacuum environment. The effort will also include energy storage market analysis for commercial market entry based on tested 3D flywheel performance. Anticipated results include the characterization of the 3D flywheel structural technology, demonstrated commercial subsystem operations and readiness to develop a full prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to improve the assessment of cognitive and motor skills in K-6 students. More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new class of batteries for transportation. The proposed battery design will maximize the rate of charge and battery lifetime while maintaining high energy density, in contrast with current battery research that primarily focuses on maximizing energy density. This new operating parameter will open the design space for smaller batteries that result in lighter weight, lower cost and longer life vehicle platforms to enable all-electric transportation. In addition, the new operating parameters enable the widespread adoption of two new applications, (i) vehicle to grid and (ii) mobility as a service. The associated reduction of greenhouse gases will be 1+ gigaton annually.

    The proposed project develops a lithium battery coin cell that demonstrates 3 minutes ultrafast charge and 20,000 extended cycle life performance, using the novel disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode. This project explores ultrafast charge lithium ion battery platforms.  Technical objectives include: 1) charging times comparable to filling up today's gas tanks; 2) batteries with a higher safety profile that last the entire service life of the vehicle; 3) vehicles that can connect to the electric grid for renewables integration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.

    The SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve capacitor technology in power conversion equipment used to electrify our transportation systems. Capacitors are critical components to the systems needed to accelerate the energy transition from petroleum to other fuels. This project will develop new electrical materials and production processes for capacitors. The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles. Through development of these new electrode materials and processes, manufacturing of capacitors in the United States will be available to serve the growing US electric vehicle industry.

    This goal of the proposed work is to develop electrode materials and roll-to-roll processes compatible with an integrated, continuous manufacturing process for multilayer capacitor products. By combining additive manufacturing process in a roll-to-roll system, sequential deposition, drying, and curing of alternating layers of dielectrics and electrodes will enable production of multilayer capacitors in a single system at atmospheric pressure. Electrode inks and printing processes used in flexible/hybrid electronics do not meet the specifications to replace vacuum-based evaporation or sputtering of thin electrode layers for capacitor applications. The primary approach will be based on adapting the layer coating and alignment techniques developed for dielectrics to conductive materials. These electrode materials will improve upon state-of-the-art conductive inks with poor interfaces between particles to produce dense layers with uniform thickness and low surface roughness. This project seeks to provide prototyping of multilayer capacitors produced in discrete processing steps for verification of electrical performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time ? a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve health care outcomes associated with complex procedures.  Approximately 1 in 7 major surgical procedures in the US is associated with a medical complication, totaling more than 4 million complications and $80 billion in costs per year. Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.  A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is inconsistently structured and not optimized to directly improve patient outcomes. The large datasets for most procedures provide only high-level conclusions regarding risk; they do not pinpoint the specific steps in provider workflow with high risk or the role of external factors, such as comorbidities or facility age. This project will determine the feasibility of using machine learning supervised by experienced clinicians to assess risk using principles from Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. The project will develop a proof-of-concept machine-learning system that uses a proprietary risk taxonomy and modifiers to combine national, state, facility, and actuarial datasets to generate risk priority numbers for each step for a service line. This system will then be applied to coronary artery bypass graft surgery to assess its validity and clinical value. Monte Carlo simulations and clinician focus groups using a Likert scale will determine the significance of the results.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the lab-on-a-chip and other related life science platforms by the introduction of a new standardized microfluidic chip interface. The proposed project advances a novel interface to advance the applications and capabilities of microfluidic chips in both medical and non-medical fields, including dramatically increasing the rate at which doctors and medical researchers can prepare and perform diagnostic tests. The interface enables easy interoperability of devices as the chips can be freely switched out while the result of the hardware remains the same. The success of this project could lead to great breakthroughs in bioenergy, medical diagnostics, and drug therapeutics.

    The proposed project undertakes the development of chip interfaces with reduced size and increased channel density by making use of novel interfacing and sealing methods, on a reusable micro-patterned surface. While the technology exists to fabricate microfluidic chips with much smaller dimensions, with more complex on-chip operations, and at a reduced cost, the current limitation is the size of the interfaces bridging the microscopic world of the fluid microchip with the macroscopic world of the laboratory. The work proposed herein could enable chips with 16x the density of sample channels, allowing for vastly more complex diagnostics to be performed and thereby vastly reducing the sample volume needed for accurate diagnostics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the success rates of cancer therapy, reduce the costs and duration of treatment, and to improve patients? life quality. More than 70% of the 16 million Americans diagnosed with cancer will undergo ineffective chemotherapy cycles through trial-and-error methods. On average, a cycle of chemotherapy costs $30 k and takes 12 weeks to complete; cancer patients undergo 5-6 cycles at a cost of an estimated $180 k. This project advances a method to pre-screen response to chemotherapy drugs so that clinicians can select the most effective treatment, consequently shortening the duration, reducing complications, improving outcomes, and reducing the financial burden. The technology uses a quick, single-step, scalable, inexpensive, and automated process that tests a wide range of drugs in less than a week. With this technology, the oncologist will be able to select the most effective chemotherapy drug for a cancer patient, on an individualized basis and prior to initiating treatment. The proposed personalized approach would reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles to 1-2, and save up to $120 k per treatment, generating annual national savings of $18.2 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development, proof-of-concept validation, and preclinical evaluation of an automated biochip platform that grows patients? cancer cells outside the body to screen them against chemotherapeutic drugs. In the research described herein, tumor specimens from patient biopsies will be grown and maintained as microtumors in the biochips to recapitulate clinical tumor behavior. The biochips and process will be optimized to create microtumors that can be used toward evaluating the performance of cancer treatment. Research objectives are to I) evaluate, refine, and optimize the design of the biochips through simulation studies to ensure compatibility with native tumor microstructure and mass transfer behavior; II) evaluate the formation, growth, and behavior of patient-derived microtumors in the biochips; and III) investigate the response of patient-derived microtumors to anti-cancer drugs in comparison to longitudinal clinical data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable the efficient emulation on classical computers of simulations carried out on quantum computing hardware. The proposed emulator technology is expected to address problems an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present using classical computing hardware. The emulator will be specifically designed for electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials. The successful completion of this project will disrupt the research and development associated with the use of quantum computing in the pharmaceutical and materials spaces by enabling faster assessment and development of quantum algorithms. Since it is widely accepted that these are impactful early applications of emerging quantum computing platforms, there is a paramount need for creating a user- and developer-friendly software stack specifically tailored for such simulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a quantum emulator on the basis of the so-called matrix-product-state (MPS) representation of fermionic wave functions. The innovation results from the fact that the proposed emulator will be specifically designed for fermions and therefore can take advantage of the physical symmetries inherent in these systems. The first-principles MPS wavefunction ansatz has been developed in the quantum chemistry community in the context of the ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) over the past two decades, and will be generalized such that the same APIs as used for the standard quantum emulator will be exposed to users. The proposed new software is expected to allow for emulation of quantum simulations involving 100 spin orbitals/50 electrons, or more, on commodity classical computing hardware, which is an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present. In this SBIR Phase I project, a Python prototype and associated command-line tools will be completed to demonstrate the technology and commercial viability.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project improves treatment of viral conditions, starting with influenza. Each year seasonal influenza infects 9?35 million individuals, causes 56,000 deaths in the U.S., and costs $87.1 billion.  The proposed technology has the potential to produce more rapid protection, expand pathogen/variant coverage, and extend the longevity of protection afforded by influenza vaccination and other vaccines. This added protection will reduce the high healthcare costs and productivity losses due to mortality/morbidity. This technology has the potential to serve as a rapidly deployable prophylactic or vaccine adjuvant to enhance protection and reduce the necessary vaccine dose, expanding access and providing a timelier response.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a next-generation vaccine adjuvant platform. While vaccines represent a major medical success, several diseases have proven difficult to address, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. One way to improve the efficacy of vaccines for these diseases is to use an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response to the antigen presented via vaccination. The proposed technology has the potential to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of infections directly and via heterologous immunity because the addition of ?Stimulator of Interferon Genes? (STING) agonist overproduction to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) serves a dual purpose: it enhances the elevated trained immunity of macrophages already known to be conferred by BCG and promotes critical antiviral IFN-I responses. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Optimize media and lyophilization for manufacturing of BCG-STING; 2) Evaluate the immunological effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 influenza vaccination; and 3) Assess the protective effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 vaccination. This will provide proof of concept for proceeding with the development of this novel recombinant BCG as an efficacy-boosting adjuvant that also offers intrinsic antiviral immunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to improve the outcomes of patients suffering sudden cardiac arrest. Approximately 650,000 cardiac arrests occur each year, representing the top reason for mortality and morbidity in the US and an estimated $33 billion a year for out-of-hospital costs. Overall survival remains generally below 10%, and patients are often left with significant neurological injury. Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) still remains one of the most effective treatments, resulting in better outcomes than current technologies. This project will develop a novel medical device that provides a novel superior automated CPR therapeutic system. It combines multiple methods of mechanical chest compression to improve patient blood flow during resuscitation.

    This project will advance preclinical research for developing the first clinically effective noninvasive automated CPR device. The system integrates a multimodal approach for delivering mechanical CPR, and therefore represents a significant advancement to current systems that only deliver a single mode of CPR. The automated and programmable prototype will determine the optimal combination of methods and timing, to control multiple pump mechanisms for applying mechanical chest compressions to improve patient outcomes. This Phase I project will conduct optimization studies in a swine model of cardiac arrest and develop a proof-of-concept model. These results will provide the foundation for the next generation system suitable for human use, as well as advance research results on the hemodynamic interactions of pump mechanisms and cardiac electrophysiology during CPR.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve cancer treatment. This project advances a new therapy that targets cancer cells and addresses their malignancies.  Following the initial application of lymphomas, the results obtained herein can be applied to several types of cancer.

    The proposed project will generate Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies to improve treatment for lymphomas.  Currently, these therapies show negative effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and metabolic exhaustion upon reaching the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, low nutrient availability for CAR cells in the tumor microenvironment decreases the efficacy. Therefore, strategies utilizing CAR therapy to help target the tumors and keep these cells sufficiently metabolically fit to perform their functions are beneficial.  The main goal of this project is to test the feasibility of generating biomaterials that maintain activation of immune cells in resource-poor environments. This project will generate CAR-macrophages and test the ability of our biomaterials to maintain metabolic fitness in these cells. Technical activities include: (1) Generate human CAR macrophages using non-viral electroporation, (2) Show proof-of-concept that human CAR macrophages can survive in a resource-poor environment, and (3) Show proof-of-concept that mouse CAR macrophages do not induce toxicity in vivo in mice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a synthetic lung surfactant product for the potential treatment of serious respiratory illnesses in neonatal patients.  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia affects 10,000-15,000 pre-term infants per year and has a high mortality rate. Exposure of immature lung tissue to air results in inflammation and damages lungs and airways. Decreasing  bronchopulmonary dysplasia is anticipated to reduce the number of days infants spend in the hospital, the need for supplemental oxygen, and other burdens on the healthcare system. The average length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is currently 103 days.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project may result in the formulation of synthetic proteins for a bioengineered lung surfactant that contains full-length critical phospholipids and anti-inflammatory agents. Currently, bioengineered pulmonary surfactants are not as effective as animal-derived pulmonary surfactants for the treatment of illnesses related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The synthesis of full-length, native surfactant proteins has yet to be achieved. This research seeks to synthesize proteins which may add significant viscoelasticity to the pulmonary surfactant. The protein will be combined with major surfactant phospholipids and anti-inflammatory therapeutics at defined ratios to potentially generate fully-synthetic pulmonary surfactant preparations with anti-inflammatory properties. These surfactant formulations will be screened in vitro and in vivo using a neonatal rat hyperoxia model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society?s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student?s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a sustainable fashion.  The proposed system can manage MSW without generating toxic air emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 98% compared to landfills and incineration. An additional benefit is that waste does not need to be separated, thereby promoting recycling of glass and metal, as they are left untreated.  In addition, the technology is envisioned to be  affordable and easily deployed to enable on-site treatment, saving transportation costs and associated impact. Finally, the system has the potential to use excess heat to generate electricity and use the by-product effectively. This system promotes a circular economy and supports multiple benefits to the environment.

    This project advances development of a novel system of applying gas plasma to create thermal degradation of MSW.  Phase I objectives are to research, design, construct, and test a prototype and define an industrial-scale design. Tasks include testing functionality and emissions quality with a variety of waste feedstock and operational parameters, and conducting a life cycle analysis. Furthermore, the project will explore the co-generation of electricity and beneficial reuse of the ash by-product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop low-cost, low-power, wireless sensor networks with long lifetimes for high density deployments in the field, primarily for precision agriculture. Existing solutions in the market consist of sensor modules with bulky batteries and repeaters driven by solar panels which drive up the cost.  These batteries and repeaters are infeasible for large-scale deployments. This project aims to provide sustainable solutions to increase the accuracy and efficiency of agricultural operations, while maximizing the crop yields and minimizing operational costs. The proposed sensor networks may also serve as a solution for military surveillance in the field, forest-fire prediction/mitigation, and smart highways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the use of wake-up receivers for radiofrequency (RF) communications, while also using the RF communications for moisture sensing. This use of wake-up receivers and RF-based sensing brings down the size and cost of the nodes and enables mesh networking. The research objectives of the project include both evaluation of such a network and the determination of the feasibility and reliability of wireless sensor nodes deployed inside the soil across varying soil conditions and permittivity variations. The outcome of the experiments will be a set of specifications for integrated circuits (ICs) and networks required for a dense network deployment in precision agriculture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry?s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to empower brain scientists with a high-resolution optical imaging instrument to reach currently inaccessible regions of the brain with minimal damage. The instrument contains thin fiber optics probes that enable access to very narrow cavities within the body or penetration of tissue. Deep brain imaging, photo-stimulation, and photo-ablation are possible applications, all of which could help understand brain function and potentially unlock treatments for brain diseases. The imaging instrument to be developed in this project may be amenable to scientific studies in animal models, addressing the need of neuroscientists and imaging facilities. The proposed technology could bring about innovations in biophotonics instrumentation as well as in the ensuing biomedical applications.  The project seeks to advance novel imaging technologies with broad applicability addressing a new segment in the endoscopy market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a critical need in scientific brain imaging studies for endoscopes that are minimally invasive with a diameter in the order of 100 microns, which represents a cross-area about 10 times smaller than the thinnest existing endoscopes. While current endoscopes are appropriate for insertion in large cavities, their size produces excessive damage in brain imaging applications. The objective is to develop a new class of fundamentally less invasive techniques to investigate novel imaging probes, and to validate a prototype instrument in animal models. It is anticipated that in-vivo imaging of neurons with subcellular resolution at depth will become routine with minimal tissue damage. This novel imaging approach implements wavefront shaping in multimode fibers, using advanced machine learning and signal processing methods, to generate arbitrary digitally-reprogrammable light patterns and 3D images. The ultrathin endomicroscope (UTE) uses a spatial light modulator to first calibrate the fiber and then scan light at high speed, compensating for the inherent modal dispersion and intermodal coupling.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to proactively identify and resolve mental health issues for children ages 10 - 18 before treatments and consequences become more acute and significantly more costly. This project innovation proposes bringing care to children at the onset of need using chatbot companions tailored deliberately and precisely to each child?s mental healthcare needs. Optionally, a child can be paired with live chat therapists and coaches no matter where the child is ? at home, school, or when on their own. The system leverages proven mobile device-accessed Cognitive Behavioral Therapies in tandem with machine learning (ML)-enabled technologies that learn from a variety of interactions with the child to detect and digitally triage their experiences of loneliness, anger, anxiety, and depression and to alert adults when intervention and treatment are deemed necessary. Without appropriate care, these symptoms frequently increase in severity over time and become more difficult to treat.  Intervening early can help slow or halt mental illness, reducing for parents, schools, and society the practical and financial burdens associated with reactive, generalized mental healthcare treatments while nurturing children into happier, healthier adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to build a system to determine the nature and severity of a child?s mental health needs through real-time, early detection. Research reveals children face more barriers than adults when obtaining mental healthcare, especially in rural, marginalized, and low-socioeconomic-status communities. Due to a severe shortage of child behavioral health practitioners across the country, children frequently wait up to a decade between the onset of mental health symptoms and treatment. This project seeks to eliminate the delay between when children first experience mental or emotional needs and when they receive appropriate care, ensuring they flourish?not flounder?during those crucial developmental years. Leveraging ML algorithms and proprietary question weighting, the project focuses on: 1) algorithm development to determine the most effective combination of chatbot and live chat counselor engagements to understand a child?s immediate issues and provide resolutions for the child and their parent(s); 2) improvements to ensure the responses are fit for purpose, recognizing and flagging appropriate conversations for human interaction; and 3) refining the frequency and content of notifications; such as, adaptive motivational messages and recommendations to counselors for tailoring interactions.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital imaging in dentistry.\
    \ The goal is to create an imaging device to assist dentists when they assess\
    \ gingival health. This project uses ultrasound in contrast to the X-rays typically\
    \ used in dental imaging. The project impact will be a decreased overall radiation\
    \ dose to both patients and oral health professionals as well as high-resolution\
    \ imaging details on the soft tissue (gums). Details on the gingiva is often difficult\
    \ or impossible to obtain with X-ray imaging. The impact of commercialization\
    \ will include improved patient satisfaction as well as faster and better treatment\
    \ outcomes. Oral health professionals will be able to treat more patients per\
    \ unit time. This ultrasound-based approach will also offer early detection of\
    \ periodontitis to reduce the high cost of treatment associated with advanced\
    \ periodontal disease. ?This device will reduce the risk of advanced periodontitis\

    \ gingiva where gum disease resides and leads to tooth loss. The first objective\
    \ of the project will use creative strategies to miniaturize the size of the imaging\
    \ equipment. This miniaturization is important in order to access all teeth in\
    \ the mouth?conventional ultrasound imaging equipment can only access the incisors\
    \ and canines. The second objective is the development of novel algorithms to\

    \ give clinicians detailed information about teeth and gums for diagnosis, prognosis,\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient?s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient?s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients? mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project?s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project?s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence/machinge learning (AI/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient?s future cognitive function.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to facilitate the blue economy?s continued transition to a big-data paradigm. Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation. The project enables adaptability by using an advanced control model methodology which adjusts the device hardware based on ambient environmental conditions for optimized performance. Due to the deployment environment, this project will capture training data under a laboratory setting, train the control model offline, and apply it in the field by leveraging edge computing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is potential commercial development of superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits with the ability to enable true biological brain-inspired deep neural network circuit algorithms and to improve efficiency, speed, and scalability of NC by orders of magnitude. The knowledge and approaches developed through this effort may help advance the foundational development of next generation computing hardware, helping NC continue its advance toward broad market adoption, and helping the US maintain its position as a leader in processor development and production. Additionally, the integrated synthesis-characterization-application approach can be extended to a range of applications, including sensors, metamaterials, catalysis, and renewables, which require atomic-scale control of materials and interfaces. Finally, through a partnership with University of Kansas, the project will facilitate university technology transfer and will serve to educate the next generation of materials and advanced electronics scientists and engineers. The atomic-to-nanoscale design, fabrication, characterization, and application experience will not only assist in recruiting top-quality students and provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits consisting of atomically tunable memristors (synapses) with superconductor interconnects and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs, neurons). This superconducting NC circuit aims to enable true biological brain-inspired deep network circuit algorithms and to achieve currently unattainable levels of energy efficiency, switching speed, and scalability in NC.  The proposed research will design, fabricate, and characterize superconducting memristor-SQUID NC circuit hardware including development of the corresponding algorithms for pattern recognition, with machine learning capabilities, using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database to prove viability. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is illustrated in: (1) novel, atomically-tunable memristors with 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic range in the on/off ratio and switching frequency that can enable spikes of different amplitudes and frequencies as demanded for emerging deep circuits, (2) SQUID neurons with very high sensitivity and low noise, and (3) neurons and interconnects that can significantly reduce power consumption by eliminating the parasitic wire resistance that, in current NC circuits, increases substantially with circuit scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions in order to make infrastructure and operational decisions. This decision-making capability is important as many facilities spend millions of dollars each year on improving sewer system function, yet are constrained by lack of quality data on sewer flows. Improved sewer flow data may help to optimize infrastructure improvements and reduce costs to taxpayers. In addition, this work may directly advance the health and welfare of the American public through improved wastewater collection systems operations and reduced overflows and basement backups. This technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to advance a novel, non-contact sensor that collects video of wastewater flow in sanitary sewer systems to measure flow rate and detect critical sewer events. Specifically, the technology collects video of sanitary sewer flows and processes it in real time using a machine learning algorithm to measure the velocity and water level of the flow. This technology also evaluates images of sewer flows to identify illicit discharges into the system. Several key technical hurdles crucial to successful commercialization of this innovation will be addressed in the proposed project, including the use of artificial illumination systems in closed pipe environments, the development of strategies to account for rapid variations in flow rates, and the development of data analytic methods to identify critical sewer events. Given these technical hurdles, the objectives of this project will be to develop a video-based flow sensor that can accurately capture velocity and water level under expected environmental conditions and to analyze data from the proposed sensor to accurately identify critical sewer events such as blockages and illicit discharges.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a visuospatial educational assessment tool.  Visuospatial aptitude is a facet of intelligence that underlies innovative thinking, i.e., how do new ideas emerge? and What are the physiological processes involved? Today, there is an overwhelming exposure within society to digital visual stimuli and national assessment authorities acknowledge visuospatial abstract reasoning as an accepted and sought after cognitive ability. Future curriculum designs must develop along with how people are changing and perceiving knowledge. This project seeks to set standards in education on visuospatial ability by introducing a novel assessment. This visuospatial assessment tool will utilize a software platform that allows customers to take the assessment online, and has commercial potential to improve industry, science, and educational programs for the advancement of human communication.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the development of an information technology consisting of a visuospatial ability assessment for measuring the biological processes that are required for being creative. Humans are biologically predisposed both to perceive and to reproduce symmetry, mainly in visual form, but also aurally; This proposed visuospatial assessment tool measures some of the biological processes that are required for the perception and reproduction of symmetry. Specifically, this assessment measures a form of sensorimotor perceptual action referred to in this project as ?affective symmetry gauging? (ASG). ASG consists of a subject?s innate visual perception/identification of the division in extreme and mean ratio point (DEMR; i.e., the symmetry point) in a given pattern. Because this process measures the extent to which a subject can perceive/identify and reproduce the symmetry point in given patterns, the tool also suggests the degree to which a subject may be inclined to reproduce symmetry, marking this inclination as a natural human expression of creativity aligned to pleasingness.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable one million Americans that suffer with the loss of ability to speak through disease of or damage to the larynx or mouth (aphonia). The inability to fluently communicate with other people has severe consequences. Voiceless individuals are three times more likely to suffer a preventable adverse event in medical settings than speaking patients, and this can lead to health problems and even life-threatening situations. Up to 50% of these adverse events could be avoided with adequate communication between patients and clinicians. The proposed solution is a video-to-speech software application that provides voiceless people with real-time communication assistance, especially geared towards medical settings. The technology could help prevent hundreds of thousands of adverse health events each year (costing $6.8 billion annually), with benefits for the voiceless population and the healthcare system in general. The innovation may improve voice restoration by providing real-time translation with no training needed and allowing complex messages to be expressed while looking eye-to-eye (an important part of human communication). Moreover, the technology does not require invasive installations nor complex equipment, is readily accessible, and has maintenance requirements that are marginal.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the intellectual challenge of overcoming the ambiguity of visemes when trying to automate lip-reading. Visemes (the gestures made when talking) and phonemes (the sounds produced with these gestures) do not share a one-to-one correspondence. This makes accurately predicting the intended speech based on visual information challenging. Previous researchers have failed to reach acceptable accuracy levels in the interpretation of visemes, while other tools only work with a few dozen words that must be structured according to pre-defined, fixed rules that are impractical. The main goal of this effort is to develop a combination of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network transducers that is capable of accurately differentiating visemes and permits real-time, reliable voice assistance for voiceless people. Project objectives include: (1) pre-training an algorithm to detect phonemes using publicly available speech video, (2) optimizing the phoneme-trained algorithm against healthcare relevant vocabulary, and (3) alpha-testing of the lip-reading algorithm against real-time speech.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic. Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep, insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10 Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an innovation in sleep therapy.  Approximately half of all American adolescents and young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression, and suicide.  The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively advance teenagers? circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities. This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better sleep hygiene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its ability to use machine learning and wearable technology to reduce uncontrolled destructive episodees, known as meltdowns, in children with autism. Meltdowns are highly distressing events for these children and their families and may require intervention on behalf of emergency response personnel and healthcare providers. Treating individuals with autism by proactively detecting meltdowns will allow caregivers time to intervene, mitigate, and prevent the onset of destructive behavioral episodes. The ability to predict a meltdown, and then implement strategic intervention to prevent the meltdown, may have positive life-changing effects for the children, their families, and their caretakes by reducing social stigma, enabling more mainstreaming of school and family activities, and reducing significant financial healthcare burdens. This technology may also be used to mitigate panic attacks in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a wearable device that detects, predicts, and helps prevent meltdowns in children with autism. Wearable devices that measure physiological parameters are available in the market, but none of them are specific to autism, and none of them proactively predict behavior episodes. A unique feature of this wearable device is that it uses machine learning to predict meltdowns. Incorporating machine learning allows each device to learn the unique biometric signature of the wearer so it can predict meltdowns with high accuracy. When a child is at high risk for a meltdown, the device will detect the relevant physiology and alert caregivers and therapists in time to intervene. The objectives of this project are to create a prototype which includes the wearable product and the individualization enabled by machine learning to correlate a child?s biometric measures with behavioral states. The goal is to achieve decreased frequency and/or severity of meltdowns. By enabling caregivers of children with autism to take control of and prevent meltdowns, this project has the potential to eliminate the stigma these children face during a meltdown in public, and empowers the children to become more independent as they age.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help hospitals improve their sterile processing departments (SPD), where decontamination, sterilization, and assembly of medical equipment and devices occur. The company?s proposed solution seeks to enhance SPD technicians? work performance and skill levels, decrease SPDs? operating costs, reduce Hospital Associated Infections (HAI) and Surgical Site Infections (SSI), lessen expensive surgical delays, and reduce related healthcare service delivery costs. Sterile processing technicians play a critical role in preventing infection by sterilizing, cleaning, processing, assembling, storing, and distributing medical supplies. They are directly responsible for disinfection and sterilization of hospital instruments/devices. The team uses mixed reality designed to augment the day-to-day work responsibilities of SPD technicians while supporting the cost-effectiveness of operating a SPD. The solution?s digital content and holograms provide an immersive experience increasing competency, maximizing workflow, and boosting productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project incorporates three applications into augmented reality hardware to enhance the job performance of sterile processing department (SPD) technicians. The applications include barcode/radio frequency identification (RFID) reading, traceability and surgical instrument detection, and inspection utilizing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).  These applications are designed to provide efficient and accurate tracking, improved workflow, and increased worker productivity. The research goals of the project include creating a software application programming interface (API) capable of reading barcodes and RFID tags. By providing additional monitoring and tracking capabilities with automated data within the users' field of view and creating an application to enhance object detection capabilities, SPDs in hospitals, doctors' offices and at-home care locations can learn, in real time, the best practices for sterilization of infected surfaces to enable safer and healthier living and work spaces.

In addition to improving the nation?s scientific and technical workforce pipeline, the project seeks to employ a unique commercialization model for interactive educational media that allows for both authentic learning and widespread use by general audiences. This model mixes digital and in-person experiences, digital distribution methods, and mobile experience commercialization strategies that can serve as a model for other educational and commercial interactive media companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two critical issues: engaging more youth in environmental science and engineering education and increasing local environmental data for scientists. The project team will research and develop optimal methods and tools for creating educational and interactive media with rapid scientific data collection capabilities. For youth and educators, the project seeks to engage users in national standards-aligned scientific learning activities. The project will create hyperlocal networks that collect data and make results directly available to local communities so that they can actively track pressing environmental concerns such as migrations and changes in populations of species. The technical goals of the project include creating new processes for connecting local, crowdsourced user input to citizen science data repositories in a way that automates the categorization and validation of that data. The resulting project will actively engage youth in real scientific research and improve data collection for federal and university environmental science programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides virtual interfaces that can be dynamically customized to address the challenge of user adoption in augmented reality (AR) products. This project overcomes previous limitations for AR such as the lack of interoperability, user-acceptance, scalability, and application-aware user intent recognition. While the AR market is projected to grow, wearable collaboration has unexplored potential. Users empowered by this project may be able to easily collaborate alongside skilled experts as well as robotic interfaces in the same medium. Through contextually-aware dynamic controls, manufacturing businesses can lower the risk of human-error while increasing fulfillment capabilities, as employees working from home can stay physically connected and remain engaged with minimal compromise. The AR innovation proposed in this project has application across multiple industries, including manufacturing, training, and emergency simulations.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create a framework for scalable experimentation of virtual interfaces that empower users to search, tag, and store meaningful data using gesture interactions in a secure and private manner. This project seeks to provide context-based, hands-free interaction with wireless devices while minimizing the need to set up sensors (such as optical components or microphones) in controlled environments and providing visual feedback and accessibility to the end user. A wrist-worn wearable captures pre-trained gesture data, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses identifies and analyzes an object within the context of said gestures to control a mechatronic device, such as a robot, to perform occupational tasks. This dynamic process uses factors such as the user?s gaze area, physical location, and computer application.  The improvement upon gesture control may allow a separate visual unit, such as the AR glasses, to wirelessly receive and display the gesture intents and perform contextually-aware, meaningful interactions with a clear distinction across a plurality of devices or digitally tagged objects associated with a specific use-case.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is not limited to the higher education community, but has broader application at the elementary, middle and high school levels, especially in underserved and marginalized communities experiencing increased rates of suicide and mental health issues. This project's innovative technologies can assist in the mental health crisis in the country's youth, and specifically in the Native American health system as well as Juvenile Detainee/Juvenile Justice systems. This project's implementation of research based on the benefits of game-based intervention coupled with biometric sensing has the potential to provide the technologies necessary to equip the mental health profession to develop options that could replace pharmacological interventions with a path to delivering personalized and measurement-based mental health services.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses predictive algorithms, wearable technology and peripheral autonomic biofeedback to provide timely and effective data to enable mental health professionals to enact treatments and therapeutic support for students. Challenges in the increase of adult mental illness, shortage of mental health professionals and shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists require a move towards tele-psychiatry, collaborative care and innovative technology to bridge the gap between inadequate supply and increasing demand. The proposed approach involves the development of bio-behavioral technology that provides mental health professionals an interactive stress and anxiety evaluation to enable deep, transformative connections between young adults and mental health service providers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a technology that delivers low cost of energy from offshore wind and unlocks new markets inaccessible to current technology, e.g., small populations with smaller, locally-maintained turbines, deep water locations where conventional floaters are not economical, and regions lacking deep ports. If successful, the global impact may have the potential to suppress carbon emissions at the scale of gigaton carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent/year. The proposed technology is a floating wind turbine that may reduce 80% of the weight of a conventional floating turbine and makes it possible to fabricate more components locally, with domestic businesses and jobs. The newly proposed architecture will be tested to ensure it survives and operates well in the ocean environment. The crucial first step is to adapt the National Renewable Energy Laboratory?s (NREL) world-class wind-wave software to simulate the unusual motions of the system and demonstrate its viability. The end goal is the commercialization of a disruptive offshore wind turbine, developed in the U.S. and deployed globally, that can outcompete all of today?s designs, in a market estimated to soon reach ~$100 billion/year.

    This project seeks provide the intellectual foundation that leads to a first-of-its-kind class of offshore wind turbines that have minimal weight, that rides on top of the waves, taht expands deployability into regions inaccessible with current technology, and that increases mobility for installation / maintenance. Such a floating structure has never before been designed and this project may provide deep insight into several questions about the loading and motions that arise from a complex superposition of turbulent wind, random waves, ocean current, rotor elasticity and angular momentum, and dynamic blade pitch and generator control. This STTR proposal seeks to address a critical technical risk: adaptation of NREL?s simulator OpenFAST to characterize the unique motions of the system operating in a complex environment of loading from wave, wind and current and the resulting impacts on loading and power production. The proposed system departs from long-standing industry conventions that have relied on the design principle of limiting system motions. The results of the simulator may be used to refine the system design and then demonstrate that it's dynamic behavior complies with the design load cases required for certification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the affordable and energy-efficient design of advanced powered lift aircraft, creating aircraft capable of transporting people and things to new locations. The reduction in transport cost and emissions made possible by this project may ensure that the advanced air mobility market, expected to grow to $120 Billion by 2030, develops community-compatible, economically- and socially-relevant mobility capabilities. The fundamental aerodynamic technology developed by this project may be applicable to a wide range of aircraft sizes and missions, enabling new capability in defense, public safety, and humanitarian roles as well as improving the quality of life for the public by enabling affordable, advanced mobility and logistics in urban, suburban, and underserved rural areas. The increased efficiency of the technology may enable these benefits to be realized while reducing the environmental impacts.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to confirm the feasibility of a new method of distributed electric propulsion for lift augmentation that combines high lift for low-speed performance with low drag, cruise-efficient wing design using a novel integrated propulsor. The project will explore the  complex and incompletely understood aerodynamic interaction of a propeller and wing, which is key to technical and commercial success. The technical objectives include: characterizing the slipstream influence on the wing pressure distribution and boundary layer characteristics, the influence of variations in propeller and wing configuration and location on high lift performance, and the aircraft level effects and tradeoffs of the configuration. The project seeks to meet these technical objectives with a combination of experimental wind tunnel research and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and analyses to thoroughly understand and characterize the complex flow physics and their impacts on aircraft performance and design. The effort may advance the propeller-wing interaction aerodynamics field.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the all-around strength of three dimentional (3D)-printed polymer objects, which will make such objects more useful for structurally-stressed prototypes and manufactured products (including prototypes and products that are physically large).  The prposed strength gains are expected from embedding continuous carbon-fiber filaments in multiple directions within the body of a 3D-print. Designers and engineers seek to tailor internal carbon-fiber arrangements to suit their specific needs. The resulting carbon-fiber-reinforced objects (as with 3D-printed objects in general) may be produced without the expensive and/or time-consuming use of molds, tooling, or specialized hand-labor.  By facilitating the cost-effective production of strong, plastics-based custom and low-volume manufactured products, this project seeks accelerate product development, foster entrepreneurship, and encourage manufacturing endeavors within the United States by making it easier to turn imagined concepts into strong, functional objects in the physical world.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a process for embedding continuous, layer-crossing, carbon-fiber filaments within the body of a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D print in order to provide tensile and shear reinforcement along planes orthogonal to the 3D printed layer. The goal of the research is to employ quasi-parallel filaments oriented orthogonal to 3D print layers, reducing the interlayer weakness and resultant structural anisotropy characteristic of FDM prints.  The project will further examine the use of more complex filament arrangements to provide selective reinforcement in directions and along paths specified by a product designer.  The overall strength, stiffness, and toughness will be assessed adn compared to conventionally-manufactured engineering plastics.  The embedding process, which will take place simultaneously with the layer-by-layer creation of the print, will be achieved by combining the actions of FDM printer nozzles with those of automated robotic filament manipulators.  The project will examine the geometric range of printed parts and components that incorporate reinforcing filaments, with initial goal of printing reinforced shell-like objects that continuously curve along multiple axes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.

    The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber ? designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.

    The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used in a variety of settings, including doctors? offices, physical therapy offices, and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of $1.7 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, ?green?, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the productivity and safety of operations across the entire $1.3 trillion Blue Economy. Maritime operations routinely involve significant risks to human life and property and consequently bear extraordinarily high operating costs. Autonomous ocean vehicles (falling under the Robotics technology area) are being rapidly adopted by science, commercial, and defense organizations due to their potential to dramatically reduce cost and risk. The success of the proposed project will advance the state of the art for commercial autonomous vehicle compliance with international laws regulating interactions between maritime vessels at sea. Giving autonomous ocean vehicles the ability to interact with crewed vessels safely and predictably will accelerate the adoption of these tools and the missions they enable. Several specific market segments stand to benefit immediately from the proposed technology, including the $31B offshore wind market, the $2B port automation market, the $233B aquaculture market, and dozens of others. Beyond market impacts, humanity needs ocean data to understand the critical dangers of overfishing and climate change.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the design of systems and software needed for autonomous ocean vehicles to comply with the international collision regulations (COLREGS) for maritime vehicles. The difficulty the industry has faced in creating COLREGS compliant autonomy is the fact that the rules were developed with the expectation that experienced mariners would be able to make qualitative interpretations in unique situations. That led to a descriptive rather than prescriptive set of rules that is good for human mariners, but difficult to implement in software. The objectives of this Phase I project include the design and simulation of autonomous systems able to operate in compliance with the COLREGS. In addition to simulations, the software may be deployed to small autonomous surface vehicles for preliminary on-water testing. Anticipated results include a system able to maintain COLREGS compliance within a documented envelope of conditions. The effective implementation of safe system design, optimized control, and machine learning techniques can combine to produce the first autonomous ocean vehicles that can be trusted in congested waterway settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to produce a high performance, low power, electronic chemical sensor system that does not require a radioactive ionization source. Achieving a low cost, non-radioactive Internet of Things (IoT) systems for chemical sensing in a more distributed and connected network has potentially far reaching implications in many industries. Creating an IoT network of sensors to safely monitor chemical signatures on a large and distributed scale, in real-time, may provide new analytical-quality chemical sensing capabilities. Sensor applications may range from engineering (monitoring fermentations) and to health care (diagnostics), to environmental monitoring (air quality) and defense and security (hazard detection) or agriculture (waste mitigation). The chemical sampling and sensor platform has the potential to be integrated with cell phones and autonomous systems. The market for personal use devices could be substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to establish an experimental and theoretical framework to optimize Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) for analytical quality chemical identification. There are many types of chemical sensors that have been commercialized but no high-quality systems meet the performance, safety, and cost constraints required to be a successfully linked in an IoT system. The fundamental physics and commercial utility of DMS is well established, so it is a leading candidate for this use. The foundation of the system is a miniaturized DMS. Because the microchip operates on lithium ion polymer batteries, it has the potential for widely dispersed IoT-linked chemical sensing but the reliance on radioactive isotopes for chemical ionization is a critical barrier to adoption that limits commercial applications. This technical barrier may be overcome by combining a non-radioactive, plasma-based method of chemical ionization. The experimental results will be used to validate custom software to simulate performance of this complex system. If the performance of the combined system can be successfully modeled, it can be further miniaturized and optimized. The detection of natural gas odorants and selected food and flavor compounds have been selected as initial proof-of-concept commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to facilitate ocean data collection. Understanding the oceans is important for climate research, naval operations, maritime domain awareness, and ecosystem preservation, yet traditional data collection methods using research ships, commercial vessels, and buoys are cumbersome, expensive, and  limited in their scope of discovery. While satellites have enabled remote data collection, they are affected by weather and limited in the types of data they collect. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) - robotic boats - are promising, but even today?s smallest oceangoing USVs are too costly for many applications. Thus, many regions of Earth?s oceans are rarely studied. The technology developed here aims to meet this need by enabling low-cost deployment of sensor-equipped robotic fleets. Better access to ocean data may improve understanding of the ocean and its resources, leading to better climate modeling, improved safety, economic gains, and more effective regulations. Further, ocean monitoring and surveillance is key to understanding ocean water quality, identifying contaminants, and devising strategies to prevent future contamination and pollution of the ocean?s waters. Ultimately, cost-effective oceanic data collection may help sustain and grow the ocean economy.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a small, low-cost, autonomous robotic sailboat that uses an innovative sail arrangement and weather-optimized navigation system. With a combination of affordability and utility, the technology represents a new approach for widespread oceanic data collection. This technology can be deployed virtually anywhere in the ocean, can be small (2 meters or less), and is 100% wind- and solar-powered. The research in this project seeks to further this technology by advancing two innovations: passive directional stability and weather-optimized navigation. Unlike most other robotic sailboats, the proposed USV does not need active steering to hold a course, once set. Further, the proposed USV has a navigation system that exploits the spatial and temporal variance in the weather and uses local weather data to direct the boats to navigate more efficiently. This STTR proposal seeks to address areas of high technical risk including stability of the steering system under various wind and water conditions, resistance to traveling excessively downwind during storms, effectiveness of the optimized navigation system in both actual and simulated weather conditions at locations worldwide, construction and performance of prototypes in lakes and oceans, and long-term resistance to marine environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.  Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks to  disrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop the first universal method for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of all main bodily fluids in biological stains revealed at a crime, overcoming the limitations of standard biochemical tests when identifying biological stains. The proposed technology will allow for rapid, accurate and nondestructive identification of, and distinction between, biological stains that supports the possibility of linking DNA to a bodily fluid type, thus increasing the efficiency of crime labs and assisting law enforcement personnel in the identification of suspected criminals. Commercially, this technology will be of use to the 600+ Crime Investigation Labs and 19,000+ crime scene investigators within the U.S. Department of Justice. The new approach has the potential to reduce the backlog of unprocessed DNA samples in crime labs across the U.S., while providing data that can improve the efficiency of evidence analyses.

    This analysis platform has the potential to significantly advance the field of crime scene analysis by replacing single body fluid-specific chemical tests, that are inaccurate and destructive in nature, with software that offers the novel ability to positively identify all bodily fluids in order to generate real-time decisions regarding sample content and further analyses.  The project will establish proof-of-principle through the optimization of a Raman spectroscopy method for a desktop instrument while further developing software for realistic body fluid sampling. This will allow for the development of a working prototype for crime laboratory usage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project is the creation of a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost, semi-automatic. ultra-high-altitude balloon system for suborbital transportation system. The technology seeks to provide routine sub-orbital atmospheric flights for environmental testing of payloads in the ultra-low vacuum of the Mesosphere (260,000 feet).  The technology also seeks to transport metrological payloads, such as radiosondes (that measures pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) and rawinsondes (that evaluate wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) at all altitudes from the ground to 260,000 feet for extended periods of time. This capability is especially critical for increasing the success rate of space missions. The new testing capability may save the space industry hundreds of million dollars in technology failures annually. The transportation of metrological payloads to the upper extremes of the atmosphere for extended periods of time may also provide improved accuracy of weather forecasts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to solve well-known problems that prevent balloons from taking payloads to the upper atmosphere. This project will develop hardware prototypes, perform software development, and integrate the hardware and software together.  The team will perform flight demonstrations to characterize the impact of the Mesospheric environment on the ballooning flight transport and demonstrate the low-cost payload transport to the Mesospheric sub-orbital altitudes for a long duration (> hour).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate the adoption of error correction technologies in the quantum computing industry.  It is widely held that quantum error correction will be critical to realize the potential of universal quantum computing.  An error-corrected quantum computer holds promise for making transformational discoveries in science and engineering that will have broad impact across traditional technology sectors. By developing resource-efficient quantum error correction design and decoding software tools, this Phase I project aims to hasten the era of error-corrected quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new method for error syndrome extraction from a register of data qubits during the execution of an error-corrected quantum algorithm. In contrast to the standard approach to syndrome extraction, where each quantum codeword is treated independently, this new approach extracts error information from the entire quantum computer collectively.  The algorithmic and cost advantage of the proposed approach is a reduction in the number of extra qubits required for error syndrome extraction. This project will focus on reducing the density of the quantum circuits used for syndrome extraction according to the new approach. Low-density quantum circuits are critical for robust quantum error correction since syndrome extraction is mediated by two-qubit entangling gates, which often have error rates higher than idling or memory errors occurring in the data qubits. Another objective of this Phase I project is to design low-density error correcting codes that promote locality in syndrome extraction. Local syndrome extraction is important for error correction in quantum processors that support limited connectivity between qubits. A final objective is to benchmark the proposed constructions and algorithms on simulated data and perform proof-of-concept experimental validation on cloud-based quantum computers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, which affects about one in eight men and is the second deadliest cancer among men. The current process for diagnosing prostate cancer is imprecise and commonly involves multiple rounds of increasingly invasive, uncomfortable, and expensive diagnostic tests. The medical technology proposed in this project will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging tests (MRIs) performed to confirm diagnosis, and enable improved ongoing monitoring of suspected or recovered prostate cancer patients. The proposed device will help hospitals save valuable time and decrease overall costs of care. The device will be designed to address the specific needs of clinicians to accurately diagnose prostate cancer cases at an earlier point in the diagnostic workflow, at a lower cost to health systems. Additionally, the technology will be developed with a focus on cost effectiveness, to ensure increased prostate cancer diagnostic capabilities are accessible even in low-resource settings, such as rural communities and low- and middle-income countries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a prototype of a new medical device that uses photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and novel acoustic lens technology to aid in detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Existing early testing options, such as digital rectal exams, prostate-specific antigen tests, and transrectal ultrasounds, are often inconclusive. The PAI endoscopic probe device proposed in this project will offer hospitals and clinicians a new method for visualizing potentially cancerous prostate tissues, with higher imaging contrast and resolution than existing diagnostics. It will also offer an alternative to other testing methods with known deficiencies that often result in misdiagnosis or missed cases.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to arm emergency personnel with an objective\
    \ tool for identifying large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes while in route to\

    \ patients to the most appropriate care setting and reduce the time to intervention.\
    \ LVOs require endovascular therapy which only comprehensive stroke centers have\
    \ the capability to conduct. If a patient with an LVO is routed to a hospital\

    \ achieved under three hours and statistically significant improvements for each\
    \ 15-minute window under that threshold. Stroke is the second leading cause of\
    \ death and the primary cause of long-term disability worldwide costing the US\
    \ $65B every year. Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke in the US annually and\
    \ 40% are left with a permanent disability. The project will streamline stroke\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a biosensing technology that may enable highly sensitive, quantitative, point-of-care diagnostics. Once validated, the proposed biosensor, disposable sensor chips/cartridges, and electronic readout modules can be readily mass-produced using existing medical device manufacturing capacities. The technology may have an impact on the health and welfare of patients. The immediate goal is to examine interleukin protein monitoring for early detection of cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening health complication that develops in patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment, organ transplant, infectious disease, sepsis, etc. Additional applications include early detection of cancers or cancer recurrence, dry eye disease, existing and emerging infectious disease, biothreats, etc.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a proof-of-concept demonstration of a low-cost, magnetic biosensor technology that may enable analytical laboratory capabilities for reliable biomarker detection and quantitation at the point of care. The proposed biosensor will be adapted for quantitative detection of interleukin proteins in blood for early diagnostics of cytokine release syndrome. The technology integrates magnetic sensing into the ubiquitous lateral flow assay (LFA) format (used in pregnancy tests) utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as reporters of biomolecular interactions. The tests are well-suited for point-of-care applications where rapid and convenient access to low-cost diagnostic tools helps improve patient care. The rationale for this project is that the proposed biosensors can provide clinically-relevant quantitative data rivaling those of state-of-the-art laboratories while preserving the advantages of LFA tests in terms of low cost and ease of use. The disposable chip with its clam-shell design builds upon the usual LFA cassette design. The disposable chip will be produced and assembled from low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and is expected to add only cents to the cost of an LFA test. A low-cost portable reader capable of ultrahigh sensitivity quantitative readings will be built from conventional off-the-shelve electronic components.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project on a handheld simultaneous translator advances the state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning acceleration. Beyond technical contributions, the novel translator will likely have a significant impact on a wide range of domains, such as military personnel deployed in foreign countries, businesspeople participating in multilingual meetings, medical service providers, law enforcement, customer support services, diplomats and political representatives, local governmental entities providing services to citizens in the preferred language, and international tourists. As such, the project will have broader impacts in increasing economic competitiveness, advancing health and welfare, and improving military capabilities of the United State. Furthermore, the project helps to enhance equity in education and STEM literacy by enabling better access to educational resources to people of diverse backgrounds, especially immigrants, women, and underrepresented minorities in some countries/regions, who were previously disadvantaged due to limited prior educational access or limited access to foreign language courses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the research and development of innovative algorithmic optimizations and a purpose-built translation device to enable fast, accurate and low-power inference for simultaneous translation. The overall approach is to exploit the unspoken but implied connections among language elements at various levels to guide the learning model. Specific techniques are investigated at the phoneme-level, work-level, and sentence-level. Collectively, these innovations aim to reduce the computation complexity of simultaneous translation by orders of magnitude while increasing translation accuracy. A systematic and comprehensive methodology is also being established that allows fast implementation of the inference hardware via high-level synthesis and reports detailed statistics on translation accuracy, latency, power, and area to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the research.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide a significant improvement in economic incentives for water rights holders to conserve and efficiently deploy their water. One of the greatest struggles facing the Western States is the disincentive for water rights holders to efficiently manage their water. If holders don?t use the entirety of their water each year, they risk losing the unused portion back to the State. Commercially, despite a billion-dollar demand for seasonal leasing of water?which would satisfy annual use requirements?water holders have no place and little ability to market and lease their unused water. This approach using the proposed distributed ledger technology (DLT), allows holders to track and log their water rights information on its platform. In turn, water users will finally have access to information that traditionally informs other property transactions?title history, water usage, comparable transactions, and localized pricing. With that information, our customers populate a marketplace where short-term and long-term transactions can be quickly and easily transacted. In sum, by creating the tools and interfaces to digitize water rights and enable simple-to-execute water transactions, DLT will power water markets and drive efficient water use throughout the West.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and develop a unique combination of distributed ledger (DL) tokenization and a decentralized distributed file system (DDFS) to produce a robust digital twin of both physical water rights and usage, as well as the associated legal materials and data. DL tokens represent the legal quantity of water that has been granted to the user by the government. DDFS allows the storage of key information pertaining to the water rights?including title and use history?in a public, immutable manner, anchored in the DL transactions. This approach provides a level of trust, transparency and provenance for water that is currently absent in the United States. The current state of the market?makes it impossible for the average water owner and manager to have any insight into the value of their water assets. Water-specific marketplaces backed by DL and DDFS allow both buyers and sellers the ability to view, vet, and transact water assets efficiently and with minimal cost. This first phase of research and development will establish the requisite infrastructure to populate those marketplaces.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to promote increased recycling and to enable the upcycling of two of the most common polymers found in mixed waste streams: polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). While plastic recycling can assist in mitigating the vast and continuously growing volume of plastic waste, mixed plastic streams?notably those with PE and iPP?introduce many challenges.  These polymers are immiscible but of similar density, making them unsuitable for simple melt-blending yet difficult to separate. Although additives have been developed to overcome the immiscibility issue, these additives typically need to be added at high loadings and produce resins with poor mechanical properties. This project focuses on the development of advanced additives (compatibilizers) that can be introduced in low concentrations to produce PE/iPP resins with superior durability, ductility, and industrial utility that rivals or outperforms homopolymers. Such a technology has the potential to bring superior efficiency to the mixed recycling process, advancing the field toward a more circular plastics economy. By delivering high-value products from waste streams, widespread adoption of this technology would drive improvements in plastic waste collection, recycling, and re-manufacturing, supporting jobs in these and adjacent fields.

    This project involves the creation of non-reactive, multi-graft copolymers capable of supporting high-quality iPP/PE blends with superior tensile strength characteristics, impact resistance, and rigidity compared to current resins. The proposed approach leverages interlocked molecular entanglements and co-crystallization to provide stronger adhesion to iPP and PE. This technology seeks capability of up to 30% iPP contamination in PE using as little as 1 wt% additive to generate high-value blended materials. Phase I development will involve: 1) optimization of polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymer compatibilization additives, 2) scale-up of optimized polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymers, 3) testing of larger scale batches for end polymer qualities, and 4) testing of compatibilizers with combinations of different grades of actual post-consumer plastic waste. The technology may contribute to an enhanced understanding of how specific copolymer architectures influence compatibilization efficiency, while also meeting the need for technologies to support compatibilization of PE and iPP for blended recycling applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is based on the improvement of respiratory equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE). Commercially available face masks, gowns, filter media and other PPE are contaminated through environmental exposure, posing a threat to healthcare personnel.  The proposed solution is a high-surface-area antiviral/antimicrobial micropowder which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Improved protection from infections and reduced cross-contamination may result in fewer deaths, decreased healthcare costs, and increased economic productivity. The addressable global PPE market was $23 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow through 2028, while the global disposable face mask market was valued at $792 million in 2019, and the inclusion of other types of PPE increases this estimate further. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving the demand for these products, though the applicability of the proposed technology is not limited to COVID-19. The proposed product will be material that can modify the surfaces of fabrics with active antiviral properties, leading to improvements in health and safety. The customer base is expected to be healthcare personnel, pharmaceutical and food manufacturing facilities, the public, and manufacturers of PPE, medical devices, textiles, and filters.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to improve the antiviral/antimicrobial properties of respiratory equipment and PPE, which is typically only passively protective, is difficult to decontaminate and re-use, and can lead to worker exposure during changing and handling. The proposed solution is a high-surface-area micropowder, coated with an antiviral/antimicrobial coating, which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Unlike current technologies, the particle size, morphology, surface area, and topography can all be tailored for specific biocidal activity. Additionally, powder shape and surface quality can be customized to enhance adhesion. The proposed project is to develop a prototype powder product formulation that allows easy application of antiviral (copper alloy) coated particles to fabrics and other materials. This technology is based on a fluidized-bed, plasma-enhanced deposition process for synthesizing unique core-shell micropowders of metal, ceramic, or highly-shaped nanoforms of carbon, including proven biocidal materials. The synthesized microparticles will have high surface-to-weight ratios making them better suited for capturing micro-organisms while also having improved bonding to surfaces of filter media and PPE materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the foundation of a fractional-calculus-based computational platform for the simulation of multiscale and multiphysics systems. This Phase I effort will focus on developing modeling capabilities for nonlinear thermomechanical fatigue and damage behavior of ductile materials and will provide important insights on both feasibility and performance of the fractional calculus approach for a class of nonlinear problems that is not only of extreme importance for scientific and industrial applications but it is also a prototypical example of multiscale and multiphysics systems.
    By leveraging an advanced and generalized class of operators, namely the distributed and variable-order fractional operators, this project will develop fatigue and damage mechanics simulation software capable of continuum scale computational efficiency and microscale accuracy. The resulting formulation will offer an unprecedented combination of computational efficiency, a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, and a revolutionary adaptive mathematical structure that evolves in real-time based on the underlying physics controlling the deterioration and damage process.

    The overarching innovation at the basis of the M3SIM software products is a one-of-its-kind computational platform based on cutting-edge distributed-variable order (DVO) fractional calculus (FC). The unique nature of DVO operators allows the new platform to perform multiscale and multiphysics analyses of complex systems at a level of accuracy and efficiency that is unattainable with traditional methods. This new approach will have profound practical implications for predictive science because it will enable a novel concept of an adaptive computational platform whose structure evolves with the underlying physics without a priori and ad hoc decisions from the user.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the company?s novel fire detection principle and the use of soft computing techniques by means of (1) computational experiments, and (2) a wide range of real fire and nuisance experiments on the company?s fire detector prototypes. This will allow the company to resolve any technical hurdles that may arise from the integration of the software and hardware into a minimum viable fire detector expected to significantly outperform current market solutions. The company has utilized real-world datasets of fire and nuisance experiments conducted by NIST to test and benchmark the innovation. Using temperature data, for example, the company?s algorithm detected fires up to 10 times faster than current technology (fixed-threshold). In addition, no missed detection occurred, and no false alarms were triggered in all NIST experiments. While these results are impressive, they are not sufficient to commercialize the innovation given that they are based on 69 experiments only. The activities proposed in phase I are designed to reduce the technical risk and strengthen the confidence in the company?s technology prior to commercialization. This is especially important because of the high regulatory burden and associated liabilities in the fire detection space.

    By leveraging ML, erli.ai?s patent-pending technology will process streaming data from heat/smoke sensors to detect the earliest signs of fire and separate fire and nuisance events. We introduce a new alarm triggering principle rooted in the temporal analysis of sensor data instead of the existing fixed-threshold approach. We propose to further develop our computational architecture, which employs deep Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and a variational autoencoder, by developing a theoretical basis for the outstanding performance our algorithm produced. We will develop an anomaly detection evaluation scheme for time streaming clustering using Dynamic Time Warping and Similarity Matrix technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major fundamental knowledge gaps underpinning the ability to create accurate flood maps. This proposal will advance new knowledge on the use of advanced analytics for the estimation of floods, thus transforming the tools available to respond and plan for flooding. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that building-scale flood detection will be achieved through a combination of existing sensors and advanced analytics. This SBIR project will research and develop data-driven flood maps to support targeted flood response and long-term infrastructure planning. Using advanced analytics, existing sensor data will be spatially distributed to create real-time flood maps. The method will be validated using a highly dense sensor network in the Great Lakes region. The technical results of this project will yield unprecedented insights and measurements of uncertainty related to flood estimation at urban scales. The resulting real-time flood maps will allow stormwater managers to stay ahead of resident complaints, while saving lives and property by sending their crews to the most important locations. Improved flood maps will also allow stormwater managers to maximize the impact of long-term infrastructure investments.

    The project's goal is to make all communities resilient to floods and climate change. To that end, this proposal will show how advanced analytics, driven by wireless sensing, will transform the ability of first responders to save lives, while helping stormwater managers maximize long-term infrastructure investments. The key innovation of this proposal is a data methodology, which will convert raw, spatially distributed sensor data into actionable, real-time flood maps. This data-driven technique will enable the first of its kind tool to detect floods at the scale of individual buildings, without requiring a sensor at every location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) ?always-on? toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power ?always-on? IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be transformational to multiple markets that require energy storage. High-energy densities will be enabled by the proposed advanced polymer separators. Potential customers for the new battery separator include battery manufacturers for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, space and military, small wearable devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), drones, consumer electronics, as well as automotive manufacturers in the mass mobility market. Adoption will be driven by the huge demand for electric vehicle batteries that are cheaper, lighter, safer and allow for longer drive ranges and reduced charge time. There are multiple ways in which consumers and society will benefit from the batteries enabled by this novel solid-state separator; from electric cars, to flying taxis; from more efficient energy storage grids to more reliable space vehicles; from lighter wearable devices to long lasting medical implants. In the long-term, the successful development of low-cost, fast-charging, high-density, long-life, and safe batteries enabled by the company?s new separator will reduce fossil fuel dependency and drive the electrification of the transportation sector and the transition towards greener energy solutions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an advanced polymer separator for novel hybrid solid/liquid battery cells which will dramatically improve performance of state-of-the-art solid-state batteries, enabling higher energy density, faster charging rate and enhanced safety over commercial Lithium-ion batteries. The new separator will be constructed from a novel polymer material whose feasibility has been validated at laboratory level. Stability tests showed higher conductivity and stability than currently available options. Compatibility with high-voltage cathodes was also demonstrated in preliminary studies. The goals of the project are (1) to develop a solid electrolyte which has an ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes that are currently used in the Li-ion batteries and (2) a scalable solid separator (using the above electrolyte) that is compatible with high-voltage cathodes (4 ? 6 V). Main technical hurdles to overcome for successful commercialization are developing blade-cast-worthy slurries and scaling up the separator to a cell-size free-standing sheet. The former will be achieved by tuning the composition of the slurry to improve solubility; the latter will be achieved by improving the molecular weight of the polymer and blending and mixing it with ceramic oxide.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to make the gathering of tree measurements and other field-based nature observations dramatically easier. The project involves building a mobile app that uses computer vision and augmented reality to make measuring trees much easier than using the tape measures of today, in fact it will be as simple as scanning a barcode. This will result in much more nature imagery and other training data for use with ecological models, which will yield a better understanding of how ecosystems will change in the coming years. One important prediction this project will help with is forest growth which is very useful for generating carbon offsets that can finance the regeneration of large amounts of land. Better ecological models can also help communities prepare for changes in climate, sea level, soil quality and other ecological shifts in the coming decades. Millions of people will be potentially affected by climate change and its accompanying shifts in ecosystems, so arming communities and governments with better insights about these impacts will be critical. Furthermore, catalyzing many millions of hectares of nature regeneration projects will help mitigate the worst effects of climate change and other ecological challenges.


    This project involves the unique combination of computer vision with augmented reality in order to quickly and accurately measure trees. There are multiple computer vision neural networks being developed for the app. One of them uses bark and tree imagery in order to classify the tree species, an important feature needed for ecological models. Another model analyzes surrounding scenery and quickly identifies the closest tree trunk. The app then uses the phone?s augmented reality capabilities to gauge the distance and orientation of the phone from the trunk and combines these two to yield a diameter at breast height measurement. The research plan involves collecting data from specific regions in Panama and Brazil in conjunction with active nature restoration projects and gathering a critical mass of leaf and bark imagery so that species in those areas can be classified accurately. The scope will then increase to additional regions and later, measurements such as birdsong and other biodiversity markers. Over time the app could become a platform for many such nature observations, and it is expected to evolve to become more game-like to attract large numbers of people having fun experiences together and advancing the cause of nature science.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a novel method of drying agricultural products that is more energy efficient than current commercial devices and preserves the nutritional value of the dried products. This project is based upon  fast dehydration of wet biomass using desiccants comprised of particles of a certain size and arrangement. According to preliminary trials, this method may be 10 times more energy efficient than other drying methods. This project will produce a reusable particle filter that can be used to efficiently dehydrate food and agricultural products. This drying method can preserve nutritional value within the US food system while simultaneously reducing production costs, make agricultural industries more economically viable, and be easily powered by renewable energy sources thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption within the food industry.

    The technical innovation of this STTR Phase I project is the development of efficient and effective drying methods for agricultural products.  The technology is based on the incorporation of zeolite particles onto a substrate while maintaining their porosity. In order to achieve rapid dehydration of wet matter, the zeolite must be small in size and supported on a substrate so that its surface retains functionality. This methodology requires careful chemical synthesis. The key research goals are to conjugate or physically bind zeolite particles to a porous substrate, maintain the accessible surface area of the zeolite, and create a new material that can endure many cycles of brief low-power microwave heating to accomplish dehydration. In this project, several approaches will be investigated, starting with the synthesis of porous substrates, then modifying the surface to contain a controlled number of chemical functional groups, and then coating the substrate with zeolite using covalent linkages. In addition to covalent monolayer linkages, the project will also aim to optimize substrate coverage using other binding mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding.

    \ safety and reliability, and to reduce operating costs, for gas turbine engines,\
    \ a technology that impacts the daily lives of Americans by providing electric\
    \ power and aircraft propulsion. Moreover, the national defense and energy industries\
    \ are particularly reliant upon this technology, making this project highly impactful\
    \ to these aspects of American welfare. Gas turbine engines contain nickel alloy\

    \ to ensure failure never occurs unexpectedly, as in-service failures inevitably\
    \ result in catastrophic engine damage.  The integrity of repairs is largely dependent\
    \ upon mechanical performance of filler alloys designed to patch cracks and cavities\
    \ in the engine blades, which this project aims to improve through novel metallurgical\
    \ design grounded in fundamental science.  The scientific community at large will\
    \ benefit from this research, as it will pioneer applied development for alloys\
    \ within an emerging material class only two decades in the making.  Designed\
    \ alloys will have a commercial advantage over existing repair products due to\
    \ superior performance and similar cost.  This advantage will form the core of\
    \ a successful business opportunity, which will generate revenue and provide STEM\
    \ jobs as the business expands.  \n\n \nWhen designing new alloys from the ground\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will provide the medical field with a broad response detector capable of pairing with cheaper disease diagnostic tools for improved healthcare.  Currently, there is not a commercially available broadband detector that can capture visible light and near infrared light.  The Phase I SBIR effort will lead to an advanced detector capable of spanning this light range and fulfilling this unmet need.  As a commercial product, this detector can be used in multiple commercial sectors including unmanned vehicles, the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.  For example, in the medical field the ideal light for tissue penetration is between visible and near infrared.  The detector developed in this project would permit optical scans of human bodies for disease diagnosis.  The optical scan will provide a cheaper and safer alternative in comparison to expensive MRI technology and high-energy sources, such as x-rays, that result in radiological exposure.  The size of the global medical imaging market is currently valued at $16 billion and the proposed work would help healthcare services in rural areas have access to optical diagnosing services.

    Semiconductor-based detectors are limited to absorbing photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the electronic band gap of the semiconductor.  As a result, there is not a commercially available detector that can span 400-2200nm with fast detection.  The expected outcome of this project is a single broadband detector, based off of the quantum spin Seebeck effect to generate a spin current, that can span 400-2200nm with a flat quantum efficiency and a high response time.  The quantum efficiency (QE) of the patent-protected detector is almost three orders of magnitude lower than semiconductor-based detectors and the largest portion of the project is devoted to improving the QE to commercial levels.  The project will accomplish the following goals: 1) prove the feasibility of increasing the quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, 2) make a readout circuit board, 3) show detector capabilities through building a benchtop-working prototype, and 4) design a compact prototype to be built during Phase II. As a commercial product, this detector can be used in unmanned vehicles, in the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF?s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.

    This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will help address the major concerns of climate change and sustainability of arable lands. The two common methods of weed control in the agricultural industry, herbicides and soil tillage, have a negative impact on the environment and soil sustainability. The health of the microbial environment in the soil is degraded by the use of herbicides and soil tillage. In addition, soil tillage exposes the organic matter in the soil to oxidation releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goal for reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate is to sequester the carbon in the soil and not release it. At this time, the only option for weed control of mid to late stage weeds without the use of herbicides or soil tillage is manual labor, which is more expensive. The successful development and testing of the precision weeder extraction tool will give the agricultural industry an automated and cost effective option for addressing weed control while helping to reduce the carbon emission from the soil and protect soil sustainability.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector extraction tool that can remove weeds without using chemicals or soil tillage. Advances in machine vision have made it possible to identify the individual plants in a field and determine which plant is the crop and which one is the weed. Presently, the two predominant methods used by automated weeders to kill the weeds is either by a targeted herbicide spray or soil tillage. Both of these methods negatively impact the environment and soil health. The proposed precision weeder will extract and dispose of the weeds without damage to the soil or environment. The economics of weeding will require the device to be simple, cost effective, reliable, and field hardened. Design and development of the extraction tool will use a new and novel method for removing the weeds with advances in design and actuation. The extraction tool will be tested in the field to determine its feasibility. Successful field trials will convince the customer and investor that this is a viable option for commercial automated weeding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is its innovative and potentially transformative contribution to assistive technologies for infants with motor impairment. In the United States, over 40,000 infants per year are born with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down syndrome, that often result in motor impairment. There is currently no device that provides independent movement to infants with motor limitations. Since children learn a great deal about their physical and social environments when they begin to crawl/walk, conditions that deny or delay independent movement can impact cognitive, language, and social development. A device that will let these infants move and explore at the same age as other children could mitigate these developmental delays and facilitate full integration into society.  Lifetime cost of healthcare for these children has been estimated at $250,000. Providing early independent movement could result in a potential $50,000 lifetime reduction in additional interventions such, as behavioral and occupational therapy, special education, and the need for healthcare and educational aides.  This amounts to over $200,000,000 in savings per year to the health and education systems.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need, expressed by parents and therapists, for a device that will allow infants with motor impairment to move independently at the same age as their typically developing peers. Currently, no such device is available.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is the development of a novel control method for a powered device that can be used by infants as young as 6 months old:  The device moves in the direction that the infant leans (as when reaching toward a toy or parent) while preventing collisions and falls.  Previous research has shown that infants as young as five months old can learn to use this control method to purposefully steer a powered device in all directions. The research objectives of this project are to build and validate a second-generation prototype that can be used by parents and clinicians outside of a research setting. Successful completion of these objectives will advance the device from a research testbed to a viable, if limited, prototype, enabling future work to evaluate the impact of the device on the development of cognitive, social, and communication skills for infants with disabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind?s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot?s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot?s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to introduce a cost-effective way of crop protection from fungal spoilage. Every year, 25% of the food produced by the world is wasted due to fungal infections and contamination of crops with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The combined social, environmental, and economic global annual cost of this food wastage is >$2T. The proposed innovation is centered on harnessing an untapped bacterium to bring a new line of affordable antifungals to a broad base of crop growers across the United States, which are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing preharvest postharvest treatment protocols. The products are quick and easy to manufacture without costly purification procedures. They should be safe for the environment and human health and have a defined mechanism of action. As a result, billions of dollars? worth of crops, energy, and resources could be saved, leading to increased agricultural sustainability and economic competitiveness of the United States. It may also advance the health and welfare of the American public by enhancing food safety. Finally, it can pave the way for other innovations to combat fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation by developing the first product, safeguarding corn crops from fungal spoilage during both preharvest and postharvest. Corn is the most planted crop in the United States. Every year, the corn industry loses >$1B due to infection with a fungus (Aspergillus flavus), resulting in contamination of the crop with a carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. The critical technical objectives during the project period will be to (1) identify the functional components of the product and demonstrate their mode of action; (2) assess the amounts of those components that can be produced per unit mass of bacterial biomass, (3) determine an optimal formulation of the minimal viable product that can be most effective in preventing fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination in the corn crop, and (4) conduct an optimal toxicity profiling of the minimal viable product. Upon completion, the knowledge obtained will provide valuable insights for effective intellectual protection and regulatory strategy for the products from the technology and identify any potential challenges related to scalability, consistency, and product shelf-life, which will determine the costs and logistics for large-scale manufacturing of the products.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept of using an innovative open aquatic algae cultivation system (OAACS) to overcome scale and cost constraints of current large-scale algal biomass production systems like raceway ponds. Drop-in biofuels derived from OAACS? biomass have a projected minimum fuel selling price of $2.53/gasoline gallon equivalent, which is competitive with fossil fuels, and have potential production scales that exceed current global fossil fuel usage. Successful commercialization of OAACS can lead to new sustainable energy sources, significant displacement of fossil fuel use, and concomitant reductions in the future environmental and societal impacts of global climate change. If successful, OAACS can also pave the way for sustainable, competitive, and meaningfully large-scale production of other bioproducts like fertilizers and high protein feeds.

    The proposed project aims to fabricate robust liners for OAACS using an innovative forced assembly co-extrusion and two-dimensional multiplication technique and then demonstrate their performance in OAACS scale-down laboratory photobioreactors. The minimum success criterion is production of liners that support sustained algal aerial yields >15 g ash free dry weight/m2/day for weeks or months without the need for liner cleaning or CO2 supplementation. This will establish feasibility that OAACS can meet production scale- and cost-targets. Tasks include: 1. Fabrication and physical characterization of base case liners using previously demonstrated techniques and then extending results to liners with pore size gradients and surface modified nanofibers; 2. Demonstrating high dissolved inorganic carbon transfer rates through the liners; and 3. Demonstrating robust performance of the liners during continuous culturing in laboratory photobioreactors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable discovery of needed T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapeutics for late-stage cancer patients who have limited treatment options. These immunotherapies work by leveraging T-cells engineered with TCRs that will identify and destroy cancer cells that naturally present a marker (antigen) specific to the cancer on their surface (e.g., cancer mutations). This project will develop a high-throughput platform capable of screening many thousands of TCRs against many thousands of antigens to identify clinically relevant TCRs. This project could impact society?s health by discovering TCRs that will serve as the basis for treatments against currently incurable cancers. The commercial impacts are potentially large. The total market size of T-cell therapeutics was $2.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $8.5 billion by 2027. The platform described by this proposal has the potential to discover many TCR based therapeutics, creating value for patient and society at large.

    The proposed project is to develop a platform for identifying clinically valuable TCRs. This platform could be critical for developing new immunotherapies against solid tumors and for understanding the biology that underlies TCR-antigen interaction. Screening thousands of TCRs for functional activation against thousands of antigens is challenging due to the difficulty of tracking interactions between hundreds of thousands of unique cells. The proposed platform and method links T-cell activation with phagocytosis using engineered T-macrophage and antigen presenting cell (APC) lines. T-macrophages engulf APCs as directed by TCR activation, capturing evidence of an interaction within the T-macrophage. The resulting interactions can be read from the T-macrophages via single-cell sequencing. The objective of this project is to produce large cell-based libraries for TCR and antigens and to identify interacting TCR-antigen pairs. The antigen library will include hundreds of clinically relevant cancer targets, such as KRAS and TP53. These results will demonstrate the feasibility of our platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will result in powerful technology for detecting illicit cryptocurrency accounts and funds in close to real time. The commercial and market impact of the technology will be substantial with its ability to trace illicit accounts and funds to a depth and breadth never before possible and to accomplish this in seconds to minutes, as compared to the long to indefinite time it would take conventional network tracing technology.  For society at large, the ability to uncover the most complex money laundering and fraud schemes will help cut the flow of funds to the worst actors using cryptocurrency: organized crime, narcotics dealers, child pornographers, human traffickers, terrorists, and rogue nations. With the platform created in this project, governments in conjunction with the private sector will have tools that can effectively address the sophistication of the criminal schemes.  This will in turn result in greater growth of the cryptocurrency-based economy as businesses and individuals gain greater confidence that they are dealing with legitimate entities that are not seeking to defraud them.

    This SBIR Phase I project will bring to light the most sophisticated illicit schemes involving cryptocurrencies. In doing so, it will secure cryptocurrency systems and advance the fields of network analysis and visualization, which will be needed to understand the schemes. There are three major technical hurdles in the Phase I project. First, the proposed implementation and infrastructure for the network tracing algorithms need to be scaled up to trace the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains in real-time. Second, to be able to trace addresses to known illicit accounts, a sufficient number of these accounts need to be identified. The proposed project will develop software for cross referencing account addresses with both on-chain and clear and dark web activity to build the lists of known bad actor addresses.  Third, for customers to believe the results of the analysis, a network visualization tool to show the chains of custody linking a suspect account to a known illicit account must be created. Because the algorithms can detect the schemes involving thousands of fund transfers between accounts, visualizing the links in a clear manner presents unique challenges. The project will therefore also build the foundation for its novel visualization tool in Phase I.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable very highly-efficient low-cost green hydrogen production by improving a key functional component of a promising water electrolysis technology. Green hydrogen is a chemical fuel and a feedstock with no associated CO2 emissions. In an effort to decarbonize our economy, green hydrogen can address sectors of our economy that are not easily electrified using clean electricity, for example steelmaking, chemicals, heating, and heavy transport such as shipping and aviation. However, the cost of green hydrogen is still too high to prompt large-scale adoption. The pure-water electrolyzers developed in this project can significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs compared to the current state-of-the-art: they require only water and electricity as inputs, and are entirely made of low-cost, non-toxic materials, utilizing domestic supply chains. They are modular, enabling the development of both large hydrogen production facilities and small decentralized systems, e.g., for on-site operations or refueling stations. This project will not only help the adoption of green hydrogen, it will also elucidate how the chemical and electrochemical modifications of active surfaces can more broadly be used to make electrochemical reactions, such as water splitting, more efficient.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to drastically improve a key component of an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMEL): the anode electrode. The anode is the site of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a required but inefficient step during electrolytic hydrogen production. Enhancement of the OER kinetics by improved anode design, if translated to commercial AEMEL systems, would directly lead to a lower cost of green hydrogen. This project aims to replace the conventional two-layer anode, in which a complex catalyst layer is coated on top of a porous transport layer (PTL), with a simpler ?unified? anode, in which the PTL is functionalized such that the catalyst layer is no longer necessary and the reaction kinetics are improved. In this project, two approaches to functionalize the PTL surface will be combined: the increase of the electrochemically active surface area (via etching, dealloying, and deposition techniques) and the increase of the intrinsic catalytic OER activity (via alloying and deposition techniques). This effort is expected to result in significantly improved AEMEL performance and lifetime, which will be evaluated using electrochemical methods, both ex situ (3-electrode cell) and in situ (in an operating electrolyzer).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a semiconductor laser technology based on laterally confined photonic crystal cavities. The proposed laser technology may ensure secure semiconductor and microelectronic supply chains within US for energy-efficient high-capacity data center link capabilities, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous driving/aerial vehicles, high performance communication and sensing systems, etc. The novel solution may accelerate technology development, address technical and market gaps, and foster entrepreneurship with important social impacts. The project will help prepare a diversified workforce skilled in semiconductor production, nanotechnology, photonics and optics, and advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize high speed photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSELs) with single-mode, high power output. PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project entails the development of a simple and affordable saliva-based test that will enable the detection of early Alzheimer's disease. Today, there is no single test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Because the diagnosis is complex, invasive, and expensive, these tests are only performed once symptoms, such as memory loss, begin to manifest. These symptoms of Alzheimer's disease only become apparent once the disease has already cause significant damage to the brain. The proposed test will be widely accessible and detect the disease before symptoms arise, enabling the patient to start active prevention strategies and even therapies to preserve brain health. As the American population ages ? nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 years of age or older by 2060 ? Alzheimer?s disease and other dementias are becoming a great challenge for health and social care. As part of a broad approach to prevention, this technology can potentially extend early Alzheimer?s care to millions of Americans, allowing interventions, monitoring, and treatment initiation years earlier than what is currently possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is applying sophisticated chemical analysis methods to develop a novel test to detect signs of early Alzheimer?s disease using a person?s saliva. Diseases can cause changes in the biochemical composition of body fluids such as blood or saliva. Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer?s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer?s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a lightweight, ultra-compact 3D sensor offering enhanced performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. Existing sensors on consumer electronic devices, such as those on augmented/virtual reality headsets, are limited in their perception accuracy and detection range resulting in a poor user experience, which has limited their implementation. The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities. This effort also supports domestic photonics manufacturing and assembly industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seeks to develop a novel 3D sensor design that promises performance enhancement over state-of-the-art devices. Building on a proprietary flat optics technology, the project may lead to a 3D sensor module featuring panoramic vision, significant spatial resolution improvements, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and a compact, lightweight architecture amenable to low-cost manufacturing and assembly. The project has two main goals: 1) demonstration of a 3D sensor prototype and experimental validation of its performance and 2) development of scalable manufacturing routes for fabrication of flat optics components leveraging standard microfabrication technologies.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to detect social-emotional issues in children (ages 5-12) for early intervention. A growing trend in juvenile mental health concerns was exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruption in child development. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) system that learns from interactions with the child and parent independently and can detect potential social-emotional concerns.  The ML system enables personalized evaluation and monitoring outside a clinical setting in a remote or hybrid context.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances algorithms for integration into a social-emotional skill building curriculum.  The project proposes: 1) User segmentation based on a comprehensive assessment of social-emotional functioning, 2) Correlation of the relevancy and effectiveness of modules to segmented users, and 3) Collection of information to identify social emotional deficits (red flags). These activities enable a feedback loop to learn and deliver recommendations for each child-parent dyad, personalizing learning in real-time. These algorithms learn from behavioral, social, and emotional inputs from both the parent and child when they engage with the technology. The system will also detect red flags correlated with social and emotional deficits, promoting early intervention.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a state-of-the-art, counterfeit-proof security technology to enable vaccine manufacturers to tag, track, and authenticate vaccine products throughout the supply chain. The tagging process will be amenable to its integration into a scalable glass vial manufacturing process. Digital information such as product, lot number, expiry, etc. may be embedded into the tags, if desired. In light of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, security and authentication of vaccine dosages throughout the supply chain represents a significant public health and global logistics challenge. Industry concerns over vaccine theft and counterfeit products drive the market need for an effective ID security technology that enable manufacturers to authenticate vaccines in a safe, covert, and efficient manner. The tagging process developed in this program will add minimal expenses to the manufacturing cost of each vaccine dosage form, at an estimated cost of pennies per dose.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will require the completion of several tasks, including: 1) the computational design of the taggant patterns, 2) the development of a scalable tagging process, 3) the development of instrumentation and associated software for tag authentication, and 4) the encryption of tags with digital information such as lot number, expiry, manufacturing location, or any other desired product information. In summary, the specific design parameters of the tag will be elucidated and optimized during this Phase I effort. The design parameters will subsequently be demonstrated on flat glass and glass vaccine vial prototypes using a scalable process. Finally, newly developed ?reading? instrumentation will be used to authenticate the tagged glass prototypes, demonstrating the overall utility of this anti-counterfeit technology.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project includes reductions in food waste, energy use, and carbon emissions by developing a highly efficient and adaptable system for refrigerated transport. Mini-containers, which are small, insulated boxes with environments controlled by a central driving unit that contains a refrigerator and other environmental controls are proposed. The technology may increase the economic feasibility of small farms by allowing them to target a more resilient, efficient, and potentially carbon-neutral cold supply chain. The potential impact of the research includes improved availability of nutritious food for the general population and mitigation of negative environmental effects of cold logistics. Additionally, mitigating food waste will create savings up and down the supply chain.

    Two key technical challenges are addressed in this research. The first area has, as its main objective, the development of a volume-adaptable refrigeration system that allows for the efficient operation of several levels of control to best adapt to high levels of cooling capacity needs. The second area of research corresponds to the development of the methodology and solutions algorithms to exercise a hybrid control strategy for the optimal scheduling operation of the refrigeration system. The archetype refrigeration system would be subject to constraints imposed by the heterogeneous loads stored in the different special storage and transportation units known as mini-containers which receive cooling and other environmental services.  This technology will allow for efficiently aggregating, storing, disaggregating, and distributing fresh products in the mini-containers. The mini-containers will allow the emergence of efficient cold logistics for small loads by enabling the capacity of large transportation containers to be split among multiple conveyances. The proposed solution will also make it possible to convert almost any truck into a refrigerated truck and any warehouse into a cold storage facility, supporting the emergence of sharing economies in cold logistics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is found in its ability to provide a novel tool for clinicians for perioperative, post-surgical, and chronic pain management. This technology supports enhanced patient safety, international standards for enhanced recovery after surgery, reduced addiction potential and opioid sparing, reduced loading on clinicians and healthcare resources, reduced cost of healthcare services, and advanced capability of clinicians through training. The commercial impact exists in all facets of healthcare, including perioperative procedures, in-hospital step-down and recovery, ambulatory surgery center procedures, and chronic pain management. The potential exists to expand into other clinical markets including the military and first responders. This technology can support the national defense of the country by providing advanced care capability for wounded troops on the front lines, in recovery, and through rehabilitation. The solution also applies to use during times of national, state, and local crisis, and, as the hospital-at-home trend increases, that market can be pursued. Ultimately, the commercial impact exists in both worldwide use and in contributing to the overall projected increase in use of regional blocks in the coming decade.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project applies technology to a medical application that has not been addressed for over 130 years.  Based on clinical needs, a minimally viable device (MVP) has been developed and prototyped that objectively quantifies neural blockades. This project advances the capability of the MVP and advances information about the real-time in vivo status of a neural blockade. The goal is to assure device robustness under challenging clinical conditions, for different neural blockade types, and for physiologically diverse patient populations. The plan to reach these goals is to apply human factors and design engineering standards to the MVP to assure that: a) the user displays are readily understood, provide the expected information in an appropriate form and format, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; b) the user controls perform the required functions, are complete, reflect the appropriate nomenclature for the clinical environment, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; and c) the monitor is reliable, well fabricated, safe for the patient and user, and completely supports the acquisition, processing, display, and recording of pertinent data. The resulting technology will be a robust patient monitoring device that assures patient safety and optimized treatment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of the first all-in-one automated syphilis test available at the point-of-care. The number of syphilis cases in the United States have doubled in the past 5 years with a five-fold increase in congenital syphilis passed from a pregnant mother to the fetus. Annual infections now account for $170 million in lifetime medical costs. This low-cost, portable test will enable care providers and outreach efforts to immediately diagnose and treat patients in a single visit to halt the spread of syphilis infections in the most vulnerable populations. Syphilis testing in this platform will be readily combined with hybrid detection of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) to streamline syphilis testing with existing programs for HIV diagnosis and further encourage uptake of this test solution into clinical practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for easier syphilis testing solutions to provide comprehensive diagnosis on-site with the patient. Syphilis diagnosis relies on two separate antibody tests, of which one requires quantifying antibody levels with a tedious laboratory procedure called Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) to confirm if the patient has an active infection. The lack of resources and personnel to conduct RPR testing on-site severely limits the ability of public health clinics to effectively diagnosis syphilis in a timely manner. This project will combine both antibody tests including quantitative RPR into an automated cartridge for rapid and complete syphilis diagnosis at the point-of-care. The research proposed in this project will develop magnetic particle-enabled assays for each antibody test and integrate the assays into a multiplexed plastic cartridge. These cartridges, combined with a portable instrument, will enable all steps required for syphilis diagnosis to be completed within minutes in an affordable and easy-to-use format.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to empower the processors of harvested fruits and vegetables with the flexibility to use robotic automation to meet their labor needs. The automation uses collaborative robots (cobots) guided by computer vision, which are potentially safe around humans. The technology will help assure consistent produce quality and processing rates. Through a robust cobot-based solution, the project will provide an affordable, sustainable, and safe means for farms of all sizes to keep up with their production goals, which will sustain competition and the nation?s food supply. This project has the added benefit of upskilling workers in farms by creating openings for more technically oriented positions, both in monitoring and maintaining the cobots. Instead of tediously programming the cobot for each use, the project is introducing a new way of translating the tasks performed by humans to the cobot by learning from camera recordings. It will also improve understanding of how cobots can safely be used alongside humans in a shared working space.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project aims to make it possible to use cobots with human workers on tasks that go beyond the traditional pick-and-place. The proposed technology will automate processing line tasks that require computer vision, which is challenging because accurate and reliable perception must guide the robot?s motion. Research has coalesced the technical challenges on the path to a viable commercial product around five steps. These start with a formal description of the task domain followed by using robust implementations of noise-tolerant machine learning algorithms for automatically learning the task, and end with a solution that integrates the learned task behavior with a vision-guided cobot system. Phase 1 will support research toward addressing two problems. The first is to design an intuitive way to elicit a precise specification of the client?s task domain. A digital conversational assistant will utilize multiple modalities for the elicitation. The second is the inability of available implementations to generate coworker-aware and efficient cobot movements. The research will investigate and develop significant improvements to the cobot motion to improve coworker safety while reducing the processing time by an expected 50%.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel mixed-mode (wind, wave, current) ocean energy converter that aims to be an improvement over the state-of-the-art offshore wind turbine design. This project will clarify design specifications to target a low-cost product with production scalability. Markets with the largest opportunity to benefit from this solution include US grid power, remote US islands (Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, US Virgin Islands), other remote islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, and dispatchable power sources for emergency power generation like the Department of Defense. The environmental benefit of advancing the design of renewable energy converters and reducing the initial investments required by offshore clean energy may positively impact both the scope and the timeline for adoption of ocean renewables in the US.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an efficient energy converter that drastically lowers the cost per installed unit through reduced weight of product components, onshore assembly, simplified installation, a lower center of gravity, and by achieving a storm rating. When coupled with offshore energy storage, this technology has the potential to unlock energy capture in ocean sites further offshore than is presently feasible. This project builds upon initial concept modeling and a 1/20 scale prototype construction, which validates the weight/power ratio, device stability, and comprehensive analytical evidence for commercial feasibility. Keeping the final cost-to-kilowatt low, while optimizing the overall design will be the major technical focus of the work plan, along with mitigating strategies for the risk of severe weather survivability. The proposed research will approach the design of each component individually with a focus on reducing cost and weight, while optimizing strength and output. Through the construction and testing of a proposed prototype, the team will conduct detailed analyses on scalability, performance, and cost factors that are critical for commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel, portable, diagnostic device for non-invasively diagnosing myocardial infarctions (MI) and ischemia in real-time with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. The system aims to provide an accurate point-of-care clinical classification for the 805,000 heart attack cases occurring in the US each year with a real-time diagnostic and monitoring tool. The system aims to significantly reduce the time needed with current invasive sampling and blood analysis measures, thereby improving patient outcomes during the first critical hours of an MI while saving healthcare resources and improving efficiency. The portable nature of the technology enables other forms of integration including at home, in clinic, hospital bedside use, or field use applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a proof-of-concept diagnostic-prognostic machine learning-based system for detecting MI. The scope of activities includes testing multiple techniques and models and producing distribution analyses and event plots of training data in order to optimize performance compared to clinically adjudicated events. Success measures include a data model which, when using their proprietary external noninvasive transdermal biomarker sensor with their wearable garment electrocardiograms (EKGs), are able to detect MI with > 85% accuracy.  The device will also be able to detect clinically relevant ischemia with > 85% accuracy. These results will progress the company?s objective of completing a standalone, noninvasive, real-time diagnostic and remote monitoring tool.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a commercial building management system that uses model predictive control for small to mid-sized commercial building owners to help them flexibly manage increasingly complex energy codes and prices. This technology uses machine learning to automate costly aspects of advanced building control, and eliminating complexity, frustration, and expense for leanly staffed building owners who are attempting to save money, meet code, reduce carbon footprint and adapt to rapidly changing energy prices. The proposed approach significantly reduces the setup time, the amount of training data, and the compute time needed for the technology to converge on accurate models and predictions using building thermal dynamics. These improvements reduce the controller costs without sacrificing accuracy. This technology will simplify the setup and implementation process for under-represented segments in the building automation, efficiency and model-based controls market starting with K-12 schools. This simplification has several distinct societal and environmental benefits including: increased energy and demand charge savings, increased energy efficiency, improved environmental footprint, increased job creation for building controls technicians, improved resiliency, and additional educational opportunities for K-12 families and communities.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology capable of building efficiency control.  The innovation employs a hybrid approach based on constrained deep learning tools that build on physical knowledge of building systems and architecture, thereby making use of sampling data while producing physics-consistent accuracy in modeling and control predictions. Specifically, the project team hopes to converge on an architecture that can more reliably and accurately manage energy use and occupant comfort compared to state of the art control approaches. The project team also aims to demonstrate a significant reduction in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)-driven peak system demand in target buildings while keeping instrumentation, labor, and data costs per building to an affordable cost for the target market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of technology that unlocks the use of abundantly available geothermal hot dry rock energy for reliable renewable energy. This technology will be economically feasible and provide an optional zero emission cogeneration configuration for harnessing cooling loop waste heat from zero emissions thermal electric power plants. The additional benefits, broader impacts, and market opportunity for cogeneration applications create an increase in power generation efficiency and capacity.  Increases in net zero emissions power will also be available at utility scale. This technology will reduce water use during wet cooling in power plants by replacing the iconic supplemental cooling towers for thermal electric power plants worldwide with cogeneration. Some larger and long-term societal impacts of this research include: a more stable power grid due to reliable geothermal renewable energy generation and a cleaner environment especially for populations living close to traditional power plants and industrial infrastructure. Global technology licensing applications include: grid flexing and resiliency, water desalination/filtration, green hydrogen production, and national security.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop software that uses computation, measurement, observations, and computer models, based on sound theory to find operational boundaries, validate key performance metrics, and optimize functional parameters for more efficient power production. This research includes the examination of critical technology functions and elements that determine peak operational efficiencies. The goal of this research will be to produce analytical computer models to look specifically at: 1) air intake velocity for a given set of pressure differentials, 2) air intake impedance, 3) thermal/pressure gradients generated by heat exchange activity, 4) air flow impedance generated by heat exchangers, and 5) expected exhaust air flow given idealized intake, heat exchange configurations, and designs. Anticipated results will provide quantifiable and measurable data tables including system sizing, energy input requirements, and mechanical and organic inlet air flow with emphasis on modeling of data analysis and determining specific energy inputs and power outputs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on improved methods for detecting and suppressing sea lampreys in the Great Lakes, a pest species that currently requires relentless, sustained, and costly control efforts at ecosystem scale. The project initiates the development of small, relocatable, field-deployed devices, capable of performing a range of assessment and selective control functions. Success in this effort will introduce an important new tool to bolster environmental health outcomes at an ecosystem level, and benefit commercial fisheries estimated at $7B annually. By replacing chemical and manual control of exotic invaders, the project contributes to the preservation of ecosystem integrity and function, biodiversity, and environmental quality of the Great Lakes, a vital natural resource providing water security for more than 35 million people in the region. With worldwide damage from aquatic invaders exceeding $300 billion annually, innovations driving advances in ecosystem protection and restoration will have wide appeal and application wherever habitats require protection. Broadening the available tool set empowers managers and local communities to act against exotic invaders at the level where causes and consequences are most acutely felt.


    This project performs a feasibility study of existing technologies from aquaculture workflows for adaptation to the uncrewed control of sea lampreys in the field. The essential features of such a device are inherently similar to recently emerged solutions for automated fish management in robotic aquaculture systems. Existing models for detection and classification are expected to transfer well to a class as morphologically distinct as lampreys. The primary challenges to this project most likely arise from the unique biology and sensory ecology of a species whose responses to the physical device used here are completely unknown. A set of artificial stream experiments aims to entrain lampreys into devices placed into their path. How might lamprey react to a device optimized for the specific needs of imaging, classification, and selective removal? Informed by detailed knowledge of lamprey chemosensory ecology, the work also examines the efficacy of pheromonal cues for channeling lamprey movement through the device.

    \ for increasingly complex (or diverse) structures (shapes, sizes, and materials)\
    \ to be accurately identified and subsequently sorted. This approach produces\
    \ an ordered stream of objects, which can then be sorted according to any diversion\
    \ scheme for efficient recycling. The software uses semi-supervised learning to\
    \ allow for domain adaptation from a centralized training set, enabling rapid\
    \ implementation of optimized sorting schemes of site-specific waste streams,\
    \ requiring significantly less human intervention than traditionally needed. Successful\
    \ development would result in a simplified sorting platform that is cheaper, more\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new generation of smart machines used in the measurement of parts and assemblies. The team has demonstrated that this technology can convert existing coordinate measuring machines to self-driving autonomous machines. The ability to automatically measure parts is an important feedback link in the process chain that will enable fully automated manufacturing of the future. Specifically, this automation will reduce the specialized skill required to use a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The innovation will enable workers to operate a CMM and get a precise part measurement. This device is especially helpful as the skilled manufacturing/metrology workforce is retiring as it gives new employees the ability to provide accurate information with little/no training. This innovation also gives the manufacturing companies an option to buy a new machine or upgrade their existing coordinate measuring machine. While the focus of this proposal is part identification, this technology has ready applications in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, robotics, and automated assembly lines. This capability will make the US manufacturing sector stronger and more technologically advanced.

    The objective of this proposal is to develop a new technology to identify machined parts and assemblies. This technology will be implemented on coordinate measuring machines (CMM), which are used widely in the manufacturing sector to measure the shape and size of parts. The proposed technology will enable autonomous measurements of parts allowing a higher level of automation. In this identification technology, the team will use live images from a camera, multiple solid model/Computer Aided Design (CAD)-generated images, and advanced image processing. Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to the image processing of part images will ensure correct part identification. Correct identification of parts as seen by the camera is the remaining unsolved challenge to achieving self-driven automatic measurements of parts. Most machined parts are textureless and most of the information is contained in the edges. Current image processing techniques work well with texture-rich parts but are unreliable with textureless machined parts. AI/ML enhanced image processing using edge and shape information is a promising approach, solving this problem will lead to the birth of a new generation of CMMs that can measure parts automatically.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a marketable and cost-effective U.S. manufactured foundation system to support offshore wind turbines (OWTs). The planned offshore wind energy production in the U.S. has been growing rapidly and the industry is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion within the next two decades. Although only 42 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy were installed in the U.S. during the last 10 years, planned projects have been growing rapidly targeting 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050, with strong support from coastal states. Achieving the targets of offshore wind energy requires cost-effective and innovative components of these energy systems. One of the main costs for offshore wind energy systems is their foundations, with costs typically ranging from 14% to 34% of the overall project cost. OWTs are commonly supported on large-diameter foundations, which the U.S. does not have the capability to fabricate and instead relies on foundations fabricated abroad. Therefore, a U.S.-manufactured foundation system to support renewable offshore wind energy infrastructure, enhance domestic supply chains, and reduce dependency on foreign manufactured foundations is proposed. The result of this research is a U.S.-manufactured alternative with savings of over half the cost per meter, enabling wider adoption of alternative energy harnessing technologies.


    The goal of the proposed project is to develop a U.S.-manufactured, bio-inspired, enhanced capacity foundation system to support offshore wind energy infrastructure that provides technical improvements and cost-saving to currently used systems. The proposed project also provides: (1) ease of adoption by providing similar weight and installation approaches to current means and methods; (2) better durability and longer service life than currently used OWT foundations; and (3) improved speed of construction promoting scalability. Furthermore, the proposed system will allow for optimized design, increasing the foundation capacity and improving the installation process.  Preliminary tests show that the proposed design could improve the foundation capacity by up to 100% compared to that of the currently used foundation systems when subjected to long-term cyclic loading similar to those experienced by OWTs.  The proposed concept could be used as a driven pile, suction caisson, anchors, or gravity base providing several options for the offshore wind energy industry in the U.S. To achieve the project goal, this research will focus on: (1) verification of key material properties for marine environmental conditions, (2) structural design of foundation cross-sections, (3) installation analyses on proposed foundations in marine environments; and (4) investigations of the effects of the bio-inspired design on foundation capacity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on development of a handheld optical scanner that integrates precise imaging with optical spectroscopy.  Although this technology has broad applications ranging from industrial quality control to education, the beachhead sector to be addressed is precision agriculture. To feed a growing population of 10 billion in 2050, agricultural production will need to increase by 70% over the next 30 years. Critical to this mission is the development of innovative tools and strategies for crop protection and health management to preserve the world?s food supply. The potential customers in this segment are crop growers, consultants, and field scouts aiming to act early while reducing the use of harmful and costly chemicals. The global crop monitoring market was estimated at $2 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $6 billion by 2027, growing at 15.3% annually. The sensing and imaging segment accounted for 49.3% of the market in 2019. This technology has the potential to support the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices as well as the economic viability of small- to medium-scale farm operations in the U.S. by providing an accessible and affordable tool for disease detection and crop health management.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the commercial development of novel and affordable imaging spectroscopy technology in addition to application-specific analytics for the early detection of crop afflictions. Optical components of the scanning device that will be designed-for-manufacturing in this project bridge the current gap created by systems that trade the detection capabilities of spectral resolution for spatial resolution. The scanner will be deployed to collect data on grapes, a key, high-value crop that is susceptible to a number of afflictions that destroy yields before the human eye can detect them. Machine learning algorithms will be developed from this data to detect stressed and diseased states in the plant before they become apparent to visual inspection. These models will then be validated in the field with user feedback from horticultural experts and customers. Successful implementation of this technology will facilitate the detection of crop diseases before they spread. This detection capability can increase yields while reducing the use of costly and environmentally-harmful pesticides and fertilizers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop autonomous, ocean-going cargo vessels powered by a combination of wind and solar power. These vessels will enable the provision of cheaper and more frequent sea freight service to isolated communities, such as those in coastal Alaska. The technology seeks to the lower operating costs by removing liquid or solid fuels or onboard crew, enabling the vessels to be more readily right-sized to particular routes and markets. The project may also have positive impacts on the environment by eliminating fossil fuel emissions and reducing marine noise impacts on wildlife, such as marine mammals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate existing robotic and energy capture technologies with newly developed wind/solar combined energy optimization software and autonomous contingency management. A vessel using both the wind and sun for propulsion has a difficult energy optimization problem, both on a minute-to-minute basis but also on the scale of an entire voyage; This project will build a model for solving this intermitancy problem given specific vessel performance characteristics and weather predictions. Likewise, this project will build a framework for addressing the autonomous contingency management problem for uncrewed marine surface vehicles given a particular set of vehicle and system characteristics. The focus will be on ship-to-shore communications contingencies because those are the most serious for the contemplated target system.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology platform for storing biological materials that will improve public health outcomes and enable the storage of the ever-expanding digital data universe. Nucleic acids are the new bits of the 21st century; they encode our health and can be repurposed as alternative storage media for digital data. Harnessing the information encoded in these biological materials requires a scalable way to store and access nucleic acids. For decades, we have relied on energy-intensive low-temperature storage and expensive robotics to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids, which are not scalable. The successful outcome of this proposal is an alternative solution to store massive amounts of nucleic acids, obviating the need for freezers and enabling new products that leverage nucleic acid materials.

    The proposed project will lay the foundation for developing a low-cost scalable solution for nucleic acid materials. Current approaches are limited by the requirement of low temperature to circumvent the degradation of nucleic acids, requiring a constant supply of electricity and expensive robotics. Instead, the proposed project focuses on maintaining the integrity of nucleic acids for decades at room temperature and simultaneously enabling search and retrieval functions akin to a computer or internet search engine by leveraging the rapid diffusion of molecules in solution. This ambitious goal will be achieved by using novel synthetic polymers that are made compatible with biological materials to enable rapid encapsulation of nucleic acids while providing long-term protection without the need for low temperature. The resulting synthetic polymers discovered through the project will be tested using purified nucleic acids, including animal, bacterial, or viral genomes, to demonstrate the capabilities and breadth of materials that can be used for the proposed technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop bio-based antioxidant products for industrial processes. Commercial development of peptide antioxidants has been limited for use in consumer, food, or therapeutic applications. This project will develop peptide antioxidants derived from the enzymatic digestion of agricultural biomass as alternatives to synthetic antioxidants used in the processing and storage of industrial fluids. Although synthetic antioxidants are critical for the stabilization of many industrial processes, they are derived from petroleum and tend to have toxicity and/or environmental safety concerns. The products resulting from this effort will be first-in-class innovations; safer and more environmentally responsible than existing products. Project activities will validate peptide performance in the initial target application area: the stabilization of vinyl monomer fluids and processes. This research will initially focus on vinyl monomer processing as well as four additional industrial markets where sustainable antioxidants could have a high impact. The estimated consumption of synthetic antioxidants in the five combined markets in 2022 will be close to 1 million tons.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a bio-based antioxidant product derived from sustainable materials and suitable for industrial process fluids. Antioxidant peptides derived from the enzymatic digestion of plant-based proteins have the potential to replace synthetic antioxidants in industrial processes. This project focuses on process compatibility, product stability, and antioxidative performance as key technical hurdles. This project will create a library of antioxidative peptides generated by the enzymatic digestion of plant proteins. This library will then be tested for the solubility of peptides with representative fluids under process conditions, potential formulation design, and for thermal and storage stability of the designed formulations. This project will lower technical barriers to advancing the commercial development of peptide antioxidants for applications across many industries.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential reduction of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from marine diesel engines. There are approximately 4 million diesel-powered craft in use globally, emitting approximately one billion tons of CO2 and 100 million tons of NOx annually. This project seeks to remove at least 80% of the NOx and 30% of the CO2 from marine diesel exhaust, contributing to a reduction in both greenhouse gas emissions and in air pollution that creates health hazards in coastal cities. There is no alternative, commercially-viable product that reduces CO2 and NOx emissions from marine diesel engines. The proposed concept seeks to overcome the disadvantages of competing technologies that are unworkable due to heat and space restraints in a confined boat engine room. The project may enable boat manufacturers to meet new international maritime regulations on engine emissions and may contribute new knowledge related to the engineering of monitoring and delivery systems for marine and land/vehicle emissions reduction systems. In addition to environmental benefits, the technology meets a global commercial demand and creates good paying jobs for an export-oriented US industry.

    The goal of this project is to develop a low thermal electro-emulsification solution to reduce emissions in marine diesel exhaust, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 80% to meet the new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 30%. The technology will be incorporated into a fuel processing system that can be integrated into existing diesel engines on marine boats. This system will precisely inject reaction-altering chemicals at the proper time in the combustion cycle to reach the desired reduction of CO2 and NOx. The system will also monitor the exhaust stream to ensure no harmful byproducts are discharged into the marine environment. This work will further develop the understanding of diesel emissions reduction and may be transferable to other vehicle and land-based applications.
