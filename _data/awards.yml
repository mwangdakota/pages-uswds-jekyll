    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to significantly reduce the number of injuries or deaths suffered by pavement marking workers on public streets and roads, while increasing the efficiency and lowering costs by using an operator-driven, truck-mounted, mobile robotic pavement marking system. Robotic painting allows workers to remain in the safety of the truck cab, protecting them from traffic.  Increased efficiency will help to minimize work zone congestion and duration, while reduced costs will enable safer and more productive streetscapes for the general public. Studies have repeatedly confirmed that streetscapes with a high density of transverse marking features such as shared center turning lanes, dedicated bike lanes with separation buffer zones, and pedestrian-friendly crosswalks result in measurable public health benefits, enhanced quality of life, increased commercial activity, and, counterintuitively, more efficient traffic flow with fewer collisions. The project will also better enable precise placement of new markings and precise overpainting of worn or eroded markings, both important factors for connected and autonomous vehicles. An earlier phase of the project has already resulted in enhancements to camera calibration techniques for machine vision.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to build on a successful Phase I effort to enable a commercially-viable robotic road painting system that addresses the need to protect the lives of human workers engaged in the dangerous task of stenciling roadway markings such as turn arrows or bike symbols. The project may also improve the accuracy and ease of application of markings needed to support autonomous vehicle-ready roadways. The research will apply advanced software, machine vision, an augmented-reality user interface, and proprietary robotic trajectory planning technologies to support ultraprecision painting in the real-world environment while keeping human workers safe in the cab of the operator-driven truck upon which the robot is mounted. The solution will enable robots to paint previously unmarked pavement and to repaint existing marks. The combined hardware and software solution will be capable of recording all planned and completed markings in a cloud-hosted database?an innovation that will streamline the processes.  The technology will also form a cloud-based standard for mapping and recording universal road markings and support the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate safely. While much of the research can initially be performed in simulation, significant real-world testing and validation will be required as well.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to allow America?s grape industry to reduce crop losses due to spring frost, estimated at over $1 billion per year, as well as related job losses ? more than 11,000 individuals in the State of Washington alone.  The encapsulating bud break delay technology and predictive analytics support farmers with decision making tools ahead of impending frost events during bud break season.  Such tools may enable rural communities to achieve economic stability by decreasing yield losses and lowering production costs.  The technology fills gaps in knowledge needed to make informed decisions on individual farms, resulting in better management decisions in the face of increasing complexities of spring freeze threats. Additionally, use of the encapsulation technology may reduce carbon emissions and water usage from current fossil fuel-intensive conventional frost mitigation measures such as burners, wind machines and sprinklers.

    The proposed encapsulating bud break delay technology involves two main advances. First, a gel encapsulation spray biologically delays the process of bud break consistently up to 14 days and increases cold resistance up to 6 degrees Celsius. Second, to guide growers in delivering this product, a Decision Support System (DSS) aids grape growers in deciding when it is necessary to mitigate pending frost conditions. The Phase II project focuses on increasing the predictive accuracy of the DSS and scaling the system. Specifically, the team will focus on: a) optimizing the formulation and testing in the lab, b) field-testing and data collection at five sites, c) enhancing DSS capabilities with additional data and analysis, d) scaling up for large-scale manufacture and application, and e) gathering data for regulatory approvals. This gel encapsulation solution for frost protection of vineyards may find future applications in other fruits crops such as apples and stones fruits that are even more susceptible to spring frost damage than grapes.

    \ studies showed that such water stream patterns increase suppression rates by\
    \ three times for vegetation fires while using less than half the water. In the\
    \ proposed Phase II work, the nozzles will be optimized for structural fires.\
    \ Additionally, as part of the Phase II work, an adjustable smooth-bore nozzle\

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of renewable electricity.  Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by 2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account for as much as 85% of total costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at scale.

    This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the productivity, environmental sustainability, and profitability of soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is a major driver of rainforest deforestation, motivating improved yields for environmental sustainability.  In addition, current commercial soybean varieties are highly susceptible to Asian soybean rust, an aggressive fungal disease that is especially severe in tropical and subtropical climates and can decimate soybean yield. This disease is controlled by chemical fungicides that are expensive, pose risks to the environment and human health, and are becoming less effective as the pathogen develops tolerance to over-used chemicals. This project will enable the development of soybean varieties immune to this disease. This will reduce the need for fungicide use in soybean cultivation, reduce yield loss caused by the pathogen, and improve grower profitability. In addition, this technology can be expanded to other crops.

    The proposed project will result in the identification of new plant disease resistance traits with activity against the pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust. The typical plant species has hundreds of immune receptor genes which surveil for the presence of invading pathogens. Plant breeders routinely use plant immune receptor genes to develop new disease-resistant crop varieties. However, traditional methods to identify and translate these traits are time-consuming. The proposed work utilizes a rapid gene discovery platform to accelerate identification of new disease resistance traits. This project will identify and test several resistance traits. The identification and cloning of these resistance gene sequences will allow them to be quickly moved into elite soybean varieties, resulting in significant time and labor savings relative to traditional breeding. These traits can be stacked together to confer durable resistance against a broad range of Asian soybean rust strains.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

    \ locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into\
    \ a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer\
    \ and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping.\
    \ The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial\
    \ objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale\
    \ products represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are\
    \ ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet\
    \ extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on\
    \ extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the\
    \ ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise\
    \ in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet\
    \ 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs\
    \ by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and\
    \ feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics. \n\n\nre:3D intends to leverage\
    \ Phase I research conducted on material requirements for polyethylene terephthalate\
    \ (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available reclaimed plastics worldwide,\
    \ to further optimize the pellet printer to be able to accept reclaimed flake\
    \ as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include developing the ability\
    \ to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean and switch between\
    \ materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake\
    \ into the platform will also be developed with the requisite controls. Once complete,\
    \ the company will pilot the solution in Texas through IC2 as well as in Puerto\
    \ Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain, in conjunction with\
    \ waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science & Research Trust.\
    \ The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2 will be incorporated\
    \ into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan Technological University's\
    \ (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior\
    \ work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source\
    \ firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively\
    \ tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used\
    \ for casting, mold production and load bearing applications. Once the prototype\
    \ design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU and field-tested,\
    \ all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort to scale the\
    \ solution suite to multiple platforms as quickly as possible. The hardware will\
    \ be sold commercially after completing the project as both an integrated 3D printing\
    \ solution and also as independent hardware due to the potential to be applied\
    \ beyond Cartesian 3D printing systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seek to improve the quality of life for manufacturing workers, help U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improve the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells may reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The developed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants perform the low-level tedious tasks. Moreover, this technology enables the human operator to guide the team operation. This ability will improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. performing composite fabrication. Most of these companies face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn. These challenges lead to longer delivery times. This project may  enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, the technology may enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing the reliance on human labor and easily scaling production capacity with the change in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robotic sanding solution for high-mix applications by providing safety under uncertainty during robotic sanding and reducing cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient trajectories by the robot. This award will make computational advances to enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description.  The project will also enable the computational algorithms to account for the uncertainties present in the environment, making robots useful for sanding operations in high-mix applications. A robotic sanding cell for handling large parts in high-mix applications will be developed by selecting the appropriate sensors and tools. Algorithms will be developed for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell while the workpiece is secured with a cost-effective, general-purpose, low-cost fixture. Algorithms will be developed to determine the minimum number of setups needed for sanding large parts in the robotic cell and to generate robot trajectories to produce tool motion patterns that ensure efficient and safe sanding operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the resiliency of the supply chain by implementing flexible robotic systems for materials handling.  The robotic systems that are controlled by artificial intelligence. E-commerce sales are increasing 20% year over year. During the COVID-19 pandemic additional retail volume shifted online and many customers became accustomed to sourcing essentials using e-commerce. This shift has put a greater burden on asupply chain infrastructure that has traditionally relied on human labor to pick, sort, pack, and process items for delivery. These manual processes are monotonous, error-prone, and sometimes dangerous, have extremely high worker turnover. The automation of these processes elevates worker roles and brings greater consistency to the processes. The innovation developed during this Phase II project may enable broader automation of complex materials handling processes by creating novel training systems for artificial intelligence-enabled robotic systems that are configured specifically for individual customer needs. This innovation may increase US supply chain resilience, enabling citizens to rapidly and reliably obtain necessities such as food, medicine, and health supplies without needing to leave their homes. The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device supporting multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. The success of this project would not only benefit patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce health care expenditures by decreasing the length of hospitalization as well as associated medical resources. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research brings together academic collaborators from different fields of expertise. The project provides a unique experience and training for engineers and scientists in the fields of neural interface design and medical device experiments, bridging the gap between the engineering and medical communities, as well as promoting and cultivating future neural engineers to focus on developing emerging/unmet diagnostic and therapeutic devices for improving human health.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops and demonstrates a wireless, miniaturized, intraluminal bioelectronic capsule capable of performing on-demand neuromodulation and multi-modality sensing on the gastrointestinal tract, supporting closed-loop neuromodulation. The device will be tested and characterized on benchtop and also through porcine models to demonstrate its potential for treating and monitoring post-surgical complications. The lengthy process of diagnosing and treating post-surgical complications significantly increases healthcare costs. Costs from hospitalization time alone exceed $2,000 per day for post-operative ileus alone.  Additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could reduce hospitalization time, accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life for patients. The success of this project has the potential to bring disruptive impact and revolution to the current pharmaceutical-based post-surgical management and treatment. In addition, the technology developed during this project may be useful to treat other chronic diseases and injuries that are incurable pharmaceutically.  The technique may be used as research tools for investigating the biological mechanisms and new therapeutics for different diseases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide economic benefits to farmers and consumers as well as broader societal benefits in the U.S. and globally for many different farm operations (e.g., vegetable, flower, and herb growers as well as greenhouse operations) and farm customers.  Higher farm productivity directly benefits society by expanding the availability of nutritious, affordable food. Vegetables are vital U.S. crops in terms of food sources and farm profitability.  One of the main challenges for vegetable farmers that limits productivity and total yield is the need to grow starter plants for the vegetables in greenhouses (or to purchase them) and then transplant them into tilled soil, which is highly labor-intensive and expensive.  This system replaces that process with a system that plants pre-germinated seeds directly into the field with precision at a projected cost of 26% of the incumbent methods.  The technology is an all-electric system that reduces the use of fossil fuels used in planting 100% and is 75% lighter weight than incumbent transplanting solutions using diesel tractors. The technology also addresses the increasing scarcity of farm labor with an autonomous planting system using automatic guidance and machine learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to solve the problem of separating pre-germinated seeds in a batch of thixotropic gel such that one and only one pre-germinated seed is planted at each desired location in real-time under actual field planting conditions.  Plant scientists have proven in numerous scientific studies that planting pre-germinated seeds increases production and lowers costs.  Reliable field planters have not been successful, however. The primary research objective is to prove that an autonomous seed-singulation system combining flow controls, seed detection, active machine learning, singulation, and extrusion in real-time can meet the requirements of the field to prove commercial viability.  The project research will begin by using discrete event simulation to model the singulation process used to obtain optimal parameters for the system. The model?s output will be used to develop control algorithms and programs.  A prototype autonomous system will be developed to test the algorithms in actual field conditions. The anticipated result of this research is that the system can reliably plant one and only one seed at each desired location at least 90% of the time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves both reduced costs for technology companies as well as increased access to cutting-edge engineering jobs for people from all backgrounds.  Commercializing this product will provide the market with an innovative, automated solution that reduces the time hiring managers spend on recruiting and growing the best candidates.  Until now, metacognitive skill development has been the purview of in-person mentors ? a practice that provides fewer on-ramps into engineering careers for individuals from backgrounds historically underrepresented in technology as they often lack access to in-person engineer mentors. A scalable system which delivers metacognitive benefits to users in an automated way may create greater access to technology education by reducing the need for in-person mentorship. The product will also enable job seekers to enhance their engineering potential by strengthening the "hard to teach" practices which distinguish professional engineers from aspiring ones. Overall, the product commercialized during Phase II seeks to increase broader participation in engineering careers and a more equitable set of hiring practices in technology companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project brings cutting-edge Cognitive Science to bear on the problems of manual candidate screening and ongoing employee upskilling. For the first-time, it marries an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and opens the door to build talent pipelines for individuals whose metacognitive traits match closely with the needs of tech employers.  The proposed project combines key advances in the field of Cognitive Science with best practices in software design in order to create novel user interactions inside a Computer-Based Learning Environment (CBLE).  Objectives include: 1) collecting microdata (also called "trace data") from user interactions to make automated inferences about the user's metacognitive traits and 2) creating inputs designed to foster metacognitive growth.  Correlating real-time trace data with metacognitive ability is a new area of research enabled only recently by the increased adoption of CBLEs.  The proposed project contributes to the fields of Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction by validating novel methods measuring metacognition against existing static look-back techniques. The project also pioneers new modes of delivering personalized metacognitive growth through CBLE interaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, high-performance platform to monitor and characterize plankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be harmful or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns and economic consequences, such as billions lost annually in the aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms and sea lice. The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collections and evaluation. In contrast, the proposed platform may enable low-cost, portable and fast monitoring, as well as automated characterization of harmful aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, this platform will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets such as marine biology science and STEM education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, and production algae monitoring. The proposed technology is envisioned to have a significant societal impact and commercial potential.

    This project may result in a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput aquatic microobjects monitoring instrument.  The instrument will have a wide spectrum of applications and initial focus on aquaculture market. The technology will initially focus on early identification of specific microorganisms, such as sea lice and harmful algae as they are detrimental to the wellbeing of aquaculture animals. This demonstration will provide high quality data at an affordable price to ensure confidence and credibility to aquaculture farmers, marine scientists, and other users interested in aquatic microobjects characterization. To accomplish this plan, several operating regimes will be implemented enabling the device to switch from high-resolution (monitoring harmful algae) to high-throughput (identifying sea lice).  An autofluorescent camera module will be developed to further assist with differentiating microorganisms. Next, an innovative neural network framework will be developed and tested for identification of different types of sea lice and harmful algae. Finally, the system will be integrated into an environmentally protected enclosure and rigorously tested in laboratory, as well as in-field in realistic conditions. At the end of the Phase II program a prototype will be completed that will be designed in coordination with aquaculture partners and prospective users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient system for robust point-of-care blood tests.  The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and represent a bottleneck.  This Phase II effort will explore the design and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated by comparison
    of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead separation assay with a conventional centrifugation process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the efficiency of air traffic operations and increase airport and airspace capacity utilization, enabling reductions in emissions, noise impact, flight delays, and operational costs of airports and airlines. The anticipated result is to produce a software platform that will become an industry standard used by 200 major metropolitan airports and over 50 airlines globally, addressing an available market of over $100 Million. The technology may contribute to a sustainable future aviation system that enables economic growth, while minimizing environmental impact. Preliminary development and testing of the technology in New York indicates the potential to increase airport and airspace capacity by as much as 20%, with savings for delays, fuel burn, noise impact and controller workload from 10%-21%, and cost savings of $2 Billion/year. The proposed innovation may increase the understanding of airspace operations and related trade-offs by bridging the gap between aviation professionals and the public through 3D visualizations of proposed airspace changes and quantification of their expected impacts on the environment and safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a software platform for integrated airspace and airport system planning, design, and management. Currently, airport authorities, airlines, and air navigation service providers use legacy software tools for the above. These tools are outdated and difficult to use, fail to properly quantify trade-offs between design objectives, and produce unsustainable design solutions leading to sub-optimal system performance. The research objectives of this project are to unify the disjointed functions of design, planning and performance evaluation of airport operations, quantify trade-offs between competing design objectives, and optimize for system efficiency in terms of maximizing safety and capacity while minimizing delays, emissions, noise, fuel burn and operational cost. To achieve this, the company will work with major airports and airlines to identify key requirements, develop tractable mathematical models for addressing the tasks and validate the results via application in real operational environments. The anticipated technical result is a unified software platform that will enable airports/airlines to be more efficient, while also balancing operational, societal, and environmental objectives in building a sustainable aviation system for the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is enabling increased throughput and quality in semiconductor, chemical and biochemical manufacturing. The ability to monitor pressure from atmosphere to ultra-high vacuum is a critical need for these industries. This need is currently addressed by using combinations of vacuum monitoring technologies that, in many cases, require the high cost of employing multiple devices for a single job, allowing for multiple failure modes, and increasing the space constraints on the manufacturing equipment.  Errors in accuracy in current systems can lead to lower production yields and failures due to exposure of fragile elements to atmospheric pressure can lead to higher maintenance costs and lower process availability. In this context, this new technology offers a substantial commercial benefit across several large-scale manufacturing industries.  This technology will be further leveraged for other large-scale verticals such as mass spectrometry and radiation detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will exploit ultrasensitive ion-sensing properties of low-power graphene sensors combined with voltage-controlled ion sources and resetting mechanisms for vacuum sensing. The core scientific breakthrough that underpins this technology is an ultrahigh intrinsic charge-to-current amplification mechanism inherently present in the graphene sensors.  This results in measurable changes in electrical conductance caused by the attachment of trace quantities of ions on the sensors. The nonlinear nature of the charge-to-current amplification scales to higher values at lower ion-flux rates, thereby allowing greater effective sensitivity at lower pressures.  In addition, combining these sensors with voltage-tunable ion sources and appropriate resetting mechanisms enables stable, long-term operation over a wide range of operating vacuum pressure.  Manufacturing sensors at the chip scale allows for multi-sensor readout for improved signal and reproducible behavior, along with resilience against failure. Taken together, these technological innovations will allow the development of high-performance vacuum gauges for diverse applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients? quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make laparoscopic and robotic assisted abdominal surgery safer for patients, and less costly for the healthcare system.  Though a somewhat rare complication, inadvertent bowel injury during the more than 15 million laparoscopic procedures performed annually can be catastrophic for patients resulting in extended hospitalization, multiple corrective surgeries, lifelong medical complications, and, in more than 5% of cases, death.  In addition, the direct costs associated with this complication can be substantial including intensive care convalescence and the potential for litigation given the nature of damages suffered by patients. Intraoperative detection of bowel injuries during surgery provides a simple, yet elegant solution enabling immediate repair and avoidance of negative outcomes. This project?s commercial potential includes availability in more than 49,000 operating suites and an addressable market of $750 million per annum. The proposed innovation will significantly enhance patient safety, reduce costs associated of corrective care, and generate revenue from U.S. based manufacturing.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable intraoperative detection of bowel injuries by identifying gases typically sequestered to the interior of the gastrointestinal tract. To accomplish this, these target gases must be sufficiently differentiable from background gases and other agents typically present during laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Such background agents present a meaningful technical challenge in that they present the potential for false positive detection results. Characterization of all potentially present agents will be completed such that they can be sufficiently differentiated from target gastrointestinal gases. A high precision gas chromatography system and custom fabricated chamber replicating surgical conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity and gas flow rate will be used to precisely identify and distinguish all potentially present gases. Once all potentially cross-reactive gases are characterized, a combination of physical filtration and algorithmic signal processing will be used to ensure proper differentiation/recognition of gas species and avoidance of potential false positive results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20% and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776 million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, 11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain diabetic foot ulcers each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible, robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the prototype and scale up hardware production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development and adoption of next generation portable energy storage devices.  Lithium-ion batteries are the most common energy storage technology for a wide variety of applications. Most recently, they have been adopted by small to medium sized Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and electric vehicles (EV). The weight carrying capacity and flight/operating time and range of these UAS and EV are issues mainly dependent on battery components and materials.  With the proposed lithium-ion battery technology, high-capacity, lightweight, and advanced batteries may store significantly more energy without increasing their weight. The development and integration of the next generation battery technology may significantly increase the performance of battery powered vehicles and their adoption by society. This technology has the potential to have a drastic commercial impact in the UAS/drone industry; For example, with successful batteries, medicine, blood, and organs can be quickly delivered to remote locations on unmanned platforms. Utility workers may be able to identify pipeline leaks or transmission line damages in advance of an accident and packages may be delivered faster, with significantly less carbon footprint, along with myriad of other applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop high capacity, lightweight lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells with a novel carbon-based anode component. Existing LIBs still utilize graphite with additives as the primary anode material due to their ability to restore the charge and provide consistency in voltage. However, graphite's limited capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of long lasting, higher energy density (over 340 Wh/kg) LIBs. Graphite's internal structure limits sufficient lithium diffusion into interlayer spaces. This project offers a new class of higher energy density (over 500 Wh/kg) LIBs, with an innovative multilayer graphenic anode.  Replacing graphite with the multilayer graphenic anode offers a solution in overcoming the issue of the  limited capacity of the carbon anode. This patent-pending, commercially feasible, only carbon-based anode has the unique capability of an intense lithium (Li) intercalation within its networks. The large Li/electrolyte interface contributes enhanced charge-transfer kinetics, resulting in effective charge/discharge cycling throughout hundreds of cycles with over 1500 mAh/g specific capacity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to increase the quality of consumer products and services by scaling the data sharing economy. Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are ?messy" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with ?feature stores,? which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to close gaps in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) proficiency, improving participation and sustained achievement, particularly for historically underserved student populations. Learning science has validated that the mathematical sciences are processed experientially ? through seeing, moving, doing, perceiving ? but current educational solutions generally do not explore this learning modality.  This platform will utilize Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and advanced analytics to scale these best practice pedagogies for both students and teachers. The aim of this project is to actualize the vision of technology-assisted STEM learning and operationalize it across the US K-12 system to close long-standing barriers to access and proficiency at scale.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform offers a way to rapidly close significant learning gaps students are facing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate how multimodal and game-driven learning in IVR can be used to enhance math proficiencies and the ability to transfer mathematical knowledge across contexts.  Such abilities have so far eluded incumbent learning technologies and interventions for math. In particular, this research may culminate in an experiential solution for students to learn Algebra efficiently, effectively, and purposefully. Immersed in relevant real-world contexts, students will use tactile 3D tools, movement, and a research-based pedagogical framework to build lasting fluency with math concepts while solving high impact problems. The platform will leverage the latest advances in data analysis to personalize learning experiences based on individual behaviors, skills and goals. This solution provides teachers with real-time data on student thinking so they can closely monitor, identify, and support priority students while providing timely feedback during critical cognitive moments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce a fusion-based engine in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive. The ultimate system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy.  Since the system is small and has low radiation, it also has applications for manned space flight.  This new engine could enable more direct and shorter flights to other planets, which minimizes the exposure of astronauts to the radiation encountered in outer space.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue the companies research on using a harmonic well to produce fusion by particle kinetic energy, rather than general thermal energy. The proposed concept utilizes a new heat engine technique that always maintains the plasma distribution function in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the proposed fusion system, a plasma is created in a specially designed harmonic well and then induced to form into two counter-oscillating spinning rings. When the two rings collide at the center of the well, the particle velocities are high enough to cause fusion.   This phase of the project will increase the energetics of the device. The project will move up to deuterium, a fuel which is twice as heavy as hydrogen (the current fuel) and has a much larger cross-section for fusion. The proposed approach is expected to make the harmonic well sufficiently energetic to produce deuterium-on-deuterium fusion by increasing the natural oscillation frequency of the well to give ion collision speeds of about one million meters per second. The project expects to be able to detect the neutrons produced by the fusion, demonstrating aneutronic fusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is related to the underserved, emergent bilingual population in US school systems. In spite of their growing size (approximately 20 percent of the total US population), emergent bilinguals still do not have adequate support to succeed in academic settings and are often victims of a subtractive bilingualism process that favors the acquisition of English at the expense of the home language. The lack of adequate bilingual resources has led to a disproportionate misplacement of emergent bilinguals in special education as well as an increased drop-out rates in bilingual populations, in general, and Latino communities in particular. To address these problems, a recommendation system powered by machine-learning algorithms that will generate a personalized bundle of fun, bilingual literacy activities linked to a fully-automated bilingual assessment is proposed. The unique characteristic of this solution is that the personalized activities are generated automatically based on assessment results and activity performance. The goal of the activities is to develop the skills identified by the assessment as needing improvement, both in English and in the home language of the child.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the educational needs of the growing, school-age, emergent bilingual population (i.e. children in the school system whose home language is not English or only English), as well as the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic acumen for society as a whole. The main research objectives involve: a) designing game-like bilingual activities that can get the young child?s attention, b) developing age-appropriate and culturally-sensitive content for the bilingual activities, c) refining the speech recognizer to work well with children's speech in both Spanish and English, and d) implementing the latest trends in data-analysis and machine-learning technologies to develop a recommendation system that proposes personalized activities tailored to each child?s needs based on assessment results and activity performance. The research and development plan aims at developing an innovative product that stands out from existing solutions. The key differentiator features are: 1) its focus on bilingual children and its adaptability in accepting bilingual answers for the activities, 2) its capacity to help children develop speaking skills due to the integration of automatic measures of speech performance, and 3) its recommendation engine that suggests personalized bilingual activities for each student tailored to their specific needs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.  Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks, develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed decisions.

    The research and development activities include: (1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps. These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods, potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaska?s environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-makers.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants, including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over 85%.

    The proposed project turns supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling. Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new markets, such as wastewater treatment.  Recovery of compression energy during SCWO has been demonstrated previously.  This project's goals are to further optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours between major services.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in teaching K-12 and college students STEM concepts in the fun-filled context of designing, building, and programming machines and robots and preparing them for the future technology-driven jobs. This project seeks to make robotics education affordable, equitable, and inclusive for students at all grade levels. By taking a multi-disciplinary and cross-curricula approach, the product developed through this project engages students, especially women and minorities from diverse backgrounds, effectively in STEM disciplines and helps them make suitable career choices. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce and help fill the 2.5 million STEM jobs that are vacant according to the current US Department of Labor Statistics. The technological innovations emerging from this project would result in a computational tool for synthesis of robot motions, which can be used broadly in industrial automation and invention of machines and robots. The proposed design-driven educational robotics product has the potential to improve engagement with science and technology and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to bring together rigid body kinematics, machine learning, and engineering design to create a new product for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools, freshman college programs, and STEM camps. The leading commercially available educational robotic systems emphasize 1) instruction-driven prototyping of robot structures using many specialized parts, and 2) programming them without providing any intuition behind the design process or guidance to creating mechanism design concepts for the realization of the motion of the robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, new science standards, and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This product would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. If successful, this project would result in a state-of-the-art motion design software, a novel hardware kit, and standards-aligned curriculum and learning resources for schools and colleges. The software based on the machine learning in mechanism design research will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide students necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.

    The proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail items moving in and out of buildings.  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  This project will address these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The effort is focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase its effectiveness.  If successful, the project will address critical public health and safety challenges.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset.  No commercially viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One challenge is the detection of liquid or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame ? such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device.  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.

    \ roads and bridges because the damage to a road surface increases substantially\
    \ with the relative load, e.g., the road damage caused by an 80,000-pound truck\
    \ is thousands of times that of a car which is twenty times lighter than the truck.\
    \  Any efforts to renovate or build new infrastructures will be hindered without\
    \ addressing this issue broadly.  Nearly 71% of U.S freight ? representing $700.3\
    \ billion in economic activity in 2017 ? moves via trucks.  Also, overweight trucks\
    \ are a significant safety risk. Being overweight reduces the maneuverability\
    \ of the massive vehicle and causes the truck's mechanical components to be prone\
    \ to failure, which in turn often causes crashes, with significant human and economic\
    \ tolls, especially if the load is hazardous. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this\
    \ project is to effectively and reliably measure the weight of a vehicle and consistently\
    \ detect overweight trucks without interfering with the traffic flow or the integrity\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable advanced 3D printing materials to solve challenges in emerging electronic devices, transportation technologies, heating and cooling system for buildings, and in thermal management in manufacturing processes. Overheating is a major challenge as electrical devices continue to grow more compact and energy dense. Heat exchangers manufactured through traditional methods are often expensive and energy intensive to fabricate and suffer from corrosion, limited performance, and high maintenance costs. Traditional mold tools machined from metals are often expensive, require long lead times, and have limited design freedom. To address these challenges, this project will develop a platform of novel high thermal conductivity composite materials that can be used to 3D print parts that enhance electronics cooling and performance while also reducing the product weight and cost, can improve heat exchanger performance while also reducing corrosion, fouling and associated maintenance, and can also be used to 3D print low cost and high-performance molds with low-cost capital and short lead times. The project will result in an advanced materials platform for engineers to create parts with metal-like thermal conductivity, but with the speed, low cost, and ultimate design freedom of printing plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develops 3D printable, plastic composite materials with 500x higher thermal conductivity than standard plastics. The unique materials incorporate continuous wires and fibers in 3D printing filaments to achieve thermal conductivity values not possible in traditionally manufactured composite parts.  The polymer composite shell and wire/fiber core can be tailored to offer high strength, high temperature stability, and even joule heating. These materials are printed directly on commercially available and low-cost Independent Dual Extrusion (IDEX) 3D printers using a modified hardware and software platform. Printing and filament production will be accomplished through the following five objectives: 1) finalize filament formulations for the desired material properties, 2) establish a pilot scale filament manufacturing line to demonstrate production scalability, 3) complete minor 3D printer hardware modifications to accommodate filament printing, 4) develop software to print and optimize parts for desired properties, and 5) print application examples and validate product performance with commercially relevant demonstrations.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve personnel safety from flammable gas leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential facilities. Additionally, the technology contributes to combating climate change by tackling one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.  The technology enables the mitigation of methane and refrigerant leaks that constitutes a significant market opportunity in the oil, gas and HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) markets. The innovation may solve important technical bottlenecks that have prevented widespread adoption of pervasive gas sensing in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As an enabling system, it may be utilized in a variety of other applications area such as the detection of explosives, narcotics, chemical weapons, indoor air quality monitoring, and diagnosis of disease via breath analysis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a gas sensor with an unparalleled combination of size, power, and cost while offering high detection performance. The proposed architecture fabricates high-frequency bulk acoustic resonators directly on the backend of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) integrated circuit chips which permits low-cost, mass-production and improved noise characteristics of the sensors. The direct co-integration also allows the fabrication of a receptor array to obtain responses from multiple target analytes that can be used to classify materials and for real-time calibration against environmental confounders. The objective of this project is the development of a single-chip gas sensor based on co-integrated piezoelectric materials. This effort will consist of the design, fabrication and characterization of integrated resonator arrays onto silicon circuits; integration of the chips with receptor materials, allowing selective adsorption of target gas molecules; and testing to assess the gas sensing performance.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the optics and lenses used in near infrared 3D imaging.  Glass lenses, which have excellent transmittance and thermal properties, are used in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and rangefinders for distances beyond a few tens of meters.  Polymer lenses, which are moldable and lower cost, are typically used in consumer-mobile 3D cameras and emerging automotive LiDAR systems.  The refractive indices of these lenses limit the numerical aperture and require longer-than-desired lens barrels.  The proposed polymeric chalcogenide lenses combine infrared transmittance, index, and thermal properties with the cost and moldability of optical polymers.  The innovation enables the molding of freeform polymer lenses with increased numerical aperture and reduced barrel lengths.  These properties make possible more compact, lighter, and lower cost 3D imagers.  With these advantages, rangefinders can be more easily carried and scan faster and smartphone cameras can have wider viewing angles.  Additionally, LiDAR systems can image more accurately around a vehicle and improve both driver and pedestrian safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance sulfur polymer chemistry and materials processing for the development of a new class of near infrared (NIR) optical components.  Innovative chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering has led to the development of a new class of optical polymers with the potential for imaging applications in the NIR.  As a result of extensive optical and mechanical characterization, including the determination of the optical constants over the full infrared spectrum, measurement of mechanical properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, measurement of thermo-optic coefficients, and determination of stress-optic coefficients, the materials will now be developed and integrated for product applications with innovative optical designs based on material's unique property set.  Freeform optical design concepts will be used which, to date, have not often been used in infrared imaging.  Such designs may lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for infrared imaging applications, further leveraging the advantages of the material's transmission spectrum, incorporating absorption, bulk scattering and surface scattering, and surface scattering contributions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help patients with cardiorespiratory conditions, including sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia. The project will develop a wearable sensor platform to simultaneously diagnose and monitor conditions. Multiple physiological measurements are collected by a comfortable, wireless sensor patch, resulting in a convenient remote monitoring clinical framework. Interfacing sensor data with an efficient cloud-based provider portal and automated algorithms will enable rapid screening of the 24 million undiagnosed sleep apnea patients in the United States. The proposed innovation will also provide insight into the practical clinical benefits and efficiencies to be gained by bundling multiple comorbid or otherwise related diagnostic pathways into a single workflow, such as reducing time to treatment for comorbid atrial fibrillation. This remote monitoring bundle concept represents the only all-in-one device capable of servicing multiple highly pervasive health challenges in a method unobtrusive and user-friendly for both the patient and the provider - particularly for telemedicine applications made more urgent by the global pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a simple, accurate, cloud-connected wearable patch and collect clinical comparison data to develop automated, low-power algorithms to simultaneously detect sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, and cardiac arrhythmias. The project integrates materials science, mechanical engineering, and signal processing approaches to detect critical physiological signals from the torso, including oxygen saturation and several hemodynamic metrics. The project will also conduct studies that offer early insights into the clinical benefits of bundled workflows across cardiac and sleep medicine specialties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the enablement of verifiable and confidential computing through research and development that improves the performance and cost of the underlying cryptographic computations. Digital services play a foundational role in varied sectors including communication, education, banking, and others. Without cryptography these services would be impossible to conduct online in a secure and private manner. However, many new and more powerful cryptographic techniques remain out of reach due to their computationally expensive nature. Reducing the cost of these operations enables not just secure communication, but also verifiable and confidential computation, of rapidly growing interest to both the enterprise and government segments for use cases such as privacy-preserving machine learning. The market for verifiable and confidential computing solutions is expected to grow to over one billion dollars in the next five years.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and develop a high performance cloud-based system for verifiable and confidential computing. Currently many verifiable and confidential computing techniques can not be brought into production due to their computationally expensive nature. This project performs algorithmic research, hardware design, and software development, that will improve the performance and cost of these operations. In particular, this project optimizes cryptographic algorithms to make them more amenable to GPU-based processing, optimize the software implementation of those algorithms to target GPU architectures, devise methods for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and develop a scale-out architecture that dynamically scales capacity as the complexity of uses and number of users grow. With the appropriate design, the project expects to develop a system with over an order of magnitude or more performance than existing designs. Furthermore, by creating a ?cloud-based? infrastructure, these resources can be made available to developers around the world, with low latency and low cost. The expected improvements in performance, cost, and access will enable new use cases that have previously been impractical.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and networking.  Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers.  The proposed project enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum dot based multiwavelength laser sources.  Multiwavelength lasers with adequate output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion.  The designs and materials platform developed in this project address these challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project based on this SBIR sensor solution, with its high quality and low cost, will enable the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) industry to accelerate the progress to greater functionality of assisted driving, ultimately reaching full autonomy. The subject focal plane array (FPAS) chips may reduce the current US 36,560 annual vehicles deaths (the leading cause of death for those 1-54 years old) as well as reduce the 4.4 million injuries requiring medical attention and the $ 871 billion in damages and health costs. Additionally, improved assisted driving will enhance the mobility of seniors/disabled. Finally, the technology may reduce the societal carbon footprint by reducing congestion as a result of more fuel-efficient acceleration and braking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve the current ADAS sensor suite to increase safety. Current ADAS systems require many different sensor technologies to be implemented simultaneously. These sensors are insufficient to achieve higher levels of autonomy limiting the vehicle?s used in poor conditions. The proposed sensor solution will function in low light and harsh weather conditions with high performance. The added sensor functionalities will reduce the processor bandwidth required to integrate and analyze sensor data and detect road hazards, increasing the accuracy of the system. Overall, this improvement in performance may increase the overall safety in ADAS vehicles. An evaluation system will be developed to characterize the sensor.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve care for pulmonary conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This disease affects 30 million Americans, kills more than 150,000 a year and is the third leading cause of U.S. deaths. COPD costs Americans nearly $72 billion a year, half of which is spent on ER visits and hospital stays resulting from respiratory crises. Hospitalized COPD patients have reduced quality of life, more rapid lung disease progression, and a 50% increase in mortality in the subsequent two years. Currently, ongoing monitoring of COPD lung deterioration relies largely on patient-reported symptoms and inadequate tools (65-70% accurate). As a result, half of COPD deterioration remains undetected. The proposed technology facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of COPD attacks by continuous remote tracking of lung function, thereby preventing unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. This device improves care for long-term conditions like COPD or asthma, but also those with relatively quick onset, such as COVID-19.

    The proposed project advances translation of a device using acoustic resonance to measure lung air volume. The project develops an expanded data set for analysis and deployment at scale. The project further incorporates advanced classification models into the analysis workflow to track and predict deteriorating lung function in a cloud-computing environment. The project will also develop a version to run on a patient's mobile device to enable real-time feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will be to address the customized needs of automotive applications with tailored high performance-low cost carbon fiber (HP-LCCF) products that are not currently commercially available. The broader impact of HP-LCCF technology is to enable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies to help mitigate the climate change linked emissions caused by fossil fuel powered vehicles.  Volume projections of HP-LCCF for this application are expected to ramp up significantly over the ten years.  After successful entry into the automotive market, the focus will be expanded to address needs in the wind energy market and with a tailored HP-LCCF product to enable longer blades for larger and more efficient wind turbines.  This technology will help spur global adoption of clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a process where heavy tow carbon fiber is subdivided using an electromechanical splitting process that can maintain an acceptable range of regular tow carbon fiber linear densities.  Subsequent tailoring trials will verify the capability to achieve and maintain the linear density targets provided by the automotive industry partners who will, in turn, perform downstream manufacturability trials.  Subdividing the heavy tows enables a seamless commercial entry into customers' downstream composite manufacturing processes without an inherent, potentially fatal heavy tow defect.  Such defects are typically non-uniform intra-band tension caused by the transverse catenary forces across the tow band.  Achieving high band linear density and variable intra-band tension are significant barriers for the commercial adoption of heavy tow high performance, low cost carbon fibers (HP-LCCF).  The process developed here may eliminate such issues and achieve commercially relevant HP-LCCF.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However, operating in today?s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application.  This project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively.  The technology represents a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete colonoscopies.  The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective, manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure realm.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel genetic trait that allows plants to rapidly respond to attacking pathogens. Despite modern agricultural practices and chemistry improvements, almost 40% of all crop production is lost due to pests and pathogens each year; within the U.S. over 25% of soybean production is lost this way. These losses are even more severe in regions where pesticide application is prohibitively expensive for farmers.  This project develops a new technology for use in soybean and other oilseed crops to protect against plant disease.

    The proposed project will develop a broad-spectrum pathogen resistance trait.  While the first generation of transgenic trait technologies conferring herbicide tolerance and insecticidal traits have been readily established for oilseed production across North and South America, further development has faltered due to the complexity of these plant traits. Unfortunately, the proteins that provide the best tolerance to adverse environmental conditions also result in toxic side-effects when produced in healthy plants; consequently, the utility of developing these proteins is limited. Current methods for regulating expression of resistance proteins introduced into plants through genetic engineering are insufficient to regulate toxic proteins/compounds that may have side-effects in other environmental conditions. The proposed project will demonstrate an expression system that responds to signals, common to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, in the early and late stages of the plant immune response to release the production of anti-microbial proteins only in when needed, effectively eliminating the off-target side-effects. The project objectives are to 1) perform field and greenhouse trial of soybean with this technology to ascertain extent of pathogen resistance and yield effects in infected and healthy conditions; 2) optimize the technology for tissue specific (i.e., roots vs. leaves) use in soybean; 3) conduct greenhouse experiments to determine response to pathogen detection in canola, cotton, and potato as candidates for future field trials and commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need special probes or dyes to detect viruses.

    The proposed project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images from the common 96-well plate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an oral delivery platform that can deliver various drugs to the gastrointestinal tract. The market for novel biologics and oral formulations of currently injectable biologics is increasing rapidly, as is the market for gene therapies, necessitating a versatile oral drug delivery platform. This platform would positively impact society by reducing the need for repeated injections. This system would improve ease of administration of injectables by improving oral availability and the transport to the intestinal cells, and subsequent secretion of the protein into the bloodstream. This would also allow for local delivery of therapeutics for intestinal diseases which currently are hampered by poor mucus penetration and represent a multibillion-dollar market. Successful translation of this technology would benefit pharmaceutical companies, patients, and payers by providing an oral delivery platform for a broad range of therapeutics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of improving systemic expression of a protein from the gastrointestinal tract following oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The role of digestive tract is to breakdown lipids and nucleic acids and it has therefore been very challenging to for gene delivery vehicles to survive and deliver cargo to the intestine. The project advances a new lipid nanoparticle system able to protect the genetic cargo to generate protein expression in intestinal cells later secreted into the bloodstream for systemic circulation. This process converts previously injected protein drugs into an easily administered oral drug. The research objectives are to screen and optimize several of the lipid components as well as the nucleic acid to improve secreted expression of a protein into the blood after oral delivery. This research will screen multiple formulations and cargos in vivo and measure serum protein levels after oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The anticipated technical results are that the level of secreted protein will improve 10x from the initial formulation, further increasing the scope of potential therapeutic targets for the oral lipid nanoparticle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of blood clotting and associated bleeding risks in neonatal and pediatric patients as well as vulnerable adult patients. Existing systems put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. Using only a single drop of blood, the proposed non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting for all patients and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by more than 3x. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $1.1 billion annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood. The basis of the technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation. Due to its non-contact feature and low sample volume requirement, this technology can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The goal of this project is to develop and test a system for fast, reliable, and easy-to-use drop-of-blood coagulation analysis under sterile conditions. This goal will be achieved by meeting four objectives: 1) develop the module for automatic sample deployment from standard blood collection tubes; 2) implement environmental control and sample containment (?acoustic cartridge?); 3) assemble prototype devices and develop the control software with improved workflow and a user-friendly interface; and 4) assess prototype reliability, standardize it for coagulation measurements, and conduct initial clinical testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to reduce the risk of complications and associated costs caused by standard bag valve mask (BVM) resuscitators, which are widely used in emergency resuscitation and airway management. In the United States, about 13.1 million BVMs are used annually. Medical providers frequently deliver unsafe manual ventilation with BVMs, regardless of the qualifications and experience of the provider. Dangerously high pressures, flow rates, and volumes of air flow can result in complications such as gastric insufflation, and less frequently, aspiration pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, barotrauma, volutrauma, and pneumothorax. There is an urgent need for an intervention to improve patient safety during manual ventilation with the resuscitator bag. This project involves the development of a safety device to be used with all standard BVMs on the market to regulate air flow and pressure. The device that will offer safe, affordable, and optimized ventilation while minimizing gastric insufflation.  The technology should have broad applications across the entire care continuum, but especially in emergency and battlefield medicine.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project seeks to further develop and optimize the BVM safety. This effort optimizes the haptic and auditory feedback the provider receives when using the device and optimizes the design and manufacturability of the product. In addition, biocompatibility studies and animal studies of the device in anesthetized pigs and in pigs undergoing cardiac arrest will provide data necessary for FDA clearance. This Phase II work will ensure that patients will receive the most optimal evidence-based treatment and will help establish the safety device as the standard of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy using a novel and proprietary precision gene editing technology. The proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of gene editing by optimizing the precision of editing to correct the disease. This technology can be used to improve and even cure patients of genetic disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using a novel and proprietary CRISPR-Cas precision gene editing system. Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases. However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies. This project will develop an engineered anti-CRISPR (ErAcr) protein to eliminate unintended off-target editing. The ErAcr protein will be paired with a novel CRISPR-Cas nuclease and developed into a therapy for SMA> The therapy will be packaged into an adeno-associated viral vector and tested for editing and SMA disease correction in patient-derived cells and in an SMA mouse model. Effective editing will lead to disease correction in both patient cells and mice with no observable off-target editing events.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance clinical outcomes for patients with a traumatic or palliative peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In the U.S., 20 million people suffer from PNIs, with a high prevalence among young individuals and a total economic cost to society in excess of $150 billion per year. Acute PNIs account for more than 500,000 annual surgical procedures in the U.S and frequently result in permanent disability. This project develops a platform technology with the potential to address many types of PNI.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a novel nerve graft/conduit for nerve gap injury repair and a nerve cap.  The project goal is to advance a solution to improve the nerve functional outcome while still reducing the tension across the repair.  It provides a tissue-like matrix that allows aligned nerve growth out of the free nerve ending. The technology is derived from decellularized porcine nerve tissue and maintains native structural and functional proteins, providing an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration. This project conducts in-vivo studies, sterilization demonstrations, and lyophilization. Supply chain security, packaging development, and tooling will be developed in preparation for commercial launch.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide environmentally friendly, self-cleaning coating technologies. Fluorinated materials, known as forever materials, have been widely used due to their excellent self-cleaning properties, but the detrimental environmental impacts resulting from these coatings motivate the introduction of environmentally friendly solutions. This project plans to create a new technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties, and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g., excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion) while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and 3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the technology into  relevant applications. The anticipated results include successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace, to name a few.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is utilizing thermal energy management to simultaneously improve the affordability, comfort, and safety of buildings, with an initial focus on meeting urgent market demand for non-combustible building insulation.  This project will focus on developing a lightweight, easy-to-install, non-combustible insulation product which is also eco-friendly and non-toxic.  Structure fires represent 37% of all fires in the US. These fires caused $12.3 billion in property damage and 80% of civilian fire deaths.  Wildfires in the Western US, where >$220 billion in residential construction is in ?extreme? wildfire-prone areas, add to the urgency of this situation.  Mineral wool is the only non-combustible insulation product available today but requires personal protective equipment for installation and was recently classified as carcinogenic.  Fully non-combustible building insulation is a high growth market, and the broader market for all types of non-flammable insulation represents a significant opportunity.  This Phase II project seeks to cost-effectively increase the supply of energy-efficient, non-combustible buildings for both new and retrofit construction, while also addressing high-temperature industrial markets which have the most intensive energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up a novel nanocomposite insulation product using a proprietary foaming process for inorganic aerogel-based insulation that minimizes shrinkage (thus maximizing porosity for insulation performance and minimizing material and processing cost). This approach leverages readily available materials such as clay and silica, as well as potentially renewable cellulose biomass, to produce an environmentally friendly, high performance insulation product for non-combustible buildings which is easy to install, lightweight, and non-toxic.  Successfully scaling this approach on existing manufacturing equipment may solve a significant materials research challenge, creating organic-inorganic nanocomposites for thermal insulation with a competitive cost / performance ratio versus incumbent products such as fiberglass, mineral wool, and plastic foams.  The Phase II project may result in the first industrially-engineered composite material for thermal insulation which is fully non-combustible.  The integration of flexible polymers and radiation blocking additives would also enable use for high-temperature industrial pipe insulation, a critical energy-saving application where most existing products have significant limitations due to radiation loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  II project is to improve disease research and drug discovery. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most impactful and vital tools of biological structure analysis today.  The proposed project improves the current methods to achieve better accuracy and productivity, with faster user training.

    The proposed project improves imaging by cryo-EM. The images currently generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy and thus requires extensive processing to build recognizable structures (proteins and others). Single-particle cryo-EM is a method that produces images of individual particles and can potentially analyze biological structures at the single-molecule level.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques to mitigate the issues.  AI/ML algorithms can automate the workflow, facilitating quality data and the development of 3D models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to open the path for resource extraction on the Moon, creating an in-space manufacturing industry, allowing for a permanent presence on the Moon, and expanding the ability to explore the inner planets of the solar system. The technology may result in the ability of humans to operate and live in space: building state-of-the-art research infrastructure, exploring the solar system, creating a space economy independent of Earth, and moving terrestrial manufacturing and power generation into space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may provide new insights into electrorefining metal oxide feedstocks, specifically lunar regolith simulants, through high-temperature electrolysis to yield oxygen and metals. Additionally, the proposed technology will address anode stability and advance studies in novel platinum group metal anodes. The team will use multi-physics modeling for high-temperature electrolysis and for modeling low gravity and lunar vacuum environments. The project may result in the ability to extract oxygen and raw metals from lunar regoliths advancing research in space resource extraction efforts. This advancement in knowledge may aide in the research and development efforts in the fields of materials science, inorganic chemistry, and metallurgy which could result in the carbon-free production of steel and other metals on Earth, new anode materials for high-temperature electrolysis, new electrochemical processes for electrorefining raw feedstocks, and the ability to source oxygen and metals from the Moon and other planetary bodies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the current lack of useful, realistic feedback in commercially available bionic prosthetic devices. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide closed loop control through sensory feedback. Without this type feedback, prosthesis users tend to avoid manipulating certain objects because they run the risk of handling them incorrectly or destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research seeks to develop a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. The expected outcomes of this research are: a controller that can regulate both intensity and quality sensation and a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for day-to-day manipulation tasks. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million upper limb amputees worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enhance a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator, by integrating a control system that will be able to regulate both intensity and quality of sensation. The design and controller of this stimulator are unique.  The stimulator will integrate existing prosthetic hand systems. The sensation controller will modulate stimulation parameters to compensate for changes in measured resistance between the electrode-skin interface, thus reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The sensation controller will also maintain a consistent quality of sensation throughout usage. Upon completion of the Phase II project, the prosthetic technology will be a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to commercialize a novel technology that enables compact, efficient, silent, reliable, and fuel-flexible power generation. Existing power solutions can lack endurance, reliability, and portability and often generate harmful emissions; or they are prohibitively expensive or incompatible with existing fuels and distribution infrastructure.  The power generation platform developed in this project has the potential to be a key enabling technology for the future rapid growth of commercial drone applications, which currently are often limited by the performance of lithium ion batteries. Drones are expected to make an impact across numerous industries including transport and delivery, power and utilities, telecommunications, and remote sensing. Additionally, this power generation technology can benefit industrial internet of things applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel power source that is easily portable and is compatible with existing fuel infrastructure. This project develops a system that converts most fuels to electricity via light; combustion heats a nanophotonic material to incandescence and the resulting light drives photovoltaic cells. The nanophotonic material is engineered to be spectrally matched to the photovoltaic cells, enabling efficient conversion. This technology can increase the endurance of drones or other systems up to ten times over batteries alone. This work is focused on cost reduction through new material development. The specific research objectives are to demonstrate a low-cost and scalable process for the nanophotonic material and photovoltaic cell while maintaining high performance, and then integrate and pilot the low cost system. Successful completion of these objectives will enable this technology to translate to drone applications with a compelling need for long-lasting portable power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a scalable carbon nanotube (CNT) production process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of the production process. This project will support domestic supply chains for CNT materials at potentially disruptively low cost-levels. There is market need for low cost CNTs to companies where replacement of existing additives with CNTs can lead to improved products at equivalent or lower cost. Two examples of this are in battery additives or tire additives, where CNTs can replace lower quality carbon black materials to break traditional materials trade-offs such as energy vs power density (batteries) or fuel efficiency vs lifetime (tires).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, sustainable electrochemical Carbon Nanotube (CNT) production technology, which uses CO2 and electricity to produce high quality CNT products that meet and exceed the quality metrics of today's market products, while feasibly offering a disruptively lower priced CNT product.  This project leverages experience in electrochemistry and carbon nanomaterials synthesis to develop rapidly scalable electrode architectures and preparation processes to fabricate such electrode architectures that enable the production of CNTs at cost structures that are truly disruptive in the marketplace and enable rapid commercialization.  To further complement these technical efforts, this project optimizes post-growth CNT processing to better align products for customer integration and utilization.  Finally, this work will demonstrate the commercial viability of the approach and a scaling pathway for the materials platform.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable wider adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across industries such as real estate, agriculture, construction, energy, entertainment, oil & gas, and journalism.  The project develops advanced UAV camera systems with seamless 360-degree imaging capabilities to increase flight time and the imaging capability. End users benefit from reduced labor demands and real-time high-fidelity images of remote areas otherwise inaccessible. Industrial inspections, crop management, field surveying, and site security are most often conducted by deploying humans into the field - often creating labor bottlenecks and potentially dangerous situations. Adoption of UAVs for these applications can be limited by image processing that consumes too much power for UAV use, delayed image presentation affecting navigation capabilities, or image artifacts that obscure the details pertinent to market needs.  These limitations can all be overcome with the camera technologies developed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a lightweight, parallax-free, 360-degree panoramic camera system with an innovative optical design based on a polyhedron-shaped configuration of adjacent cameras. Each camera's field of view closely abuts but does not overlap with the next, enabling seamless and computationally simplistic capture of images from 360-degree views, while limiting blind regions and lost content between cameras. This approach eliminates the stitching errors and image distortion associated with wide angle lenses and multi-camera systems, and reduces the computational demand for 360-degree image capture. As a result, low energy edge-computing presents images in real time with minimal impact on flight time or energy use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications. Furthermore, this project advances system designs optimized for UAV weight and size, as well as improved concepts for kinematic space frames, in which the cameras can be integrated to form robust multi-camera systems.

Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.  This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of an aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery that is a replacement for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries in stationary energy storage applications.  This battery has a nonflammable, environmentally-friendly, water-based electrolyte and does not utilize cobalt or nickel, reducing reliance on critical materials and helping to diversify battery material supply chains.  The battery chemistry combines the high safety and low cost associated with zinc-based batteries with the long life of lithium-ion batteries.  This aqueous battery may help to advance the adoption of beneficial energy technologies such as intermittent renewables and electric vehicles.  The battery utilizes zinc that can be sourced domestically and does not introduce a dependency on foreign sources, promoting both national security and the creation of US-based jobs.  The battery is also fully recyclable using existing methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery technology by focusing on optimization of individual battery components to improve cycle life and power as well as scale up from pouch cells to larger-format prismatic cells.  The research will include refining the intercalation electrode design to increase capacity retention during long life cycling, developing the zinc electrode design to suppress zinc dendrite growth, improving separator functionality to maintain high-rate capabilities and increase cycle life, and developing an electrolyte designed to stabilize zinc while also allowing for faster reactivity with the zinc and lithium ions.  Larger format cells with optimized components will be built and tested to evaluate scaled real-world performance metrics compared to Lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries traditionally used in stationary energy storage applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance energy sustainability, especially regarding estimation, understanding, and optimization of real-time grid carbon emissions. Decarbonizing the grid means reducing its carbon emissions by decreasing the emissions per unit of electricity generated. In-depth, accurate knowledge of real-time grid emissions will facilitate various grid decarbonization use cases and applications ranging from corporate carbon accounting, carbon-aware energy management, and new emission tracking standards to future electricity and carbon market design. More broadly, the prposed platform may demonstrate that achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reductions via co-optimization for costs and carbon is possible and provide a commercially viable, scalable path for policy makers, regulators, and corporations to meet their ambitious sustainability commitments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop novel and practical approaches to estimate, learn, and optimize real-time grid emissions. The Phase II project will optimize carbon estimation and forecast models, develop decision-making algorithms, implement the proposed methods as software, and validate the software platform through pilots. The team seeks to will build a user-friendly, cloud-based software platform with multiple applications that will enable climate regulators and sustainability directors to meet their public commitments and stay compliant with new regulations. Integrating real-time carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management is a critical challenge. Little is known about real-time carbon signals from the grid and the proposed project aims to demystify grid emissions to enable accurate, actionable, and transparent carbon tracking, reporting, and management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to more completely understand the real world through a perfect virtual copy. This SBIR Phase II project makes it possible to create virtual reproductions of real cities that not only show how the world looks, but reproduce every object and every detail perfectly, allowing users to interact with it. These virtual copies make it possible to quickly and effectively train soldiers and first responders, train autonomous ground and flying vehicles, place new construction into a dense city, simulate the effects of catastrophic weather, and explore imaginary scenarios through games. Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the introduction of non-flammable, easy-to-manufacture solid battery electrolytes that are also compatible with lithium metal. The cell architecture seeks to ensure safety while enabling a significant improvement in the energy density.  The teams also seeks to lower the costs of the lithium-ion batteries by eliminating extrinsic costs associated with thermal management and explosion containment.  Safe, easy-to-manufacture electrolytes may alter the rate of electrification of the global economy. The next generation of battery powered medical devices, a large proportion of which are manufactured in the United States, may also benefit from the adoption of the new solid electrolyte. In addition, the proposed composite solid electrolyte aims to enable new cell architectures with significantly higher energy densities than what has been possible in liquid electrolyte systems to date.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a non-flammable, high-conductivity composite, solid-state battery electrolytes that are compatible with mixed metal oxide cathode chemistries and cell manufacturing processes. The morphology of the composite electrolyte is such that it offsets disadvantages present in polymer electrolytes, as well as inorganic sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes, when they are used as monolithic materials. The unique heterostructures of the proposed solid electrolytes advance the current state-of-the-art by enabling faster diffusion of lithium ions through multiple pathways, while mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte's nonflammable nature makes it a potential replacement for conventional liquid electrolytes in reducing fire hazards and reducing the costs of reqired thermal protection systems in lithium-ion batteries. The compatibility with lithium metal presents a unique opportunity for improvement in the energy density over currently used silicon-graphite anodes, that translates to a lower cost per unit of stored energy ($/kWh). An additional advantage is that these batteries do not require special handling and they are compatible with both spiral wound and planar battery form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes providing a high-throughput system for recycling critical metals like cobalt to reduce the conventional energy-intensive mining and refining processes used to produce materials for manufacturing today. Most importantly, this project will help secure a supply of critical materials, reducing the United States? reliance on foreign supply chains and guaranteeing a secondary source of battery materials. A new, domestic supply will also reduce the social and human health impacts associated with artisanal mining, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to (1) validate novel electro-extraction nanotechnology based separations technology in the battery recycling and cobalt mining space, and (2) validate a new, value-added product (a battery cathode precursor material) for this rapidly growing market, rendering the conventional refining stages unnecessary.   The proposed electroextraction process utilizes flow-through water electrolysis to produce high local concentrations of hydroxide to precipitate transition metals as metal hydroxides.  This understanding will allow tuning the device operating conditions for metal or mixed-metal specific precipitation, for example, the precipitation of Ni-Mn-Co hydroxides at battery stoichiometries or highly selective precipitation of individual metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address fire and explosion safety hazards associated with lithium ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage technologies. Fueled by growth in the energy storage and electric vehicle industries, the Li-ion battery market is expected to grow to a size of several hundred billion dollars by 2025. Future viability of these clean energy technologies are dependent on Li-ion battery technology. However, Li-ion batteries occasionally catastrophically fail, posing thermal hazards as serious as fires and explosions.  The proposed technology has the potential to be an effective, low cost solution and accelerating adoption of transformative clean energy technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the safety of Li-ion bateries. Under certain scenarios, Li-ion batteries can fail, resulting in an exothermic release of flammable and toxic gases. For applications including large multi-cell battery systems in energy storage and vehicle use, the risk of thermal runaway can result in catastrophic fires, explosions and toxic gas release that can damage nearby infrastructure and cause injury or death. Thermal runaway poses significant challenges for available suppression and mitigation systems because the hazardous gas release can continue despite suppression of the incipient fire. The proposed thermal runaway protection and suppression technology addresses the source of the hazards by exploiting a series of novel physio-chemical processes to reduce flammable and toxic gas species concentrations released during a thermal runaway event.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will significantly lower the initial cost of residential and commercial ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems used in space heating and cooling applications. GSHPs are inherently more energy efficient than most heating and cooling technologies. This technology will accelerate electrification of the US economy, lessen the nation?s dependence on fossil fuels, reduce peak electricity demand, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. GSHPs operate quietly and reliably, provide humidity control, and can provide both heating and cooling, greatly increasing the comfort of building environments and quality of life. GSHPs can also reduce and levelize utility bills in low-income housing and enhance the ability to provide energy assistance programs to those in need.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further develop a novel technology that will overcome barriers in the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The project?s chief technical objectives are to improve tools and knowhow relating to the application of the proposed novel in-ground heat exchanger technology and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this technology in real-world applications in targeted geographical markets. Specifically, the project will further refine the computational modeling tools used to size heat exchanger systems; and develop and integrate sophisticated geospatial data sets that these models will use/ This will result in more accurate and more rapid heat exchanger sizing on a site-specific basis. Next, the project will validate these tools through extended testing and data collection on a prototype system installed on a home system. Finally, this project will apply these tools during the deployment of three commercial systems in targeted geographic markets and collect additional data regarding their performance over time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project improves inventory management.  An estimated $818 billion is lost annually due to incomplete knowledge of a company?s inventory.  The problem occurs because of the absence of a label at manufacturing that survives through the supply chain (retail, logistics, and end user). Currently, traditional supply chain management forces a company to add at least one new tag at each step. This project will reduce the number of tags per product, exponentially decrease waste, increase supply chain efficiency, and prevent knockoffs or counterfeits from being added to the supply chain. All of this will help businesses run more effectively, better serve customers, and enable consumers to gain detailed knowledge of their purchases.

    The intellectual merit of this project is development of the first commercially viable, cradle-to-grave inventory tag through optimization and scalability tasks. The innovation is a chipless inventory tag with a unique serial number for every product to provide the cradle-to-grave functionality. The underlying Material Adjusted Signature Tag (MAST) technology uses printable materials to create a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. The MAST tags will enable direct printing or application of a tag onto a product, allowing an efficient way to reliably identify, track, and attribute data to a product throughout its life. This project will improve the tag?s data potential, optimize manufacturability, and achieve greater readability. Beyond optimization and scalability milestones, this project will test the tags, readers, and manufacturing equipment in relevant environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of automatically refocusing reading glasses for wide adoption by the two billion people with presbyopia, a common form of vision loss with age that prevents focusing on nearby objects. Current presbyopia corrections, such as reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses, are unwieldy or unnatural solutions that fail to perfectly replace healthy vision. An automatically refocusing system will provide an attractive alternative by restoring natural vision, such that objects are brought into focus according to where the user looks. With a lightweight and robust implementation for all-day use, such a system will be poised for wide translation to address a ubiquitous cause of decreased productivity and quality of life for billions worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop key technologies leading to the miniaturization of the automatically refocusing glasses. Existing systems address only the highest performance implementations of full 3D gaze estimation for demanding applications like VR or AR, and they are too power-hungry and large for automatically refocusing reading glasses. This project will develop a customized hardware and software system for novel depth-estimation specific to this application. The project will explore the trade space of weight, power consumption, and form factor to develop an optimal parameter set.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance a novel, reusable, intermittent, urinary catheterization system from a functional prototype to the final production-equivalent device. By progressing the system through additional design improvements and FDA submission, the goal of this project is to enable the product to reach the hands of individuals who require intermittent catheters to urinate. Current intermittent urinary catheter use is fraught with complications including frequent urinary tract infections, expensive supplies, and large material footprints, as well as the generation of a significant amount of plastic waste. This project seeks to improve the current catheter landscape by allowing for commercialization of a reusable catheter system that will reduce contact contamination during insertion, reduce plastic waste, and enable widespread use of high-quality urinary catheters by decreasing the per-use cost. Through these improvements, healthcare costs associated with intermittent catheterization can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, based on frequent interactions with individuals who catheterize and suffer from impaired dexterity, the design of the system will incorporate the needs and ideas of people who are often ignored during innovation within the current catheterization space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will finalize the design of a novel, reusable, intermittent urinary catheterization system and portable reprocessing device as well as advance the system towards commercialization. Intermittent urinary catheterization is a technologically static field that has not changed significantly since the 1970s, with minimal improvements in urinary tract infection risk, supply cost, and environmental waste reduction. While the associated SBIR Phase I project established proof-of-concept catheter reprocessing, the Phase II project will include optimization and more advanced microbiologic efficacy testing. This assessment will focus on specifically addressing concerns regarding lubrication and compactness brought up during SBIR Phase I customer discovery activities, as well as multiple reuse reprocessing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase access to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Over 554,000 kidney failure patients in the US require some form of dialysis each year but only 58,000 receive PD, despite its lower cost of care. Despite the many benefits and advantages of PD compared to in-center dialysis, adoption is limited due to the risk of peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneal membrane. Peritonitis occurs in nearly 30% of PD patients each year and is responsible for the death of 1 out of every 6 patients who receive PD. The proposed device significantly and broadly reduces the risk of peritonitis, resulting in nearly $2 billion in Medicare savings and improved clinical outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop a medical device that internally disinfects catheter tubes in a closed system. This innovative disinfection method is designed to prevent microbial infection threats during peritoneal dialysis. The aim will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disinfection prototype, including evaluations of its ease of use. The technology will be designed to meet medical device design and safety standards. The project will perform optimization studies, develop cGMP-ready manufacturing processes, and develop an advanced prototype.

This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time ? a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and commercialize an ocular gene therapy to reverse the effects of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting over 11 million Americans today and representing the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the United States. The proposed treatment has the potential to preserve independence, economic stability, and quality of life of those affected by AMD and reduce US healthcare costs with just a single treatment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project technical plan will optimize the formulation, dose, and route of administration of an investigational therapy in a large animal model. The project will first develop gene therapy formulations with various vehicles. The formulations? efficiency in retinal tissues with an injection into the eye will be assessed with preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses. Toxicology studies will be performed to assess safety and efficacy of the novel formulation and the injection route at various doses over 3 months. Subsequently, the project will assess risk in manufacturing the gene delivery vehicles to ensure that high concentrations can be manufactured for future clinical use.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in transforming a ubiquitous source of water pollution into a renewable source of fertilizer, while facilitating onsite treatment and reuse of recycled greywater. This technological solution is intended to conserve precious drinking water supplies and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources for both wastewater treatment and fertilizer production. Rather than combining all domestic wastewater into one dilute stream, this project separates and recycles the largest source of nutrient pollution: toilet waste. Source-separating bathroom fixtures (including waterless urinals, urine-diverting toilets, and vacuum-flush toilets) direct the waste through dedicated plumbing to a compact building-scale processor, which converts it into a purified liquid fertilizer. This technology may have immediate utility in sensitive watersheds where regulations require landowners to remove nitrogen from wastewater, and in urban settings where municipalities are subsidizing or mandating distributed wastewater treatment because their central wastewater treatment facilities have reached or exceeded their design capacity. The technology may create jobs in installation and service, reduce loads on wastewater treatment plants, restore waterways, and yield clean, domestically-produced fertilizer for use in agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on developing a building-scale, high-strength, wastewater treatment system paired with source-separating bathroom fixtures to result in a resource recovery system. Nutrients are recovered from the influent wastewater through a four-stage treatment train that includes: (1) acidification to minimize pipe occlusion, (2) freeze concentration to reduce volume, (3) pasteurization to destroy pathogens, and (4) filtration to reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. The objective of this research project is to develop this technology to the point where it can be installed in a building and is capable of capturing greater than 90% of nutrients from 600 liters of wastewater per day with minimal energy inputs. This goal will require increasing the working volume of the current freeze concentrator, optimizing the energy usage of each element in the treatment train, packaging each element so that they are durable, readily installable, and easily maintained, and developing a fully automated control system. Each element of the treatment train will be tested individually to demonstrate that a consistent, concentrated, sanitized fertilizer can be produced from high-strength wastewater while decreasing building water demand.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for a healthy, sustainable built environment. Stringent environmental protection policies are presenting the building industry with challenges in reducing environmental impacts. High performing windows could play an role in reducing energy use and pollutant emissions. Creating a window system that reduces building energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may have broad societal, economic, and commercial impacts. The proposed biochromic windows can serve as an alternative, energy efficient retrofit and help meet net zero energy, net zero carbon buildings. Their multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits include high energy efficiency, improved air quality, carbon capture, and renewable energy production. Energy efficient window retrofitting accounts for over 60% of the global window market share. In 2021, the global window market grew to $10 billion for replacement and renovation and $6 billion for new construction with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. This energy efficient, carbon sink technology may result in 20~30% energy savings and carbon reductions. The good air quality further benefits occupant health and well-being, making the building more appealing to occupants, industry professionals, and stakeholders.

    The key technical innovation of the biochromic window is to integrate biological cells within a window assembly for commercial building retrofitting applications. As a primary building enclosure system mediating between indoor and outdoor environments, the biochromic window offers improved insulation, dynamic shading efficacy, daylight penetration, views to outside, carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation, and biomass production, all of which are attributes of improved building energy efficiency, good indoor air quality, beneficial carbon sequestration, novel biofuel production, and user satisfaction. The primary project objectives are to: 1) prototype of a biochromic window, integrated with an intelligent control system to enable the maximum performance; 2) conduct performance testing and obtain performance certificates; and 3) scale-up mass production manufacturing and carry out technology demonstrations at early adopter?s buildings. Project outcomes seek to save building energy consumption in heating, cooling, and artificial lighting load while producing on-site renewable energy and sequestrating CO2. The biochromic windows, coupled with an intelligent control system, further enhance economic and environmental performance depending on solar intensity and carbon concentration. The view-out area within the biochromic window admits year round daylighting. Proximity to green nature is expected to provide aesthetic quality and emotional comfort for user satisfactions.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to help manage environmental change in coastal cities. Currently, a gap exists in the coastal infrastructure community for an effective solution that supports ecological health and community-based co-benefits over traditional gray infrastructure, such as seawalls, berms, or structured fill. This project addresses that gap through a novel full-scale experimental implementation of a reliable and durable network of floating biomass-based modules for coastal protection. The proposed project develops a dynamic, detail-oriented scientific approach and technical modeling. This project will demonstrate how an interconnected, anchored network of vegetated biomass modules can dampen wave energy, absorb water pollutants, and create an engaging community space for coastal cities.

    The technical innovations of the proposed SBIR Phase II project are: (A) a new material engineering approach for seaworthy floating modules based on biomass and living plants, anchored in a hexagonal array and interconnected; (B) a full numerical predictive modeling suite to simulate biogeochemical effects, fluid dynamic network effects, and hydrodynamic effects of large such networks of modules; and (C) a fully functional prototype network to study physical behavior and effects. This project consists of five separate experimental objectives: (1) extensive unit prototyping, redesign and monitoring to assess manufacturer material and biological behavior over time, (2) ecological monitoring of individual unit and network impacts leading to the development of a predictive biogeochemical model, (3) translation of physical wave tank lab results into a predictive coastal environment simulation model, (4) hydrodynamic analysis of a full-scale experimental network prototype, and (5) development of technical methods for production and deployment at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project benefitd the 70 million people struggling with gait disorders in the US. Gait analysis monitors how individuals walk to predict or prevent injuries and track rehabilitation progress. Due to the potentially high equipment costs, space requirements, and required technical expertise to collect and interpret results, detailed gait analyses are limited to a few centers and mainly used for surgical decision-making.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for gait analysis at roughly 70% less than typical costs, as well as offering reduced set-up time and improved workflow efficiency.

    The proposed project will address the existing technological and commercial barriers that make gait analysis an exclusive clinical tool restricted to only 300 gait labs across the country.  This project will develop a cost-effective markerless motion 3D-tracking system. Technical activities include: (1) increase the motion database to a diverse population, including children and patients with mobility impairments; (2) improve the computer vision algorithms to account for multiple individuals within the camera system?s field of view; (3) integrate EMG and Force Plates; (4) implement skeletal geometry estimation from computed tomography; (5) develop a self-calibration system that can operate with HD low cost cameras; and (5) improve accuracy and usability substantially to reduce the expertise required for computational gait analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve detection and enable prediction of implantable device failure. The first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain?s ventricles. Hydrocephalus is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail at alarming rates (40% within the 1st year of use), leading first to nonspecific symptoms such as headaches and blurred vision and then to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. The proposed sensor module can be integrated with already-commercialized shunt systems and may allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health, ultimately improving clinical outcomes while reducing overall treatment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the integration of various microsensors to generate a diagnostic data set for data analytics. This data set will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on CSF dynamics over time. The system would include several first-to-market capabilities, including chronic repeated measurement of CSF dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and dissemination. The smart shunt system will enable remote, on-demand monitoring of shunt status, giving physicians the data necessary for timely diagnosis and prediction of shunt failure. At-home electronic shunt monitoring will allow physicians to quantitatively and proactively manage patients? disease in real-time, and thereby improve their quality of life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will lead to the development of engineered neutralizing antibodies for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that can be used as therapeutic agents to diminish the severity of a COVID-19 infection and decrease the chances of hospitalization and progressive disease. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate it is necessary to increase collective preparedness by generating a wide collection of neutralizing antibodies that individually provide coverage for a range of variants (Delta, Beta, Omicron). These antibodies, when administered as an antibody cocktail, may offer broad protection over a diverse population of variants. This project?s approach generates neutralizing antibodies that are specifically engineered to bind to different regions of the spike protein thereby increasing the probability that one or more of the engineered antibodies will be effective against future mutated versions of the virus. The proposed combination of high-throughput screening, next-generation-sequencing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based antibody design allows systematic exploration of vast ranges of antibody sequences. This approach also has the benefit of engineering antibodies that are more potent, easier to administer, more stable under challenging environmental conditions, and less costly to manufacture, leading to therapeutics that can be more readily distributed to low-income countries.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to enable AI and machine learning antibody engineering approaches by providing needed antibody sequence mutation binding data. Currently available antibody datasets number in the thousands of datapoints and the team proposes to generate datasets that number in the tens of millions. The project will also be generating both positive and negative antibody binding data, potentially leading to higher performing learned antibody binding models. This project seeks to test the hypothesis that synthetic antibodies can be the equal of, or better than, naturally occurring antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This approach could potentially develop a wide range of antibody variations. The application of this AI-based antibody engineering will be focused on discovering a large array of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple, different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the combination of yeast-display, high-throughput fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and next generation sequencing. Combining these high-throughput data generation workflows with the latest deep neural networks may lead to a new methodology that can efficiently discover high performing antibodies for the current pandemic and those in the future.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce injuries and costs due to overexertion and heat strain in firefighting through a real-time, biometric monitoring system and accompanying analysis tools. This system collects each firefighter's vital signs and sends the data to authorized commanders for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, commanders can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Almost 60% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year, and associated costs total over $7 billion annually.  The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve other first responders, such as military personnel, industrial workers, and others with occupational risk.

    The proposed project will improve the occupational safety of first responders through the research and development of the following components:  1) An improved biometric collection wearable; 2) software used by the biometric monitoring system; 3) a location-monitoring tool; 4) algorithms to estimate sleep quality, fatigue, and detect symptoms for certain diseases, and improve exertion and core-body temperature estimates. 5) network improvement solutions allowing first responders in remote areas to utilize biometric monitoring tools. All five objectives will consist of multiple pilot studies with ongoing research and development that will incorporate crucial feedback from end-users. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for partnering fire and emergency services.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to ease the burden on early childhood teachers and ensure they have the information needed to support children?s learning. COVID-19 has upended the lives of millions of children and families and disproportionately affected low-income children. The incoming class of preschoolers have increasingly variable levels of development and skills than ever before, and educators need to assess their need and help them to catch up academically. The industry leading tools in early childhood assessment rely solely on observation-based assessment, in which teachers make judgments about a child?s performance based on observations made in the classroom. Observation-based measures have limitations, including time burden, teacher bias, and variability in scoring due to differences in teacher education and training. Observational assessment is especially challenging in the remote context, since teachers were not able to physically monitor children?s development. Even when children are back in the classroom, face masks may shield some of the more subtle cues around learning and development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to ensure an accurate assessment of child development, so that teachers can leverage the data for tailored instruction to help children catch up from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Child assessments are typically observational or direct. This Phase II project collects both observational and direct data, providing an opportunity to compare the data and help teachers understand areas where there may be assessment error due to teacher bias or other factors. At the end of Phase II, it is anticipated that teachers will have access to a self-led teacher training and reliability certification, which may help to ensure a more consistent assessment experience in the classroom. Moreover, educational programs will have access to an assessment quality monitoring dashboard that seeks to highlight differences between observation and game-based assessment scores and provide a path towards reconciliation. Educational programs may be able to customize this technology to fit the needs of English language learners, who are often subject to assessor bias. Finally, teachers may be able to leverage the game-based assessments to understand both academic and ?soft? skill development. Overall, the technology may\provide teachers with a robust child assessment system that helps them to accurately and efficiently assess whole child development.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the reduction of food waste and improved nutrition. Each year, more than 30% of fresh produce is wasted. The value of this wasted produce is estimated at more than $60 billion globally. This project?s main goal is to extend the shelf life of perishable foods with an edible coating that regulates the rate of both transpiration to slow moisture loss and respiration to delay ripening. The project aims to enable produce growers and distributors to preserve the freshness and quality of fruits and vegetables. Consumers could benefit by having access to fresher, tastier, and more appealing produce. This technology may also promote healthier food choices, especially in currently underserved food deserts. Packers would benefit by being able to offer a high-quality product that will last longer and that can better withstand the rigors of various types of transport. Extended shelf life also extends the market reach of U.S. exports in global markets.

    The core innovation underlying this project is the creation of stable Zein colloids that employ only edible, plant-based ingredients, are non-flammable, non-corrosive, and meet most global food regulations. These colloids will be initially developed as coatings for fresh whole or minimally processed foods, root crops, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.  The coating will not impede the delivery of nutrients, flavors, and other functional ingredients that make foods appealing, improve their quality, and encourage consumption.  The technology will also reduce food spoilage and improving food safety. Experimental work will be focused on further improving the stability of Zein dispersions and demonstrating the ability to adjust the film properties (water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide permeances) to respond to the physiology of a broad range of crops. This technology will also be piloted at various packing plants to evaluate its operational fitness with existing operations. This research will also enable related applications, such as for compostable coatings on food packaging and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the novel scientific knowledge gained by understanding the effects of high electrostatic fields on composite dielectrics, the translation of experimental materials to robust and high performance HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators, and, more generally, the impact of HASEL actuation technology within real-world applications. This knowledge contributes to many highly interdisciplinary fields of science, ranging from electrostatics, materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The advancements of HASEL actuators achieved during this project may have broad impacts on commercial, research, education, and defense sectors. These actuators may be an enabling component for a variety of industries including automation, automotive, medical devices, robotics, and defense applications. Key features of HASEL actuators include: analog motion, mechanical compliance, high speed, high strain, silent operation, customization, and self-sensing. By bringing forward actuator technologies, industries may adopt robotic technologies, strengthening the economic competitive advantage of these industries. The team will continue to leverage academic partnerships to contribute to and train a highly capable technical workforce of scientists and engineers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the performance of HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators. HASEL actuators harness electrostatic forces to drive shape-change in a soft hydraulic structure, providing a variety of muscle-like actuation modes and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. HASEL actuators address critical problems in existing soft actuator technologies. For example, soft pneumatic actuators must be tethered to a system of valves and pumps for high performance actuation, whereas HASEL actuators are electrically controlled and can be operated with battery-powered portable power supplies. The team will develop and validate approaches to advance the performance and ease of use of HASEL actuators. These advances of the technology will be realized through material optimization, fabrication improvements, and a more fundamental understanding of solid-liquid composite dielectric structures under high electrostatic fields. Performance improvements will be applied to actuators well-suited for industrial, consumer, defense, and experimental applications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a platform technology for creating rapid virus diagnostics that directly recognizes the virus surface protein pattern from a patient sample and generates accurate results within minutes. Current standards for high-fidelity viral pathogen diagnostics require complex instruments, technical expertise to run the instruments, and  hours to produce and interpret results. The proposed platform creates a virus-specific biosensor that selectively binds to the target virus and produces visible results without time-consuming pre-processing or expensive instruments. Lower cost tests and faster sample-to-result turnovers could result in more effective control of disease spread.

    This project seeks to develop a highly functional, sensitive, and specific diagnostic for the detection of coronavirus. This technology is based on the company?s Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The solution is a first-in-class diagnostics that uses algorithmically-designed structural DNA to form a trap that may detect and selectively bind a signature pattern of the pathogen. This recognition and binding may generate visual signals without the need of DNA/RNA preprocessing or amplification associated with the current generation of molecular tests (polymerase chain reactions, PCRs). This project will involve building a preclinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral flow based COVID-19 rapid diagnostics with a goal of providing results for each sample within 5 minutes.  This fast test result will be followed by preclinical validation to determine the test?s specificity, limits of detection, and implement mechanism to improve the assay specificity and to avoid cross-reaction to other virus types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide a more economical, scalable, and sustainable type of battery for storing the energy needed to support America?s growing renewable power grid. As more wind and solar power generation is being installed, there is a growing need for economical forms of energy storage to supply power during windless and sunless times. Older technologies like lithium ion and lead acid batteries are not ideal for this purpose due to problems with supply, safety, longevity, and sustainability. This project seeks to produce new chemical components to enable grid-scale batteries based on recyclable zinc metal, which offers a safer and more sustainable alternative grid-scale battery option. Furthermore, since zinc and its other battery components are sourced in the US, this project may help facilitate domestic battery manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign battery supplies.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to produce chemical additives that make zinc-bromine batteries last longer, hold more energy, and run more efficiently so that they can provide sustainable low-cost energy storage for renewable power. Presently, the major problems with these types of batteries are related to unwanted electrochemical side reactions that happen during battery charging. This project will eliminate these side reactions with stable, scalable, organic electrolyte additives designed to prevent problems at the zinc surface.  During this phase of the project, these electrolyte addititives will be modified and optimized for performance and scalability. They will be evaluated via testing in actual cells and full-size batteries by the battery manufacturers. By the end of the project, new class of enabling electrolyte may be available in large quantities to help establish safe, sustainable, domestically made zinc-bromine batteries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve distal extremity joint arthroplasty.  Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure to restore the function of a joint.  The proposed technology replaces cold knife, electrocautery, orthopedic saws and drills with a hand-held, all-tissue laser ablation system that fast cuts bone without necrosis. The effect is to reduce surgical time, create more precise cuts and drill holes, decrease recovery times, and reduce the need for opioid medications after surgery. The integrated visualization system may allow orthopedic surgeons to perform precise surgical planning that is difficult or impossible with current methods. While important in hips or knees, surgical precision is critical in wrists, ankles, and fingers/toes. The proposed device produced in this project may improve surgical success rates and reduce complications and revision surgeries, which will reduce patient suffering and excess healthcare costs. At the same time, the proposed tools may enable safe and successful distal extremity joint arthroplasty to be performed routinely.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an all-tissue laser-based orthopedic surgery system that integrates cameras for real-time, three-dimensional (3D) vision within a single handpiece. Conventional saws and drills compress and shear bones, causing postoperative joint pain and prolonging recovery times. A laser cuts by ablating tissue at its specific molecular absorption without killing the surrounding tissue (i.e., necrosis). One critical technical innovation in this project is to use a pulsed, high peak power, 9.3 ?m wavelength carbon dioxide (CO2) laser that rapidly ablates hydroxyapatite (bone) and water (soft tissue). The laser pulse widths are chosen to approach the tissue?s Thermal Relaxation Time, TRT, which eliminates necrosis. Another critical technical innovation is to integrate various cameras (similar to smartphone and confocal microscope cameras) within the 9.3 ?m ablation laser pulse train to provide real-time, high-definition, intraoperative vision. The proposed device may be enhanced to demonstrate sufficiently large bone ablation patterns, clinically acceptable bone ablation speeds, and non-tapered laser drilling tapering. The instrument will be housed in a handheld device that mimics existing orthopedic tools and will be run by firmware to perform at speeds necessary for clinical use.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve patient outcomes, and reduce\

    \ 400,000 CT-guided lung biopsies are performed in the US, and more than 1.2 million\
    \ worldwide. Management and treatment of symptomatic pneumothorax often requires\
    \ multi-day hospital stays and costs on average of $15,000 per patient and $1.3\

    \ ambulatory surgery centers in remote geographies to perform the screening procedure.\
    \ Currently, physicians collect limited biopsy samples due to the increased risk\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient?s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient?s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients? mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project?s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project?s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence/machinge learning (AI/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient?s future cognitive function.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to facilitate the blue economy?s continued transition to a big-data paradigm. Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation. The project enables adaptability by using an advanced control model methodology which adjusts the device hardware based on ambient environmental conditions for optimized performance. Due to the deployment environment, this project will capture training data under a laboratory setting, train the control model offline, and apply it in the field by leveraging edge computing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is potential commercial development of superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits with the ability to enable true biological brain-inspired deep neural network circuit algorithms and to improve efficiency, speed, and scalability of NC by orders of magnitude. The knowledge and approaches developed through this effort may help advance the foundational development of next generation computing hardware, helping NC continue its advance toward broad market adoption, and helping the US maintain its position as a leader in processor development and production. Additionally, the integrated synthesis-characterization-application approach can be extended to a range of applications, including sensors, metamaterials, catalysis, and renewables, which require atomic-scale control of materials and interfaces. Finally, through a partnership with University of Kansas, the project will facilitate university technology transfer and will serve to educate the next generation of materials and advanced electronics scientists and engineers. The atomic-to-nanoscale design, fabrication, characterization, and application experience will not only assist in recruiting top-quality students and provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits consisting of atomically tunable memristors (synapses) with superconductor interconnects and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs, neurons). This superconducting NC circuit aims to enable true biological brain-inspired deep network circuit algorithms and to achieve currently unattainable levels of energy efficiency, switching speed, and scalability in NC.  The proposed research will design, fabricate, and characterize superconducting memristor-SQUID NC circuit hardware including development of the corresponding algorithms for pattern recognition, with machine learning capabilities, using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database to prove viability. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is illustrated in: (1) novel, atomically-tunable memristors with 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic range in the on/off ratio and switching frequency that can enable spikes of different amplitudes and frequencies as demanded for emerging deep circuits, (2) SQUID neurons with very high sensitivity and low noise, and (3) neurons and interconnects that can significantly reduce power consumption by eliminating the parasitic wire resistance that, in current NC circuits, increases substantially with circuit scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions in order to make infrastructure and operational decisions. This decision-making capability is important as many facilities spend millions of dollars each year on improving sewer system function, yet are constrained by lack of quality data on sewer flows. Improved sewer flow data may help to optimize infrastructure improvements and reduce costs to taxpayers. In addition, this work may directly advance the health and welfare of the American public through improved wastewater collection systems operations and reduced overflows and basement backups. This technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to advance a novel, non-contact sensor that collects video of wastewater flow in sanitary sewer systems to measure flow rate and detect critical sewer events. Specifically, the technology collects video of sanitary sewer flows and processes it in real time using a machine learning algorithm to measure the velocity and water level of the flow. This technology also evaluates images of sewer flows to identify illicit discharges into the system. Several key technical hurdles crucial to successful commercialization of this innovation will be addressed in the proposed project, including the use of artificial illumination systems in closed pipe environments, the development of strategies to account for rapid variations in flow rates, and the development of data analytic methods to identify critical sewer events. Given these technical hurdles, the objectives of this project will be to develop a video-based flow sensor that can accurately capture velocity and water level under expected environmental conditions and to analyze data from the proposed sensor to accurately identify critical sewer events such as blockages and illicit discharges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may enable the generation of as much as 65% of a building?s energy needs from renewable heating and cooling, reducing consumption by 13 Quads and saving consumers potentially billions of dollars. Buildings account for 28% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide and at least 2/3 of these structures will still exist in the year 2040. Achieving significant energy coset reductions will require a retrofit solution that is competitive with natural gas and grid-powered heating and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Such a retrofit must also be easily deployed in a wide variety of building types and architectures. The technology under development is a roof-mounted, panelized array that provides solar heat during the day and radiatively cools at night. The technology may be able to supply building energy resources throughout the year, a disruptive capability for a rooftop clean energy solution. The low cost and renewable nature of this resource may also insure that building owners and residents have access to carbon-free energy that is less expensive, less volatile, and more resilient in the face of interruptions to energy supplied from conventional gas and grid sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to validate a panelized rooftop technology to renewably generate heating and cooling resources for buildings. Dominant solutions combust fuel for heat and use grid electricity to power vapor compression for cooling. The proposed solution describes an array of thermal panes that convert a roof into an active environmental interface that continually optimizes the extraction and rejection of heat via absorptive, radiative, and convective processes. The technology continually operates in response to building energy needs. By modulating pane thermo-optic properties the solution enables fluid flow to alter the internal optical and heat transfer configuration. Evaluation of the technology will begin with manufacturing prototypes that incorporate novel thermal bonding techniques for integrating foamed polyiso-, fluoro-, and poly-olefin polymers. A solar simulator will assess efficiency and output temperatures, an iterative process to explore the role of internal fluid flows, visble and infrared radiation paths, and thermal loss mechanisms. An array will be subsequently deployed on a rooftop and coupled to the building energy system. Data will be collected to assess the impact on energy consumption and overall heating/cooling while developing control algorithms for pane modulation.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to eliminate the wasteful and polluting\

    \ utilizing modified automotive engines as small compressors and chemical reactors.\
    \ More than 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas produced in remote regions\
    \ is flared (burned).  This quantity of gas is valued $1.9 billion in the US and\
    \ $18.4 billion globally and generates more than 400 million tons of carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2) equivalent emissions, as well as significant air pollution (i.e., particulate\
    \ matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides).  Currently, there\
    \ are no economically-viable solutions to address the flaring problem. Compressing\
    \ or liquefying the natural gas leads to prohibitively high operating costs, while\
    \ conventional gas-to-liquid chemical conversion systems are not cost effective\
    \ for the small scale required for remote flaring sites. Converting the flared\
    \ gas in the US to liquid chemicals would result in more than $6 billion/year\

    \ this specific application as it may be a stepping stone to the low cost, distributed\
    \ synthesis of fuels or chemicals or to avoiding waste from other stranded resources\

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a visuospatial educational assessment tool.  Visuospatial aptitude is a facet of intelligence that underlies innovative thinking, i.e., how do new ideas emerge? and What are the physiological processes involved? Today, there is an overwhelming exposure within society to digital visual stimuli and national assessment authorities acknowledge visuospatial abstract reasoning as an accepted and sought after cognitive ability. Future curriculum designs must develop along with how people are changing and perceiving knowledge. This project seeks to set standards in education on visuospatial ability by introducing a novel assessment. This visuospatial assessment tool will utilize a software platform that allows customers to take the assessment online, and has commercial potential to improve industry, science, and educational programs for the advancement of human communication.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the development of an information technology consisting of a visuospatial ability assessment for measuring the biological processes that are required for being creative. Humans are biologically predisposed both to perceive and to reproduce symmetry, mainly in visual form, but also aurally; This proposed visuospatial assessment tool measures some of the biological processes that are required for the perception and reproduction of symmetry. Specifically, this assessment measures a form of sensorimotor perceptual action referred to in this project as ?affective symmetry gauging? (ASG). ASG consists of a subject?s innate visual perception/identification of the division in extreme and mean ratio point (DEMR; i.e., the symmetry point) in a given pattern. Because this process measures the extent to which a subject can perceive/identify and reproduce the symmetry point in given patterns, the tool also suggests the degree to which a subject may be inclined to reproduce symmetry, marking this inclination as a natural human expression of creativity aligned to pleasingness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic. Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep, insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10 Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an innovation in sleep therapy.  Approximately half of all American adolescents and young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression, and suicide.  The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively advance teenagers? circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities. This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better sleep hygiene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its ability to use machine learning and wearable technology to reduce uncontrolled destructive episodees, known as meltdowns, in children with autism. Meltdowns are highly distressing events for these children and their families and may require intervention on behalf of emergency response personnel and healthcare providers. Treating individuals with autism by proactively detecting meltdowns will allow caregivers time to intervene, mitigate, and prevent the onset of destructive behavioral episodes. The ability to predict a meltdown, and then implement strategic intervention to prevent the meltdown, may have positive life-changing effects for the children, their families, and their caretakes by reducing social stigma, enabling more mainstreaming of school and family activities, and reducing significant financial healthcare burdens. This technology may also be used to mitigate panic attacks in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a wearable device that detects, predicts, and helps prevent meltdowns in children with autism. Wearable devices that measure physiological parameters are available in the market, but none of them are specific to autism, and none of them proactively predict behavior episodes. A unique feature of this wearable device is that it uses machine learning to predict meltdowns. Incorporating machine learning allows each device to learn the unique biometric signature of the wearer so it can predict meltdowns with high accuracy. When a child is at high risk for a meltdown, the device will detect the relevant physiology and alert caregivers and therapists in time to intervene. The objectives of this project are to create a prototype which includes the wearable product and the individualization enabled by machine learning to correlate a child?s biometric measures with behavioral states. The goal is to achieve decreased frequency and/or severity of meltdowns. By enabling caregivers of children with autism to take control of and prevent meltdowns, this project has the potential to eliminate the stigma these children face during a meltdown in public, and empowers the children to become more independent as they age.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help hospitals improve their sterile processing departments (SPD), where decontamination, sterilization, and assembly of medical equipment and devices occur. The company?s proposed solution seeks to enhance SPD technicians? work performance and skill levels, decrease SPDs? operating costs, reduce Hospital Associated Infections (HAI) and Surgical Site Infections (SSI), lessen expensive surgical delays, and reduce related healthcare service delivery costs. Sterile processing technicians play a critical role in preventing infection by sterilizing, cleaning, processing, assembling, storing, and distributing medical supplies. They are directly responsible for disinfection and sterilization of hospital instruments/devices. The team uses mixed reality designed to augment the day-to-day work responsibilities of SPD technicians while supporting the cost-effectiveness of operating a SPD. The solution?s digital content and holograms provide an immersive experience increasing competency, maximizing workflow, and boosting productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project incorporates three applications into augmented reality hardware to enhance the job performance of sterile processing department (SPD) technicians. The applications include barcode/radio frequency identification (RFID) reading, traceability and surgical instrument detection, and inspection utilizing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).  These applications are designed to provide efficient and accurate tracking, improved workflow, and increased worker productivity. The research goals of the project include creating a software application programming interface (API) capable of reading barcodes and RFID tags. By providing additional monitoring and tracking capabilities with automated data within the users' field of view and creating an application to enhance object detection capabilities, SPDs in hospitals, doctors' offices and at-home care locations can learn, in real time, the best practices for sterilization of infected surfaces to enable safer and healthier living and work spaces.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to engage citizen in environmental research activities, potentially increasing the selection of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers for youth. This project focuses on enhancing academic and industry partnerships around citizen science, improving science and environmental literacy, and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields of study. In addition to improving the nation?s scientific and technical workforce pipeline, the project seeks to employ a unique commercialization model for interactive educational media that allows for both authentic learning and widespread use by general audiences. This model mixes digital and in-person experiences, digital distribution methods, and mobile experience commercialization strategies that can serve as a model for other educational and commercial interactive media companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two critical issues: engaging more youth in environmental science and engineering education and increasing local environmental data for scientists. The project team will research and develop optimal methods and tools for creating educational and interactive media with rapid scientific data collection capabilities. For youth and educators, the project seeks to engage users in national standards-aligned scientific learning activities. The project will create hyperlocal networks that collect data and make results directly available to local communities so that they can actively track pressing environmental concerns such as migrations and changes in populations of species. The technical goals of the project include creating new processes for connecting local, crowdsourced user input to citizen science data repositories in a way that automates the categorization and validation of that data. The resulting project will actively engage youth in real scientific research and improve data collection for federal and university environmental science programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides virtual interfaces that can be dynamically customized to address the challenge of user adoption in augmented reality (AR) products. This project overcomes previous limitations for AR such as the lack of interoperability, user-acceptance, scalability, and application-aware user intent recognition. While the AR market is projected to grow, wearable collaboration has unexplored potential. Users empowered by this project may be able to easily collaborate alongside skilled experts as well as robotic interfaces in the same medium. Through contextually-aware dynamic controls, manufacturing businesses can lower the risk of human-error while increasing fulfillment capabilities, as employees working from home can stay physically connected and remain engaged with minimal compromise. The AR innovation proposed in this project has application across multiple industries, including manufacturing, training, and emergency simulations.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create a framework for scalable experimentation of virtual interfaces that empower users to search, tag, and store meaningful data using gesture interactions in a secure and private manner. This project seeks to provide context-based, hands-free interaction with wireless devices while minimizing the need to set up sensors (such as optical components or microphones) in controlled environments and providing visual feedback and accessibility to the end user. A wrist-worn wearable captures pre-trained gesture data, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses identifies and analyzes an object within the context of said gestures to control a mechatronic device, such as a robot, to perform occupational tasks. This dynamic process uses factors such as the user?s gaze area, physical location, and computer application.  The improvement upon gesture control may allow a separate visual unit, such as the AR glasses, to wirelessly receive and display the gesture intents and perform contextually-aware, meaningful interactions with a clear distinction across a plurality of devices or digitally tagged objects associated with a specific use-case.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is not limited to the higher education community, but has broader application at the elementary, middle and high school levels, especially in underserved and marginalized communities experiencing increased rates of suicide and mental health issues. This project's innovative technologies can assist in the mental health crisis in the country's youth, and specifically in the Native American health system as well as Juvenile Detainee/Juvenile Justice systems. This project's implementation of research based on the benefits of game-based intervention coupled with biometric sensing has the potential to provide the technologies necessary to equip the mental health profession to develop options that could replace pharmacological interventions with a path to delivering personalized and measurement-based mental health services.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses predictive algorithms, wearable technology and peripheral autonomic biofeedback to provide timely and effective data to enable mental health professionals to enact treatments and therapeutic support for students. Challenges in the increase of adult mental illness, shortage of mental health professionals and shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists require a move towards tele-psychiatry, collaborative care and innovative technology to bridge the gap between inadequate supply and increasing demand. The proposed approach involves the development of bio-behavioral technology that provides mental health professionals an interactive stress and anxiety evaluation to enable deep, transformative connections between young adults and mental health service providers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a technology that delivers low cost of energy from offshore wind and unlocks new markets inaccessible to current technology, e.g., small populations with smaller, locally-maintained turbines, deep water locations where conventional floaters are not economical, and regions lacking deep ports. If successful, the global impact may have the potential to suppress carbon emissions at the scale of gigaton carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent/year. The proposed technology is a floating wind turbine that may reduce 80% of the weight of a conventional floating turbine and makes it possible to fabricate more components locally, with domestic businesses and jobs. The newly proposed architecture will be tested to ensure it survives and operates well in the ocean environment. The crucial first step is to adapt the National Renewable Energy Laboratory?s (NREL) world-class wind-wave software to simulate the unusual motions of the system and demonstrate its viability. The end goal is the commercialization of a disruptive offshore wind turbine, developed in the U.S. and deployed globally, that can outcompete all of today?s designs, in a market estimated to soon reach ~$100 billion/year.

    This project seeks provide the intellectual foundation that leads to a first-of-its-kind class of offshore wind turbines that have minimal weight, that rides on top of the waves, taht expands deployability into regions inaccessible with current technology, and that increases mobility for installation / maintenance. Such a floating structure has never before been designed and this project may provide deep insight into several questions about the loading and motions that arise from a complex superposition of turbulent wind, random waves, ocean current, rotor elasticity and angular momentum, and dynamic blade pitch and generator control. This STTR proposal seeks to address a critical technical risk: adaptation of NREL?s simulator OpenFAST to characterize the unique motions of the system operating in a complex environment of loading from wave, wind and current and the resulting impacts on loading and power production. The proposed system departs from long-standing industry conventions that have relied on the design principle of limiting system motions. The results of the simulator may be used to refine the system design and then demonstrate that it's dynamic behavior complies with the design load cases required for certification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovaiton Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable method to grow healthy produce for individuals residential consumers, independent of location, climate, or season of the year. Rotary aeroponic growing systems have the potential to reduce food waste, potable water consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions by decentralizing the production of highly perishable produce within a consumer's home. Growing fresh produce in the home may not require the use of pesticides or preservatives. Socio-disadvantaged individuals located in food deserts may benefit from an automated indoor gardening appliance by subscribing to low-cost organic seed pods that could be delivered and grown directly in their home, generate long-term returns on investment and lowering instances of obesity through healthier diets. Studying the effects of light interactions in a small rotary aeroponic appliance my encourage a new market for high margin seed pods that could be assembled in mass quantities by disabled individuals. Converting highly perishable goods into non-perishable, subscription seed pods may have the potential to reduce food prices and reduce instances of food insecurity throughout the world.

    Rotary aeroponic cultivation is the method of growing plants on a rotating cylindrical tower that is affixed vertically within a controlled environmental chamber. The key innovation in this project is the coupling of rotary aeroponics with tunable lighting to enhance the growing efficiency of the plants. Phase II research will examine how the wavelengths and timing of the lighting can impact plant photomorphogenesis.  The tower design is expected to provide a larger surface area for growing plants in comparison to traditional vertical farming methods, increasing the number of plants that can be grown in a smaller space with less power consumption. The goal of this project is to successfully grow a healthy polyculture assortment of leafy green vegetables in a food safe environment. The multi-spectral light will be used to learn how to maximize plant yields, minimize food safety risks, and enhance the taste profiles of different plant types to ensure the best user experience.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the affordable and energy-efficient design of advanced powered lift aircraft, creating aircraft capable of transporting people and things to new locations. The reduction in transport cost and emissions made possible by this project may ensure that the advanced air mobility market, expected to grow to $120 Billion by 2030, develops community-compatible, economically- and socially-relevant mobility capabilities. The fundamental aerodynamic technology developed by this project may be applicable to a wide range of aircraft sizes and missions, enabling new capability in defense, public safety, and humanitarian roles as well as improving the quality of life for the public by enabling affordable, advanced mobility and logistics in urban, suburban, and underserved rural areas. The increased efficiency of the technology may enable these benefits to be realized while reducing the environmental impacts.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to confirm the feasibility of a new method of distributed electric propulsion for lift augmentation that combines high lift for low-speed performance with low drag, cruise-efficient wing design using a novel integrated propulsor. The project will explore the  complex and incompletely understood aerodynamic interaction of a propeller and wing, which is key to technical and commercial success. The technical objectives include: characterizing the slipstream influence on the wing pressure distribution and boundary layer characteristics, the influence of variations in propeller and wing configuration and location on high lift performance, and the aircraft level effects and tradeoffs of the configuration. The project seeks to meet these technical objectives with a combination of experimental wind tunnel research and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and analyses to thoroughly understand and characterize the complex flow physics and their impacts on aircraft performance and design. The effort may advance the propeller-wing interaction aerodynamics field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to potentially provide personalized hearing health care for those with hearing loss. Providing a customized amplification device and app solution that allows the user to understand speech more clearly may avoid audiologist appointments and allow the user to take control of their hearing right from their phone. Hearing loss is often associated with decreased employment and potentially lower income.  An effective amplification device may enable those with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to improve their employment and earnings.  Additionally, this technology may remove the discomfort that certain populations experience within the medical system and provide individualized empowerment in relation to their hearing.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to deliver personalized sound profiles from the comfort of the user?s home at a fraction of the cost of traditional hearing aid solutions. This self-fitting technology differentiates is differentiaed from the majority of over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer hearing solutions as the new technology allow the hearing aid enable personalize sound profiles in a variety of different listening environments. The technological goals are to allow users to optimize sound profiles in situ for live sound environments, and to standardize the software platform to enable partnerships with any hardware manufacturer in order to expand the suite of products that can help people hear clearly. The proposed project will continue the development of the technology including: increasing the range of frequencies that are adjusted during the self-fitting process, including the adjustment of non-linear gain parameters in the self-fitting process, an allowing users to obtain profiles for different listening environments.

    The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber ? designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.

    The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used in a variety of settings, including doctors? offices, physical therapy offices, and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of $1.7 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, ?green?, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the productivity and safety of operations across the entire $1.3 trillion Blue Economy. Maritime operations routinely involve significant risks to human life and property and consequently bear extraordinarily high operating costs. Autonomous ocean vehicles (falling under the Robotics technology area) are being rapidly adopted by science, commercial, and defense organizations due to their potential to dramatically reduce cost and risk. The success of the proposed project will advance the state of the art for commercial autonomous vehicle compliance with international laws regulating interactions between maritime vessels at sea. Giving autonomous ocean vehicles the ability to interact with crewed vessels safely and predictably will accelerate the adoption of these tools and the missions they enable. Several specific market segments stand to benefit immediately from the proposed technology, including the $31B offshore wind market, the $2B port automation market, the $233B aquaculture market, and dozens of others. Beyond market impacts, humanity needs ocean data to understand the critical dangers of overfishing and climate change.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the design of systems and software needed for autonomous ocean vehicles to comply with the international collision regulations (COLREGS) for maritime vehicles. The difficulty the industry has faced in creating COLREGS compliant autonomy is the fact that the rules were developed with the expectation that experienced mariners would be able to make qualitative interpretations in unique situations. That led to a descriptive rather than prescriptive set of rules that is good for human mariners, but difficult to implement in software. The objectives of this Phase I project include the design and simulation of autonomous systems able to operate in compliance with the COLREGS. In addition to simulations, the software may be deployed to small autonomous surface vehicles for preliminary on-water testing. Anticipated results include a system able to maintain COLREGS compliance within a documented envelope of conditions. The effective implementation of safe system design, optimized control, and machine learning techniques can combine to produce the first autonomous ocean vehicles that can be trusted in congested waterway settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to produce a high performance, low power, electronic chemical sensor system that does not require a radioactive ionization source. Achieving a low cost, non-radioactive Internet of Things (IoT) systems for chemical sensing in a more distributed and connected network has potentially far reaching implications in many industries. Creating an IoT network of sensors to safely monitor chemical signatures on a large and distributed scale, in real-time, may provide new analytical-quality chemical sensing capabilities. Sensor applications may range from engineering (monitoring fermentations) and to health care (diagnostics), to environmental monitoring (air quality) and defense and security (hazard detection) or agriculture (waste mitigation). The chemical sampling and sensor platform has the potential to be integrated with cell phones and autonomous systems. The market for personal use devices could be substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to establish an experimental and theoretical framework to optimize Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) for analytical quality chemical identification. There are many types of chemical sensors that have been commercialized but no high-quality systems meet the performance, safety, and cost constraints required to be a successfully linked in an IoT system. The fundamental physics and commercial utility of DMS is well established, so it is a leading candidate for this use. The foundation of the system is a miniaturized DMS. Because the microchip operates on lithium ion polymer batteries, it has the potential for widely dispersed IoT-linked chemical sensing but the reliance on radioactive isotopes for chemical ionization is a critical barrier to adoption that limits commercial applications. This technical barrier may be overcome by combining a non-radioactive, plasma-based method of chemical ionization. The experimental results will be used to validate custom software to simulate performance of this complex system. If the performance of the combined system can be successfully modeled, it can be further miniaturized and optimized.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to facilitate ocean data collection. Understanding the oceans is important for climate research, naval operations, maritime domain awareness, and ecosystem preservation, yet traditional data collection methods using research ships, commercial vessels, and buoys are cumbersome, expensive, and  limited in their scope of discovery. While satellites have enabled remote data collection, they are affected by weather and limited in the types of data they collect. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) - robotic boats - are promising, but even today?s smallest oceangoing USVs are too costly for many applications. Thus, many regions of Earth?s oceans are rarely studied. The technology developed here aims to meet this need by enabling low-cost deployment of sensor-equipped robotic fleets. Better access to ocean data may improve understanding of the ocean and its resources, leading to better climate modeling, improved safety, economic gains, and more effective regulations. Further, ocean monitoring and surveillance is key to understanding ocean water quality, identifying contaminants, and devising strategies to prevent future contamination and pollution of the ocean?s waters. Ultimately, cost-effective oceanic data collection may help sustain and grow the ocean economy.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a small, low-cost, autonomous robotic sailboat that uses an innovative sail arrangement and weather-optimized navigation system. With a combination of affordability and utility, the technology represents a new approach for widespread oceanic data collection. This technology can be deployed virtually anywhere in the ocean, can be small (2 meters or less), and is 100% wind- and solar-powered. The research in this project seeks to further this technology by advancing two innovations: passive directional stability and weather-optimized navigation. Unlike most other robotic sailboats, the proposed USV does not need active steering to hold a course, once set. Further, the proposed USV has a navigation system that exploits the spatial and temporal variance in the weather and uses local weather data to direct the boats to navigate more efficiently. This STTR proposal seeks to address areas of high technical risk including stability of the steering system under various wind and water conditions, resistance to traveling excessively downwind during storms, effectiveness of the optimized navigation system in both actual and simulated weather conditions at locations worldwide, construction and performance of prototypes in lakes and oceans, and long-term resistance to marine environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to facilitate improved animal husbandry practices by providing high-performance natural supplements that can replace prophylactic antibiotics, drugs, and hormones. The use of medically-relevant antibiotics in animal feed initiated the spread of ?super bugs,? causing a public health concern. Reducing the dependency on antibiotics in animal feed requires a concerted effort from multiple sectors. The outcome from this project may provide pragmatic alternatives to using antibiotics. Through research and demonstration, this project aims to overcome consumer skepticism towards accepting new supplements and contribute to maintaining profitability in animal farming even after antibiotics are eliminated from feed.

    The proposed project uses state-of-the-art computational tools in enzyme design to create new biocatalysts with tailored microorganisms. The resultant designer microorganisms with new functionalities may produce supplements used in animal feed using sustainable bioprocesses. A crucial component of the project is to design efficient bioprocesses that provide supplements that are fungible with existing supply chains, without the need for any additional on-farm infrastructure. Many natural supplements are either extracted from plants or produced using harsh processes, contributing to their expense. Successful completion of this project may overcome geographical or seasonal limitations in supplment production and represent the use of cutting-edge technology in the dietary supplements sector.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a technology for advanced geophysical density measurements and the monitoring of fluid fronts in soils based on the passive detection of naturally occurring cosmic rays. The primary application area for this project is the mining sector, where the technology may be able to drive efficiency improvements (up to 10%) in the recovery of copper and other key metals. These efficiencies could potentially result in a value opportunity of close to $1 billion per year in the US alone. The technology can also be applied to monitoring the stability of dams and levees, a widely-recognized ongoing concern, where it can provide safety and environmental benefits to the industry and society at large.

    The intellectual merit of this project is primarily related to both the continued development of field-ready instrumentation and of original data inversion methodologies. This includes: i) validation of the prototype sensor developed in Phase I under control conditions; ii) development and testing of fit-for-purpose conveyance and other hardware required for remote operation; iii) development of an original, three-dimensional data reconstruction algorithm driven by customer needs; and iv) development of commercially ready answer products and user interfaces. These innovations will serve to demonstrate the feasibility, technology readiness, and value of the proposed solution to the mining industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.  Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks to  disrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to serve the breast cancer community. In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is equitable access to a quality science education regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location. Across the nation, science illiteracy is an ongoing issue with only 30% of students testing as having a basic knowledge of science. As a result, the U.S. does not have enough trained scientists to commercial or academic laboratories. This situation has been deemed a national crisis and is considered a risk to U.S. national security. A quality science education has lasting benefits to students including more persuasive and clear communication skills, and the ability to design and develop critical approaches to problem-solving. The long-term goal of this program is to raise science literacy across the nation and provide career readiness training for the next generation of scientists. The program meets all three dimensions of Next Generation Science Standards. A book version of the program is being rolled-out to independent study charter schools in California. The online program will be tested in schools which have adopted the books.  Both book and online versions will be expanded to charter schools, private schools, and eventually public schools. Modules of the program may be adopted in areas without access to high-speed internet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses inequities in science education by providing an independent study application that includes step-by-step instruction for a hands-on chemical laboratory. All hands-on laboratories use reagents commonly found in the home for safety and accessibility reasons. Experiments are designed to be done without the need for a trained science teacher in the room. Studies show that hands-on learning is more impactful than computer simulations. Low-cost scientific equipment is also being developed. A hand-powered spinning centrifuge is under final design. During Phase II, a drug discovery module will be developed where students can find a potential cure for a disease in their own kitchen or classroom. Aims also include modifying the online application to make it easily expandable, scalable and maintainable for the long term. The application development includes technical optimization for reliable deployment nationwide and new interfaces to allow educators to upload content directly into the application. The project also includes security audits of the application including user information. Financial information will be managed through a third-party application. The product will be iteratively tested in classrooms and homeschools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is to enhance the scientific and technological understanding of designing lift-assist exosuits (mechanized clothing), an assistive technology that has the potential to impact society by reducing the fatigue, back injury risk, and back pain of delivery drivers. For employers, the exosuit creates the potential for reduced employee turnover and medical costs.  The proposed exosuit has potential commercial impact as the first and only lift-assist exosuit for delivery workers, a ubiquitous and growing job sector that cuts across nearly all commercial markets. This project could additionally impact the economic competitiveness of the United States by increasing the available workforce and reducing the cost of healthcare for Americans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address key design challenges associated with assistive technologies that provide lift-assistance for delivery drivers. Surmounting this technical hurdle relies on two key features: (1) the ability to turn assistance on/off when carrying an object, and (2) the ability to sit comfortably for long periods of time while driving. The research objectives of the Phase II project are to: 1) add a new mode-switching capability, 2) integrate a unique method of disengaging assistance that maximizes comfort during sitting, 3) create a novel leg sleeve to maximize comfort when the exosuit is not assisting, and 4) carry out a field study to validate exosuit performance in real-world conditions. This project will combine technical requirements and user stories with a series of rapid design iterations. Using this approach, multiple prototypes will be designed, built, and tested with delivery drivers to assess real-world performance and user acceptance. This project is projected to result in a commercially viable exosuit prototype that fits the daily needs of delivery drivers, as well as objective and subjective evidence of its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project is the creation of a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost, semi-automatic. ultra-high-altitude balloon system for suborbital transportation system. The technology seeks to provide routine sub-orbital atmospheric flights for environmental testing of payloads in the ultra-low vacuum of the Mesosphere (260,000 feet).  The technology also seeks to transport metrological payloads, such as radiosondes (that measures pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) and rawinsondes (that evaluate wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) at all altitudes from the ground to 260,000 feet for extended periods of time. This capability is especially critical for increasing the success rate of space missions. The new testing capability may save the space industry hundreds of million dollars in technology failures annually. The transportation of metrological payloads to the upper extremes of the atmosphere for extended periods of time may also provide improved accuracy of weather forecasts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to solve well-known problems that prevent balloons from taking payloads to the upper atmosphere. This project will develop hardware prototypes, perform software development, and integrate the hardware and software together.  The team will perform flight demonstrations to characterize the impact of the Mesospheric environment on the ballooning flight transport and demonstrate the low-cost payload transport to the Mesospheric sub-orbital altitudes for a long duration (> hour).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate the adoption of error correction technologies in the quantum computing industry.  It is widely held that quantum error correction will be critical to realize the potential of universal quantum computing.  An error-corrected quantum computer holds promise for making transformational discoveries in science and engineering that will have broad impact across traditional technology sectors. By developing resource-efficient quantum error correction design and decoding software tools, this Phase I project aims to hasten the era of error-corrected quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new method for error syndrome extraction from a register of data qubits during the execution of an error-corrected quantum algorithm. In contrast to the standard approach to syndrome extraction, where each quantum codeword is treated independently, this new approach extracts error information from the entire quantum computer collectively.  The algorithmic and cost advantage of the proposed approach is a reduction in the number of extra qubits required for error syndrome extraction. This project will focus on reducing the density of the quantum circuits used for syndrome extraction according to the new approach. Low-density quantum circuits are critical for robust quantum error correction since syndrome extraction is mediated by two-qubit entangling gates, which often have error rates higher than idling or memory errors occurring in the data qubits. Another objective of this Phase I project is to design low-density error correcting codes that promote locality in syndrome extraction. Local syndrome extraction is important for error correction in quantum processors that support limited connectivity between qubits. A final objective is to benchmark the proposed constructions and algorithms on simulated data and perform proof-of-concept experimental validation on cloud-based quantum computers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the high costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) methods. HVAC constitutes approximately 48% of building energy consumption representing a significant cost to society. Much of this energy is generated by fossil fuels, resulting in substantial environmental impacts: carbon emissions associated with residential and commercial use are 35.6% of total US emissions.  Geothermal or ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) represent the most energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly HVAC solution currently available, however, their high upfront capital costs have significantly slowed their deployment. The innovation in the present project takes a fundamentally different approach to GSHP heat transfer, resulting in reductions of 50% in installation costs and 20% in operating costs compared to conventional GSHP systems, enabling an expansion of the geothermal market. The present project seeks to thoroughly field test and analyze the performance of the GSHP innovation, optimizing the fabrication and installation parameters, and readying it for commercial deployment.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address the high installation cost and large, disruptive footprint of conventional GSHP systems. The project objective is to demonstrate a compact, cost-effective, easily-deployable, renewable solution for HVAC. The advection-driven GSHP (AGHP) takes advantage of the 4-5 times greater heat capacity of water than rock. Under the present project, AGHP will advance beyond numerical and laboratory analyses to manufacturing and field testing performance under real-world conditions. The research objectives include: 1) finalization of field site, 2) preliminary design and numerical modeling of the AGHP system for a chosen field site; 3) engineering retrofit design; 4) fabrication of the custom designed submersible pump and heat exchanger; 5) installation and testing of the AGHP system; 6) operation, monitoring, and analysis of the performance of AGHP system, including the development of a comprehensive cost, energy use, and emissions model for the AGHP system; and 7) use of the compiled data to estimate the potential for the economic viability of AGHP in various regions of the United States. The anticipated result of this project is a commercially-ready GSHP product with design and installation guidelines for determining the potential for deploying the innovative AGHP system at any given location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create very low power and very high capacity optical interconnects for general computer applications. Computer performance is limited by the speed, power, and latency of connections between chips and memory. The limitations of electrical interconnects are well known, and optical interconnects overcome the limitations and offer 100-1000 times performance improvements. While historically optical interconnects have been hampered by high cost and high power, recent developments show that the promise of optical interconnects can be practically realized. Optical interconnects will dramatically improve overall performance of enterprise and cloud computing services, especially when used in data center computers, while reducing electrical power consumption. This will in turn permit a vast improvement in resource utilization and dramatic reduction in the cost of computation across all segments of society

    The proposed project will develop an optical peripheral component interconnect expreess (PCIe)-compatible transparent bridge for general computer interconnects. PCIe is the most prevalent interconnect used today in computers. The technology developed in this proposal, based on light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitters, multicore optical fibers, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photodetectors, seeks to  reduce electrical power consumption from ~10 pJ/bit for electrical solutions to ~100-200 fJ/bit. The use of LEDs leverages investments already made for cost and power effective LED lighting and displays. The small size of the LEDs and multicore fibers allows for data densities of >1 Pbps/cm2. Electrical interconnects and other optical interconnect technologies cannot compare with the performance of these LED based optical interconnects. These advantages enable physical disaggregation of the compute, storage, and memory functions, improving system performance and resource utilization. This Phase II effort is focused on the development of a PCIe-compliant transparent bridge for applications in chip to chip and chip to memory interconnects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, which affects about one in eight men and is the second deadliest cancer among men. The current process for diagnosing prostate cancer is imprecise and commonly involves multiple rounds of increasingly invasive, uncomfortable, and expensive diagnostic tests. The medical technology proposed in this project will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging tests (MRIs) performed to confirm diagnosis, and enable improved ongoing monitoring of suspected or recovered prostate cancer patients. The proposed device will help hospitals save valuable time and decrease overall costs of care. The device will be designed to address the specific needs of clinicians to accurately diagnose prostate cancer cases at an earlier point in the diagnostic workflow, at a lower cost to health systems. Additionally, the technology will be developed with a focus on cost effectiveness, to ensure increased prostate cancer diagnostic capabilities are accessible even in low-resource settings, such as rural communities and low- and middle-income countries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a prototype of a new medical device that uses photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and novel acoustic lens technology to aid in detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Existing early testing options, such as digital rectal exams, prostate-specific antigen tests, and transrectal ultrasounds, are often inconclusive. The PAI endoscopic probe device proposed in this project will offer hospitals and clinicians a new method for visualizing potentially cancerous prostate tissues, with higher imaging contrast and resolution than existing diagnostics. It will also offer an alternative to other testing methods with known deficiencies that often result in misdiagnosis or missed cases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a biosensing technology that may enable highly sensitive, quantitative, point-of-care diagnostics. Once validated, the proposed biosensor, disposable sensor chips/cartridges, and electronic readout modules can be readily mass-produced using existing medical device manufacturing capacities. The technology may have an impact on the health and welfare of patients. The immediate goal is to examine interleukin protein monitoring for early detection of cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening health complication that develops in patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment, organ transplant, infectious disease, sepsis, etc. Additional applications include early detection of cancers or cancer recurrence, dry eye disease, existing and emerging infectious disease, biothreats, etc.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a proof-of-concept demonstration of a low-cost, magnetic biosensor technology that may enable analytical laboratory capabilities for reliable biomarker detection and quantitation at the point of care. The proposed biosensor will be adapted for quantitative detection of interleukin proteins in blood for early diagnostics of cytokine release syndrome. The technology integrates magnetic sensing into the ubiquitous lateral flow assay (LFA) format (used in pregnancy tests) utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as reporters of biomolecular interactions. The tests are well-suited for point-of-care applications where rapid and convenient access to low-cost diagnostic tools helps improve patient care. The rationale for this project is that the proposed biosensors can provide clinically-relevant quantitative data rivaling those of state-of-the-art laboratories while preserving the advantages of LFA tests in terms of low cost and ease of use. The disposable chip with its clam-shell design builds upon the usual LFA cassette design. The disposable chip will be produced and assembled from low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and is expected to add only cents to the cost of an LFA test. A low-cost portable reader capable of ultrahigh sensitivity quantitative readings will be built from conventional off-the-shelve electronic components.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project on a handheld simultaneous translator advances the state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning acceleration. Beyond technical contributions, the novel translator will likely have a significant impact on a wide range of domains, such as military personnel deployed in foreign countries, businesspeople participating in multilingual meetings, medical service providers, law enforcement, customer support services, diplomats and political representatives, local governmental entities providing services to citizens in the preferred language, and international tourists. As such, the project will have broader impacts in increasing economic competitiveness, advancing health and welfare, and improving military capabilities of the United State. Furthermore, the project helps to enhance equity in education and STEM literacy by enabling better access to educational resources to people of diverse backgrounds, especially immigrants, women, and underrepresented minorities in some countries/regions, who were previously disadvantaged due to limited prior educational access or limited access to foreign language courses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the research and development of innovative algorithmic optimizations and a purpose-built translation device to enable fast, accurate and low-power inference for simultaneous translation. The overall approach is to exploit the unspoken but implied connections among language elements at various levels to guide the learning model. Specific techniques are investigated at the phoneme-level, work-level, and sentence-level. Collectively, these innovations aim to reduce the computation complexity of simultaneous translation by orders of magnitude while increasing translation accuracy. A systematic and comprehensive methodology is also being established that allows fast implementation of the inference hardware via high-level synthesis and reports detailed statistics on translation accuracy, latency, power, and area to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the research.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to promote increased recycling and to enable the upcycling of two of the most common polymers found in mixed waste streams: polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). While plastic recycling can assist in mitigating the vast and continuously growing volume of plastic waste, mixed plastic streams?notably those with PE and iPP?introduce many challenges.  These polymers are immiscible but of similar density, making them unsuitable for simple melt-blending yet difficult to separate. Although additives have been developed to overcome the immiscibility issue, these additives typically need to be added at high loadings and produce resins with poor mechanical properties. This project focuses on the development of advanced additives (compatibilizers) that can be introduced in low concentrations to produce PE/iPP resins with superior durability, ductility, and industrial utility that rivals or outperforms homopolymers. Such a technology has the potential to bring superior efficiency to the mixed recycling process, advancing the field toward a more circular plastics economy. By delivering high-value products from waste streams, widespread adoption of this technology would drive improvements in plastic waste collection, recycling, and re-manufacturing, supporting jobs in these and adjacent fields.

    This project involves the creation of non-reactive, multi-graft copolymers capable of supporting high-quality iPP/PE blends with superior tensile strength characteristics, impact resistance, and rigidity compared to current resins. The proposed approach leverages interlocked molecular entanglements and co-crystallization to provide stronger adhesion to iPP and PE. This technology seeks capability of up to 30% iPP contamination in PE using as little as 1 wt% additive to generate high-value blended materials. Phase I development will involve: 1) optimization of polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymer compatibilization additives, 2) scale-up of optimized polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymers, 3) testing of larger scale batches for end polymer qualities, and 4) testing of compatibilizers with combinations of different grades of actual post-consumer plastic waste. The technology may contribute to an enhanced understanding of how specific copolymer architectures influence compatibilization efficiency, while also meeting the need for technologies to support compatibilization of PE and iPP for blended recycling applications.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ Research (SBIR) project is to bring to market a novel self-buoyant panel that\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the foundation of a fractional-calculus-based computational platform for the simulation of multiscale and multiphysics systems. This Phase I effort will focus on developing modeling capabilities for nonlinear thermomechanical fatigue and damage behavior of ductile materials and will provide important insights on both feasibility and performance of the fractional calculus approach for a class of nonlinear problems that is not only of extreme importance for scientific and industrial applications but it is also a prototypical example of multiscale and multiphysics systems.
    By leveraging an advanced and generalized class of operators, namely the distributed and variable-order fractional operators, this project will develop fatigue and damage mechanics simulation software capable of continuum scale computational efficiency and microscale accuracy. The resulting formulation will offer an unprecedented combination of computational efficiency, a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, and a revolutionary adaptive mathematical structure that evolves in real-time based on the underlying physics controlling the deterioration and damage process.

    The overarching innovation at the basis of the M3SIM software products is a one-of-its-kind computational platform based on cutting-edge distributed-variable order (DVO) fractional calculus (FC). The unique nature of DVO operators allows the new platform to perform multiscale and multiphysics analyses of complex systems at a level of accuracy and efficiency that is unattainable with traditional methods. This new approach will have profound practical implications for predictive science because it will enable a novel concept of an adaptive computational platform whose structure evolves with the underlying physics without a priori and ad hoc decisions from the user.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major fundamental knowledge gaps underpinning the ability to create accurate flood maps. This proposal will advance new knowledge on the use of advanced analytics for the estimation of floods, thus transforming the tools available to respond and plan for flooding. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that building-scale flood detection will be achieved through a combination of existing sensors and advanced analytics. This SBIR project will research and develop data-driven flood maps to support targeted flood response and long-term infrastructure planning. Using advanced analytics, existing sensor data will be spatially distributed to create real-time flood maps. The method will be validated using a highly dense sensor network in the Great Lakes region. The technical results of this project will yield unprecedented insights and measurements of uncertainty related to flood estimation at urban scales. The resulting real-time flood maps will allow stormwater managers to stay ahead of resident complaints, while saving lives and property by sending their crews to the most important locations. Improved flood maps will also allow stormwater managers to maximize the impact of long-term infrastructure investments.

    The project's goal is to make all communities resilient to floods and climate change. To that end, this proposal will show how advanced analytics, driven by wireless sensing, will transform the ability of first responders to save lives, while helping stormwater managers maximize long-term infrastructure investments. The key innovation of this proposal is a data methodology, which will convert raw, spatially distributed sensor data into actionable, real-time flood maps. This data-driven technique will enable the first of its kind tool to detect floods at the scale of individual buildings, without requiring a sensor at every location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) ?always-on? toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power ?always-on? IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be transformational to multiple markets that require energy storage. High-energy densities will be enabled by the proposed advanced polymer separators. Potential customers for the new battery separator include battery manufacturers for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, space and military, small wearable devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), drones, consumer electronics, as well as automotive manufacturers in the mass mobility market. Adoption will be driven by the huge demand for electric vehicle batteries that are cheaper, lighter, safer and allow for longer drive ranges and reduced charge time. There are multiple ways in which consumers and society will benefit from the batteries enabled by this novel solid-state separator; from electric cars, to flying taxis; from more efficient energy storage grids to more reliable space vehicles; from lighter wearable devices to long lasting medical implants. In the long-term, the successful development of low-cost, fast-charging, high-density, long-life, and safe batteries enabled by the company?s new separator will reduce fossil fuel dependency and drive the electrification of the transportation sector and the transition towards greener energy solutions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an advanced polymer separator for novel hybrid solid/liquid battery cells which will dramatically improve performance of state-of-the-art solid-state batteries, enabling higher energy density, faster charging rate and enhanced safety over commercial Lithium-ion batteries. The new separator will be constructed from a novel polymer material whose feasibility has been validated at laboratory level. Stability tests showed higher conductivity and stability than currently available options. Compatibility with high-voltage cathodes was also demonstrated in preliminary studies. The goals of the project are (1) to develop a solid electrolyte which has an ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes that are currently used in the Li-ion batteries and (2) a scalable solid separator (using the above electrolyte) that is compatible with high-voltage cathodes (4 ? 6 V). Main technical hurdles to overcome for successful commercialization are developing blade-cast-worthy slurries and scaling up the separator to a cell-size free-standing sheet. The former will be achieved by tuning the composition of the slurry to improve solubility; the latter will be achieved by improving the molecular weight of the polymer and blending and mixing it with ceramic oxide.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project will be the development\
    \ of a solar-based water purification solution that has the potential to overcome\
    \ the persistent barriers to safe drinking water access plaguing the more than\
    \ 81 million Americans living in counties with elevated water quality issues.\
    \ As the frequency of climate-related natural disasters and the prevalence of\
    \ contaminated drinking water supplies (e.g., from detection of per-/poly-fluoroalkyl\
    \ substances (PFAS) ?forever chemicals?) increases, there is an urgent need for\
    \ easily implementable water treatment options to maintain access to safe drinking\
    \ water. Offering an off-grid, cost effective, energy-free approach, this technology\
    \ is suited to provide a safe drinking water solution that can be cost-effectively\
    \ deployed without requiring a water infrastructure overhaul. In contrast to existing\
    \ water treatment approaches, which rely on energy inputs and infrastructure investment,\
    \ the proposed technology is both sustainable and reliable, and has the flexibility,\
    \ modularity, and scalability needed for facile deployment. Potential commercial\
    \ impact of this disruptive technology is high, considering the number of communities\
    \ currently seeking water treatment solutions that would be easily met with the\
    \ technology, and the subsequent jobs created related to installation and maintenance.\n\
    \n \nThe technical innovation of this project comes from the development of a\
    \ solar absorber gel (SAG) membrane that passively purifies water using natural\
    \ sunlight or a waste heat source. This system is designed to selectively capture\
    \ clean water at low temperatures and release it under natural sunlight at higher\
    \ temperatures. Compared to other passive solar water purification methods, which\
    \ rely on the energy-intense evaporation and condensation processes, this technology\
    \ does not rely on a phase transformation but instead absorbs and releases liquid\
    \ water due to minor temperature swings and can achieve the critical temperature\
    \ for water release within a matter of minutes. This system holds promise for\
    \ both modular and stationary water purification in a sustainable manner. Phase\
    \ I project will focus on demonstrating performance capabilities to meet drinking\
    \ water standards, improving water collection rates, and enhancing the durability\
    \ of the membranes. The objectives include: 1) investigating the properties and\
    \ performance of SAG membranes with an open-cell membrane structure that dramatically\
    \ improves the water purification rate; 2) performing detailed investigation on\
    \ the SAG rejection rate to harmful mixed impurities and meeting National Sanitation\
    \ Foundation standards; and 3) assessing the long-term reusability of the SAG\
    \ membrane, including on accelerated degradation studies.\n\nThis award reflects\
    \ NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation\
    \ using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the global autonomous detection of surface deformation. Measuring Earth surface deformation is fundamental to detect and analyze surface and subsurface changes due to anthropogenic activity, with a myriad of industrial applications that includes the monitoring of oil and gas extraction fields and storage reservoirs, mining operations, carbon dioxide sequestration, and/or infrastructure integrity. Illustrating the economic and social impact of its uses, the market for analyzing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data is expected to double within 5 years. Beyond the dramatic economic growth of InSAR, its far-ranging applications have broad social and scientific impacts, in particular related to natural hazards and climate change.  Advances in InSAR processing and improved signal-to-noise ratios will translate into improved monitoring of earthquake activity, landslides, water supplies, deforestation, floods, ice sheets, etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at tackling the lack of automation in InSAR processing and improving detection thresholds in InSAR time series analysis. While the technique can potentially measure millimeter-scale changes in deformation over periods of days to years, atmospheric effects can wreak havoc on repeat-pass InSAR interpretation by introducing errors that may mask small surface deformations. These effects, which are fundamentally due to pressure, temperature and relative humidity variations in the troposphere, can lead to errors that are larger than most of the deformation signals of interest. Current algorithms are not suited for automated, large-scale monitoring without a priori data because they require time-consuming manual intervention, and the final product requires exhaustive expert interpretation. Through the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods this project aims at: (i) further automating and accelerating the processing of InSAR time series, via the automation of some key sections of the processing pipeline that still rely on extensive and costly human intervention; and (ii) developing a new methodology to generate InSAR time series, that is robust to noise and allows for a finer temporal and spatial resolution compared to the state-of-the-art.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the health and welfare of the American public. Obesity among American adults has risen from 12% in 1990 to over 40% today, leading to an estimated medical cost of $260 billion in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). According to the National Institute for Health (NIH), 70% of American adults were overweight or obese in 2014. In 2013, American adults were spending $60 billion annually on weight loss, according to US News & World Report. A 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine study showed that those who kept daily food journals lost twice as much weight as those who did not. However, existing diet tracking methods are often too time-consuming for maintaining long-term weight loss. A personalized artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot could make food logging fun and easy, benefitting millions of Americans who are trying to lose weight and furthering knowledge on spoken dialogue systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance knowledge in the field of spoken dialogue systems in several ways. First, the project establishes a new research area by noting that AI and spoken dialogue systems have yet to be applied to nutrition. Typically, conversational agents focus on factual question answering or tasks such as flight booking, but there is an opportunity to leverage big data for learning relationships between diet and health. Second, this project will develop a neural generative chatbot model with memory, demonstrating the benefit of personalized conversational interactions with intelligent agents that remember the history of conversations and personal details about the user. While manually writing chatbot responses ensures more control over the output, the drawback is that the responses are less interesting, diverse, and flexible. This work proposes generative Transformers in order to generate more realistic, human-like responses and knowledge graphs as a novel method for remembering the conversation and diet tracking history of each user for personalized feedback. Finally, this project proposes the application of causal inference, often used for medical diagnosis, to the new, challenging task of predicting which foods lead to outcomes such as gut symptoms, weight loss, or muscle building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an acceleration in how new materials are discovered, designed, and commercialized in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  One aim is to increase the use of renewable electricity in the chemical and energy industries.  A major hurdle is the lack of efficient electrocatalysts that enable renewable processes, such as green hydrogen production, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into carbon-neutral chemicals and fuels, or other processes that can broadly decarbonize various industries. Traditional discovery methods are slow and serial, which limits the development of novel, commercially viable electrochemical processes demanded by the climate crisis. This project will enable a more rapid and exhaustive search for electrocatalysts, resulting in a deeper understanding of the nature of catalysts, and facilitating the decarbonization of the chemicals and energy industries by displacing traditional fossil fuel-based processes with a transition to electrification which utilizes increasing levels of renewable energy. The proposed platform will expedite the discovery and development of enabling materials, which can be brought to market and deployed globally to enable more renewable chemical processes.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a generalizable platform that can rapidly search through vast materials spaces for higher performance electrocatalyst materials, displacing the current materials which are simply the best amongst the limited candidates tested to date. Using this project?s proprietary Megalibrary technology, which enables the rapid synthesis of libraries of tens of thousands of unique, well-defined, monodisperse, and complex metal nanoparticles in a single experiment, coupled with high-throughput screening technologies, it is possible to quickly probe hundreds of thousands of unique catalyst candidates to find electrocatalysts optimized for performance. To accomplish this goal, the project must adapt protocols to allow the synthesis of electrocatalyst Megalibraries on electrodes and enable electrocatalyst screening. Additionally, the approach requires robust and high-throughput screening methods that can site-specifically interrogate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst candidates. Using these two innovations, it will be possible to then demonstrate the power of the platform by searching the entirety of a three element platinium and materials (Pt-M1-M2) space for the best hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst on a per platinum-atom basis. This demonstration will solidify the ability to translate this platform to a much broader materials space and set of reactions, which can impact businesses and industries globally.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will provide the medical field with a broad response detector capable of pairing with cheaper disease diagnostic tools for improved healthcare.  Currently, there is not a commercially available broadband detector that can capture visible light and near infrared light.  The Phase I SBIR effort will lead to an advanced detector capable of spanning this light range and fulfilling this unmet need.  As a commercial product, this detector can be used in multiple commercial sectors including unmanned vehicles, the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.  For example, in the medical field the ideal light for tissue penetration is between visible and near infrared.  The detector developed in this project would permit optical scans of human bodies for disease diagnosis.  The optical scan will provide a cheaper and safer alternative in comparison to expensive MRI technology and high-energy sources, such as x-rays, that result in radiological exposure.  The size of the global medical imaging market is currently valued at $16 billion and the proposed work would help healthcare services in rural areas have access to optical diagnosing services.

    Semiconductor-based detectors are limited to absorbing photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the electronic band gap of the semiconductor.  As a result, there is not a commercially available detector that can span 400-2200nm with fast detection.  The expected outcome of this project is a single broadband detector, based off of the quantum spin Seebeck effect to generate a spin current, that can span 400-2200nm with a flat quantum efficiency and a high response time.  The quantum efficiency (QE) of the patent-protected detector is almost three orders of magnitude lower than semiconductor-based detectors and the largest portion of the project is devoted to improving the QE to commercial levels.  The project will accomplish the following goals: 1) prove the feasibility of increasing the quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, 2) make a readout circuit board, 3) show detector capabilities through building a benchtop-working prototype, and 4) design a compact prototype to be built during Phase II. As a commercial product, this detector can be used in unmanned vehicles, in the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF?s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.

    This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will help address the major concerns of climate change and sustainability of arable lands. The two common methods of weed control in the agricultural industry, herbicides and soil tillage, have a negative impact on the environment and soil sustainability. The health of the microbial environment in the soil is degraded by the use of herbicides and soil tillage. In addition, soil tillage exposes the organic matter in the soil to oxidation releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goal for reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate is to sequester the carbon in the soil and not release it. At this time, the only option for weed control of mid to late stage weeds without the use of herbicides or soil tillage is manual labor, which is more expensive. The successful development and testing of the precision weeder extraction tool will give the agricultural industry an automated and cost effective option for addressing weed control while helping to reduce the carbon emission from the soil and protect soil sustainability.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector extraction tool that can remove weeds without using chemicals or soil tillage. Advances in machine vision have made it possible to identify the individual plants in a field and determine which plant is the crop and which one is the weed. Presently, the two predominant methods used by automated weeders to kill the weeds is either by a targeted herbicide spray or soil tillage. Both of these methods negatively impact the environment and soil health. The proposed precision weeder will extract and dispose of the weeds without damage to the soil or environment. The economics of weeding will require the device to be simple, cost effective, reliable, and field hardened. Design and development of the extraction tool will use a new and novel method for removing the weeds with advances in design and actuation. The extraction tool will be tested in the field to determine its feasibility. Successful field trials will convince the customer and investor that this is a viable option for commercial automated weeding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is its innovative and potentially transformative contribution to assistive technologies for infants with motor impairment. In the United States, over 40,000 infants per year are born with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down syndrome, that often result in motor impairment. There is currently no device that provides independent movement to infants with motor limitations. Since children learn a great deal about their physical and social environments when they begin to crawl/walk, conditions that deny or delay independent movement can impact cognitive, language, and social development. A device that will let these infants move and explore at the same age as other children could mitigate these developmental delays and facilitate full integration into society.  Lifetime cost of healthcare for these children has been estimated at $250,000. Providing early independent movement could result in a potential $50,000 lifetime reduction in additional interventions such, as behavioral and occupational therapy, special education, and the need for healthcare and educational aides.  This amounts to over $200,000,000 in savings per year to the health and education systems.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need, expressed by parents and therapists, for a device that will allow infants with motor impairment to move independently at the same age as their typically developing peers. Currently, no such device is available.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is the development of a novel control method for a powered device that can be used by infants as young as 6 months old:  The device moves in the direction that the infant leans (as when reaching toward a toy or parent) while preventing collisions and falls.  Previous research has shown that infants as young as five months old can learn to use this control method to purposefully steer a powered device in all directions. The research objectives of this project are to build and validate a second-generation prototype that can be used by parents and clinicians outside of a research setting. Successful completion of these objectives will advance the device from a research testbed to a viable, if limited, prototype, enabling future work to evaluate the impact of the device on the development of cognitive, social, and communication skills for infants with disabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the burden of accessing information for the 1.5 million blind people in the United States by making a full page of refreshable braille text and tactile graphics available in a device resembling a tablet computer. This assistive technology will provide increased access to braille in digital form and enable blind students to read, with their fingers, digitized spatial content including mathematical equations, graphs, and figures, creating parity with their sighted counterparts interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In particular, the product with supporting software will remove barriers to collaboration in classroom learning environments and document preparation in the workplace. The proposed product will improve braille literacy, increase opportunities to enter careers in STEM, and ultimately lead to the employment success and independence of blind Americans.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues efforts to adopt microfluidic technology in order to create a highly manufacturable full-page braille and tactile graphics display that uses pneumatic signals to actuate pins at braille spacing. The anticipated technical innovations shift certain drive functions from electromechanical hardware to the more cost effective and easily manufactured multilayered microfluidic substrate. Since the ultimate objective for this phase of research is to create an integrated system for delivering interactive braille and tactile graphics, the team will focus on designing the interactive experience by which blind users access, on demand, the textual and non-textual information that they desire. The anticipated outcome of this project is a seamless array of actuated pins in a tablet­ sized device capable of presenting a half­ page of braille characters and tactile graphic images.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind?s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot?s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot?s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to enhance scientific and technological understanding in selective harvesting of high-value crops such as strawberry. The innovation proposed here will be a key component in creating a compact economically viable autonomous strawberry harvesting robot. The technology developed in this project will help address the farming labor shortage which is experienced by farmers more and more each year. Agricultural robotics market is estimated to be $11.9 billion by 2026. Providing autonomous harvesting robots will enable farmers to grow more crops with less business risks related to manual labor shortages and will ensure that US farmers remain competitive, while creating more skilled, highly paid jobs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop critical technologies for delicate selective harvesting of fragile crops such as strawberries at a competitive pace. Recent advancements in computer vision object detection and three-dimensional scene reconstruction will be used to create near real-time operational scenes. Those scenes will be used to detect ripe berries, create a movement path and navigate the fast and precise robot arm for harvesting the berries without damaging fruits while avoiding obstacles.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to introduce a cost-effective way of crop protection from fungal spoilage. Every year, 25% of the food produced by the world is wasted due to fungal infections and contamination of crops with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The combined social, environmental, and economic global annual cost of this food wastage is >$2T. The proposed innovation is centered on harnessing an untapped bacterium to bring a new line of affordable antifungals to a broad base of crop growers across the United States, which are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing preharvest postharvest treatment protocols. The products are quick and easy to manufacture without costly purification procedures. They should be safe for the environment and human health and have a defined mechanism of action. As a result, billions of dollars? worth of crops, energy, and resources could be saved, leading to increased agricultural sustainability and economic competitiveness of the United States. It may also advance the health and welfare of the American public by enhancing food safety. Finally, it can pave the way for other innovations to combat fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation by developing the first product, safeguarding corn crops from fungal spoilage during both preharvest and postharvest. Corn is the most planted crop in the United States. Every year, the corn industry loses >$1B due to infection with a fungus (Aspergillus flavus), resulting in contamination of the crop with a carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. The critical technical objectives during the project period will be to (1) identify the functional components of the product and demonstrate their mode of action; (2) assess the amounts of those components that can be produced per unit mass of bacterial biomass, (3) determine an optimal formulation of the minimal viable product that can be most effective in preventing fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination in the corn crop, and (4) conduct an optimal toxicity profiling of the minimal viable product. Upon completion, the knowledge obtained will provide valuable insights for effective intellectual protection and regulatory strategy for the products from the technology and identify any potential challenges related to scalability, consistency, and product shelf-life, which will determine the costs and logistics for large-scale manufacturing of the products.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable discovery of needed T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapeutics for late-stage cancer patients who have limited treatment options. These immunotherapies work by leveraging T-cells engineered with TCRs that will identify and destroy cancer cells that naturally present a marker (antigen) specific to the cancer on their surface (e.g., cancer mutations). This project will develop a high-throughput platform capable of screening many thousands of TCRs against many thousands of antigens to identify clinically relevant TCRs. This project could impact society?s health by discovering TCRs that will serve as the basis for treatments against currently incurable cancers. The commercial impacts are potentially large. The total market size of T-cell therapeutics was $2.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $8.5 billion by 2027. The platform described by this proposal has the potential to discover many TCR based therapeutics, creating value for patient and society at large.

    The proposed project is to develop a platform for identifying clinically valuable TCRs. This platform could be critical for developing new immunotherapies against solid tumors and for understanding the biology that underlies TCR-antigen interaction. Screening thousands of TCRs for functional activation against thousands of antigens is challenging due to the difficulty of tracking interactions between hundreds of thousands of unique cells. The proposed platform and method links T-cell activation with phagocytosis using engineered T-macrophage and antigen presenting cell (APC) lines. T-macrophages engulf APCs as directed by TCR activation, capturing evidence of an interaction within the T-macrophage. The resulting interactions can be read from the T-macrophages via single-cell sequencing. The objective of this project is to produce large cell-based libraries for TCR and antigens and to identify interacting TCR-antigen pairs. The antigen library will include hundreds of clinically relevant cancer targets, such as KRAS and TP53. These results will demonstrate the feasibility of our platform.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the positive effect it will have in the classroom, and ultimately, on school dropouts. Dropouts face bleak economic futures, are more likely to commit a crime and be incarcerated, suffer poor health, and exact a financial toll on society. Since dropping out of school is a gradual process of a student becoming disengaged in the classroom, the proposed project will address school dropout at the most elemental level. At the end of this project, the development team will have an innovative, web-based game that will transform the classroom dynamic, in any school, and give teachers meaningful analytics so they can better meet their student?s needs, keep them engaged in the learning process, and reduce the number of kids dropping out of school. The innovative platform has the potential raise the learning opportunities for marginalized learners and stimulate positive societal change.


    The intellectual merit of this project is in the quantitative measurement and tracking of student engagement and production of a longitudinal analysis for each student, so teachers can track engagement throughout an entire quarter, semester, or year.  The solution will empower instructors to make more well-informed decisions for their classrooms. The research will focus on converting the original composite, laborious, pen, paper, and spreadsheet version of the tool into a web-based version that integrates with teacher lessons while accommodating diverse content areas and a multitude of teaching styles. As students interact with the web-based, gamified lesson delivery platform, they can earn or lose virtual dollars while learning valuable soft skills such as such as responsibility, critical thinking, and work ethics, including financial literacy skills such as online banking, investing, using credit, and budgeting. This project will harness the game platform quality to capture students' attention and generate motivation to invest time and energy into learning. In the process, the game will collect valuable learning metrics and provide reports and analytics for teachers so they can learn more about their students. The goal of the proposed project is to develop the minimum viable product and test pilot its efficacy.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in creating an independent. assistive Braille learning device for blind people. The ability to read Braille is highly correlated with improved independence and quality of life. An estimated 70% of the blind are unemployed yet, of that subpopulation that is Braille literate, only 10% are unemployed. There is a Braille literacy crisis - only 8.5% of the blind population in the US can read Braille today, compared to 50% in the 1960s. There are several factors theorized to contribute to increasing Braille illiteracy including: 1) a shortage of teachers qualified to teach Braille, 2) negative outlooks on the difficulty and cost of Braille learning, and 3) and difficulties integrating blind students into mainstream schools that don?t have the specialized resources for this population. The results of this project will assist students of all ages in learning how to read Braille, including secondary Braille learners who become blind later in life. Aiming at inhibiting the Braille literacy crisis, the technology enables the blind to be given the same opportunities as their sighted peers, including better chances at graduating from high school and college, obtaining employment, and having high independence levels.


    The intellectual merit of this project is in development of a wearable, computer vision-based, real-time Braille-to-speech learning device. While the primary mission of the project is to unlock the full potential of blind individuals through Braille literacy, the overall goal for the technology is to unlock the full potential of human touch with computer-assisted augmentation cues in response to intricate textural patterns. The proposed technology will detect such patterns in a contactless approach, preserving the integrity of the material, and provide auditory feedback in real-time to allow for mechanosensory-augmented feedback. This project focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of such an approach by: 1) determining if the device and interpreting algorithms can be made robust to environmental and user postural variations, 2) developing capabilities to perform well on textured and/or patterned surfaces, and 3) conducting usability testing to identify areas of the user experience that must be enhanced in the future to be viable in the market with two vital stakeholders - Braille tutors and Braille students. These goals, if completed successfully, will not only impact Braille learners but also open up other market applications for this technology such as manufacturing and medicine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a semiconductor laser technology based on laterally confined photonic crystal cavities. The proposed laser technology may ensure secure semiconductor and microelectronic supply chains within US for energy-efficient high-capacity data center link capabilities, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous driving/aerial vehicles, high performance communication and sensing systems, etc. The novel solution may accelerate technology development, address technical and market gaps, and foster entrepreneurship with important social impacts. The project will help prepare a diversified workforce skilled in semiconductor production, nanotechnology, photonics and optics, and advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize high speed photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSELs) with single-mode, high power output. PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this project centers on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals suffering from motor dysfunction due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and other conditions. In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks. Additional results include increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and turn-over.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of exoskeleton robots targeted at rehabilitation. A substantial portion of the US population requires intensive rehabilitation services for neuromuscular impairment. Robotic rehabilitation has attracted attention due to the potential for better patient outcomes. Current robotic solutions lack the anatomical mobility and compliant dynamic behavior to produce neurologically-sound therapeutic behaviors. The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior. In this project, the physical structures and control algorithms of the exoskeletons will be designed and built with a focus on dynamic transparency and kinematic compatibility with the human body to capitalize on the capabilities of the actuator. Additionally, the control software will use feedback loops and a visually interactive environment with performance metrics to keep patients engaged.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a safe, effective, and sustainably-produced natural sunscreen compound, gadusol, to replace harmful ingredients widely used in current sunscreen products. Two to three million cases of skin cancer are reported globally each year, including 132,000 cases of melanoma. In 2015, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reported 80,442 new cases of melanomas of the skin in the U.S. The potential exists to reverse this trend with effective, safe, aesthetically-pleasing sun protection products that provided long-lasting full-spectrum UV protection. Sustainable production of gadusol and the assurance of its safety and efficacy will enable such products to be developed. With a global sunscreen product market of $16.5 billion and growing, along with the demonstrated need for natural, safer sunscreen actives, this project is poised to have a worldwide, long-term impact on national and global health.

    This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of sustainably producing gadusol, a natural, marine-based compound with proven sun protection capability.  Recent research has documented that widely used sunscreen ingredients pose hazards to the environment and possibly to human health, leading to bans on popular sunscreen products. Mineral active compounds such as ZnO and TiO2 are safer substitutes but pose aesthetic disadvantages, leading to products that many consumers dislike. Gadusol has the potential to replace some of these widely-used chemical actives as a safe, effective, and natural UVB blocker. The technical scope proposed includes overcoming obstacles to sustainable production of gadusol using the tools of synthetic biology, establishing gadusol's safety through standard pre-clinical tests, and assessing its efficacy and suitability in prototype formulations (SPF value). Successful completion of this project will reduce the risks of adopting gadusol as a new sunscreen ingredient, enable its commercial production, and provide essential safety data prior to initiating clinical testing required for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the redefinition of the care of asthma patients. Asthma is highly prevalent in the US, with 25 million patients currently suffering symptoms, and was the cause of 1.7 million emergency room visits in 2015, resulting in a huge societal cost. A predictive platform that can identify when a patient is at risk of an asthma attack would serve to reduce such costs by allowing intervention in a timely manner, thereby reducing the number of emergency room visits by asthma patients. Through the combination of remote monitoring of patient lung function, local environmental sensing, and data analytics, asthma can be understood at a personalized scale, a dramatic shift in the standard of care for this chronic and complex condition. Additionally, the platform developed in this project can be expanded to other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or cystic fibrosis, broadening its impact. Ultimately, it is envisioned that this project will result in a world without asthma attacks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the development of a machine learning-based data analytics platform to identify in advance when asthma patients are at risk of an asthma attack, thereby enabling physicians to alter a patient's care plan and avoid hospitalization. To date, there is no integrated system to gather and analyze high-quality lung function and environmental data for asthma patients on a daily basis in order to truly analyze and predict a patient's health. As a result, asthma care is often reactive, requiring emergency treatment and resulting in poor clinical outcomes. The objectives of this Phase II research include the development and validation of a machine-learning based analytics model to generate new insights into the health of asthma patients; the development and implementation of a physician portal to translate such insights into clinical outcomes; and the development of new datasets to create a more robust and accurate platform. The result will be a live prediction platform to assist physicians in keeping asthma patients out of the emergency room.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve early detection and clinical management of bacteremia in patients suspected of bacterial sepsis. Over 250,000 patients die of sepsis each year in the U.S., which results in hospitalization costs exceeding $20 billion. A sepsis patient?s risk of death has been demonstrated to increase by 4-7% per hour, where timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is expected to improve patient survival. Unfortunately, the standard of care approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility requires overnight culturing that can take a day or more. Currently, broad spectrum antibiotics are administered within the first hour of treatment with the hope that the pathogen will be susceptible, while waiting for antibiotic susceptibility results. The growing landscape of antibiotic resistance severely undermines the efficacy of the standard approach, as many pathogens are increasingly resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This project seeks to advance development of a novel optical approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility results within 1 hour to support the use of appropriate antibiotics, which has significant potential to improve patient mortality outcomes and reduce hospitalization costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an optical technology for the rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility results from a blood sample for patients suspected of bacteremia. The product uses an assay for assessment of bacterial metabolism, where a blood specimen may be cultured with and without antibiotics to determine antibiotic susceptibility. Advancements in the assay and microfluidics enable delivery of antibiotic susceptibility results within one hour. This timeframe would enable clinicians to use antibiotics that are targeted to the patient?s specific bacterial pathogen significantly earlier, which is expected to improve patient outcomes. The goal of this project will be to rigorously demonstrate the proof-of-concept and reproducibility of the technology.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a highly effective and long-acting implantable contraceptive for the 61 million American women in their childbearing years (ages 15 to 44), 70% of whom are at risk for unintended pregnancies. Unintended pregnancies accounted for half of the total pregnancies in 2022, and over 60% of unplanned pregnancies end in abortion, with an estimated 45% of abortions being unsafe, resulting in 5-13% of all maternal fatalities. Today, an estimated 7.5 million women aged 15?49 receive a treatment or hormonal drug via long-term subcutaneous arm implants. Once they reach the end of their lifespan, these implants must be removed, and complications can quickly arise. Not only are these procedures expensive, but they leave behind heavy bruising and scarring and some instances even require an operation for removal. The proposed product is the world?s first biodegradable contraceptive-releasing implant. The technology combines  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved material with a generic drug already on the market. It uses novel manufacturing methods and biodegradable materials, eliminating the need for implant removal and enabling the proper timing and therapeutic dosage. This novel delivery drug technology can be applied to different drug treatments in a sustainable and affordable manner.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the future of long-acting reversible contraception by creating a biodegradable arm implant that delivers a consistent hormone dose and does not have to be surgically removed. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to characterize the drug delivery scaffold and demonstrate its utility. This project will de-risk the prototype to be used in Pre-Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) studies required by the FDA. The Phase I strategy will be two-fold: (1) de-risking operations by finalizing the prototype after evaluating the physical and chemical properties and (2) test the long-acting contraception implant prototype in a clinically relevant biological model to provide the necessary data for a successful IND launch. Progress of this project will provide a solid foundation for advancing the biodegradable contraception product toward commercial utility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterial into a commercial-ready product and address volumetric muscle loss injuries. In the context of defense medicine, severe muscle trauma often occurs in environments where external factors such as sterility are not well-controlled. This project is expected to demonstrate antimicrobial properties of this novel muscle-regenerating biomaterial to enable use in these environments. If successful, the broader societal and economic impacts of antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterials are staggering. Volumetric muscle loss affects tens of millions of victims each year. Sixty percent of patients are left untreated, 30% receive a muscle flap transplant, and 10% of injured limbs are amputated. Total average lifetime costs for amputation now total over $700,000. Improved clinical outcomes resulting from the implementation of this technology could lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings over the course of each recipient's lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates significant advances over the existing standard of care for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss, for which no treatment currently exists. The joint loss of cells and extracellular matrix creates an environment where muscle regeneration cannot occur, leading to muscle collapse and atrophy over time. This project effectively replaces the extracellular matrix lost in volumetric muscle loss and creates an environment where satellite cells may proliferate and differentiate into new muscle tissue. A technical concern raised by clinicians, especially those who work in austere environments in military medicine, is the risk of infection caused by implanting a foreign substance into a wound bed. To address this, Technical Objective 1 will focus on incorporating antibacterial agents to optimize the scaffold?s ability to promote muscle regeneration while also having an antibacterial effect. Structural and mechanical properties will be assessed, cellular viability ensured, muscle cell quality evaluated, and antibacterial properties measured. Technical Objective 2 aims to investigate these outcomes with a pilot porcine model of muscle trauma. It is anticipated that the proposed antimicrobial biomaterial will both combat the risk of infection and effectively regenerate functional muscle in traumatic muscle injuries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project pertains to the critical need for pharmacologic treatments in large populations that suffer from coronary artery disease and that are subjected to procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery. While effective in correcting the reduced flow of blood to the heart tissue, these interventions also cause tissue damage categorized as ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). A pharmacologic treatment is critically needed to address this residual injury that is a major cause of rehospitalization, prolonged hospital-stay, heart failure, and mortality. By deploying the proposed technology of heart-targeted vehicle for drug delivery, it will be possible to achieve effective cardioprotection, which will reduce patient distress and economic burden on the healthcare system for patients undergoing reperfusion procedures. This disruptive technology will impact myocardial reperfusion injury market worth $1.6 billion and influence the standard of care for over 1 million coronary artery disease patients that are treated by angioplasty or bypass surgery each year in the United States.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop Cardiotropic Atorvastatin Liposomes (CATLIP) to deliver cardioprotective benefits of atorvastatin to the heart, safely and effectively. The innovative CATLIP technology will deliver therapeutic amounts of atorvastatin to the heart tissue for treatment of IRI. Current methods of administration are inadequate in reaching the drug concentration needed for clinical efficacy. Serving a long-term goal of developing a myocardia-targeted treatment to mitigate IRI, the research objective of this proof-of-principle project is to attain effective delivery of atorvastatin in the heart tissue. CATLIP?s targeting approach is based on a small molecule targeting vector that selectively binds to the cardiomyosin exposed in the injured heart tissue. The research team will prepare and characterize liposomes loaded with atorvastatin and modified on the surface with the cardiotropic targeting vector. This preparation will be tested in an animal model of myocardial infraction to determine atorvastatin delivery in the heart tissue. Successful implementation of this project will create a proprietary product for treatment of IRI of the heart and demonstrate the potential of a targeting technology for application with other drugs for the same medical condition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is further advancement and maturation of a recently devised miniature electromechanical actuator technology with potential applications in the consumer electronics, automotive and biomedical industries.  Any electrically powered system with moving parts requires actuators converting electrical energy into mechanical motion.  This includes robots, surgical/medical micro-devices, precision micro/nano-positioning systems, and optical and ultrasonic imaging systems among others.  The market size for millimeter-scale electromechanical actuators embedded in compact camera modules (CCM) for Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Auto-Focusing (AF) alone is currently over $3B and expected to reach over $5B by 2025.  The same actuator technology can also be applied to a variety of other applications such as compact speakers, ultrasonic transducers, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project utilizes the newly established cellular electrostatic actuator technology to demonstrate a low cost, power efficient, high-performance solution for auto-focusing and optical image stabilization in compact camera modules.  Physical movement of the lens stack with respect to the image sensor is essential in cameras for Auto-Focusing (AF) as well as shake cancellation via Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).  Voice Coil Motors (VCM) currently used to address such functionalities are relatively bulky, slow, power hungry, and costly.  Enabled by the state-of-the-art micromachining techniques, force generating ultra-narrow electrostatic gaps within the proposed actuators offer high work output per volume with close to 100% energy efficiency.  Under this project, for realization of a viable product prototype, mechanical displacement amplifiers and shock absorbing structures will be designed and integrated within the silicon chips along with the actuators.  Comprehensive mechanical shock tests on loaded actuators as well as long-term electrical reliability and mechanical durability tests will be performed on the fabricated prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable electronic products of great environmental benefit and social value which cannot be economically made today. Among these are three important product classes that can deliver on the promise of the connection of everyday devices via internet (Internet of Things) and their rapid computing power. First, wearable devices (such as smart watches, health monitors, or activity trackers) must be smaller, thinner (often flexible) and less power-hungry than current versions. Second, low-power, high resolution displays with high brightness are needed to visualize results, even in direct sunlight. Third, the decentralized computers which collect, manage and process large datasets require designs that can easily manage sensors, process information, and control devices to support smart cities, smart vehicles, smart homes, and smart applications. The primary focus of this project is to enable the next generation of advanced displays, capable of substantial energy savings coupled with greater visual appeal. Broadly, the results are critical for enabling the cost-effective manufacturing of each of the three product classes, which all suffer from fundamental challenges in chip manufacturing and require innovation in packaging and assembly to be commercially viable at scale.

    The proposed project is designed primarily to make better displays possible. There is a widespread desire to make displays with ultrasmall light-emitting diodes (LEDs), enabling better contrast and color, sunlight viewability, longer lifetimes, lower power consumption, and lower cost. To do so, currently unsolved chip fabrication obstacles must be overcome. The main impediment is a cost-effective approach to place such small LEDs at desired pixel positions with adequate precision. The objective of the project is to meet this need, using a unique non-contact photopolymer-based method which transfers <10 um die with +/- 2 um accuracy at many thousands of units per second with high yield. The research will involve systematic study of the parameters of the process, including polymer composition and characteristics, film characteristics, pre-transfer bonding process parameters (temperature, pressure and time), and optical system parameters. Yield will be measured statistically and improved. While demonstrating actual throughput requires full-scale production equipment, the feasibility of meeting industry required targets will be demonstrated to the extent possible on lab-scale equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to democratize participation in the expansive growth of blockchain-enabled financial markets that increasingly require the ability to read, analyze, or write smart contracts at scale. Enterprises that lack the programming capabilities to perform these tasks well will become increasingly disadvantaged as smart contracts continue to proliferate. Ranging from simple Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that convey ownership to complex, self-executing agreements that automate future payments, smart contracts are at the heart of the commercial utility and perceived value of a blockchain. Growing numbers of financial institutions are seeking to advance their Web3 capabilities, even at premium prices. As algorithmic trading has demonstrated, automating analysis and execution can provide enormous commercial upside, yet it also can result in large losses if designed improperly or left unchecked. Pioneering a solution that enables enterprises without advanced programmers to reap the benefits of analyzing and writing smart contracts while managing the associated risks requires deep technology? specifically a novel visual programming language designed to manage big-data sets involving millions of smart contracts on public blockchains using simple no-code commands.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to build a unique blockchain application interface that will enable users to scan and read smart contracts and immediately leverage the extracted data to design, build, and test trading algorithms that incorporate digital assets. This interface will ultimately enable users to analyze and write smart contracts at scale without the need to code. The project will set the foundation for the inexpensive development of Web3 capabilities by thousands of enterprises that do not have access to advanced programmers. The project will also produce a computerized tool that does the following two key tasks:  1. continuously scan publicly-accessible smart contracts in real time, and 2.  derive indicators from these scanned contracts that likely are meaningful, initially for the purposes of analyzing and trading financial assets. The blockchain application interface to be created will enable users without programming capabilities to automate trading using live smart contract data for the first time.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the performance and accountability of capital projects which have significant economic and social impact. Large capital projects, such as infrastructure and energy, have long-term benefits to economies, affect local communities, and have geopolitical implications. Projects in important sectors such as defense, science, and healthcare often suffer massive cost and time overruns, making efficient and verifiable project execution highly beneficial. These projects are very complex and challenging to manage; they require multiple internal stakeholders to work together and affect many external communities. The proposed solution is a platform that enables self-regulating project networks and integrates schedules, contracts, and information flow across companies. This platform will be based on distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, making them transparent, efficient, and secure. The proposed solution will create a new, reliable, measurable paradigm for capital projects and allow multiple companies to collaboratively plan and collectively build them. It will also aid regulatory oversight, and projects will include all stakeholders. The platform will be revolutionary for complex projects planning and building, significantly improving cost and schedule performance, and bringing greater accountability to the multi-trillion dollar capital project market.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform using blockchain technology that improves the performance and accountability of capital projects. The technology will enable significantly improved transparency, while making projects more cost and schedule efficient. The platform will result in more responsive and responsible symbiotic project ecosystems and advance the application of directed, acyclic, graph based distributed ledger technology to multi-party enterprise workflows. The collaborative governance platform will enable self-regulating project networks of authenticated stakeholders, utilizing a consensus-based single-source-of-truth, and automate contract execution and value exchange. The platform will synchronize schedules, contracts, and payments into one system with verifiable consensus across all participants. The technology will incentivize project performance by mitigating the effects of complexity and enable artificial intelligence and machine learning applications for projects by providing verifiable data. The focus will be on developing the architecture and business model of the platform.  The team will conduct market research to identify the primary commercial consumers and potential revenue streams. The project will build a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the platform. The anticipated results include a functional prototype of the platform and a validated business model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel product for ensuring proper visualization through intraoperative scopes during laparoscopic procedures. Worldwide, 13 million laparoscopic surgeries are performed each year. Surgeons require proper visualization of the operating site which entails continually wiping the lens, reinserting the scope, relocating the surgical site, and then resuming the surgery. This difficulty in visualization results in the need to temporarily halt the operation and potentially lose critical focus of the surgical area in order to restore the surgical field of view. Surgeons repeat this process an average of six times per hour, accounting for nearly 1/3 of the operating time. This time delay results in an estimated loss of 336,000 hours of operating room procedure time and $1.25 billion in productivity losses in the United States alone each year.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will develop operating prototypes of a novel, flexible, micro-mechanical mechanism with multiple degrees of freedom. The device integrates flexible and conforming mechanisms with a wiping blade to enable real time wiping of surgical scopes and ports. This technology enables surgeons to quickly and intraoperatively re-enable laparoscope vision within the patient. The technical challenges of the project include the development of a computational engineering model that optimizes user control of off-axis stiffness, force response, and stress.  The team will also need to ensure the solution has sufficient fatigue life and predictable mechanical response throughout the duration of the procedure. Computational engineering models will be used to design and develop several manufacturable prototypes, which will be tested and validated with several currently available laparoscopes.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its positive influence on both the growth of the Low Earth Orbit economy and stimulation of innovation in space technology. The growing demand for satellite launches is currently limited by a bottleneck of low availability, flexibility, and high cost of existing orbital launch services. Orbital delivery services enabled by this advanced in-flight separation system will enable a new level of launch responsiveness leading to lower costs, much greater contractual flexibility, and the availability of daily launches without the need for costly launch infrastructure, greatly accelerating time-to-market for satellite service providers and increasing their profitability. Low cost and frequent access to Low Earth Orbit will enable ubiquitous internet access, 5G capabilities, and valuable Earth observation technologies. The flexibility and reduced cost of these launch services will help maintain the United States' position at the forefront of space technology development and space research. The technology will provide the US Armed Forces access to a responsive, secure, flexible, and available gateway to space that will boost reconnaissance, observation, communication, and intelligence capabilities. Moreover, it will represent the most ecofriendly launch delivery service available, able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by three times (3x) compared to ground launch.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate an innovative concept of in-flight aircraft/rocket separation in which the rocket is launched from the top of the carrier aircraft, instead of the widely used launch from beneath. This new separation system is the core innovation enabling an advanced air-launched orbital delivery system that will dramatically reduce the cost of dedicated satellite launch, minimize propulsion and structural requirements, and enable orbital delivery flexibility and precision, while significantly reducing the carbon footprint of space launch operations. The proposed concept will be the first top-carry air-launch service commercially available. The goals of the Phase I project are focused on building a prototype of the separation system and validating it in a sub-orbital test flight. The main technical challenge is to ensure that the design of the improved separation system will work under a broad range of real flight conditions. This technology will be achieved by research leading to a better understanding of aerodynamic behavior at the separation event and the development of an improved design methodology that considers all relevant design parameters and their aerodynamic effects.

    \ Research (SBIR) project is to address the need for recycling plastics that have\
    \ surpassed their useful life. The ?plastic?s revolution? of the mid-twentieth\
    \ century has greatly added value to society but has also created highly durable\
    \ plastics that are used to make objects of limited life-expectancy. There are\
    \ limited cost-effective alternatives to many of these polymers. Every day, 8\
    \ million pieces of plastic are thrown into the ocean amounting to 10 million\
    \ tons per year. Although there are approaches to decompose or depolymerize the\
    \ polymers used in common plastic parts, these methods are not generally efficient\
    \ across the dimensions of cost, energy use, time for degradation, or scalability.\
    \ An extreme example of the need for energy and time efficient depolymerization\
    \ of polymers is in space missions. There is a very high cost of disposing solids\
    \ in earth?s orbit and removing space-junk which must be monitored and avoided\
    \ by orbiting satellites. Even more challenging is the need for reusable materials\
    \ during extended space missions due to the lack of raw materials.\t\n\nThis SBIR\
    \ Phase I project proposes to develop a polymer-based plastics technology that\
    \ allows for rapid, low-energy, triggerable disposal of plastics when a space\
    \ mission has been completed. This project also proposes to carry out the disposal\
    \ of plastics so that the products can extend their value and be recycled to make\
    \ the same or different objects in space. Closing the polymer-carbon cycle has\
    \ potential to extend space missions, lower the amount of supply materials needed,\
    \ and reduce the amount of orbiting space junk. This project is developing a unique\
    \ family of polymers which can be easily depolymerized back to the starting monomers\
    \ via a photo or thermal trigger. The polymers are composed of cyclic, low ceiling\
    \ temperature polymers. The low ceiling temperature means that once a single chemical\
    \ bond in the polymer is broken, two ends are formed which instantaneously lead\
    \ to depolymerization of the entire polymer molecule back to its original monomers.\
    \  The depolymerized monomers can be evaporated to make the plastic parts ?disappear?\
    \ or can be captured and used to repolymerize a new plastic component. This project\
    \ will develop specific depolymerization triggers and a continuous-flow polymerization\
    \ reactor for synthesizing plastic parts in space (and elsewhere for on-earth\
    \ applications).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a new, non-rocket based thrust technology capable of removing debris from space. This project will provide two separate business models including hardware fabrication and testing, and active orbital debris removal services. Six Department of Defense (DoD) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO)SSO spacecraft have broken up in high-value low earth orbits since 2000, and the US Space Force tracks over 550 pieces of NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 debris objects (>10cm). This technology provides solutions to help remove such problematic debris from space. The technology will be designed for beneficial use by both US Government agencies and commercial space companies. The proposed vehicle fleet production is expected to enable efficient deorbit services for removal from space.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative method for Earth orbit transfer, called a Hyper Transfer Vehicle (HTV). HTV is a non-rocket technology that solves performance limitations of in-space rocket thrusters. HTV offers reusable and economically sustainable orbital space debris removal solutions across all earth operational orbits. This proposal addresses the space debris problem not caused by operational satellites, but from non-maneuverable objects and debris in the highly populated Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO). Historically, SSO space objects have contributed to technical, societal, and scientific advancements. The potential outcome of HTV research is a viable and reusable technology for cost-effective orbit object disposal in high value SSO with clean Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP). Instead of expelling propellant, HTV rotates a working fluid gas inside a toroidal cavity to generate a usable force. HTV torus structure draws in the gas while mounted inside an ambient pressure enclosure, which is separate from the vacuum of space. HTV generates a reactive force by employing the Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). CAM is preserved when HTV fluid angular momentum (H) and rotational energy (Trot) change. This project will demonstrate with experimental measurements an external force by using air as the working fluid gas, while satisfying CAM.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project entails the development of a simple and affordable saliva-based test that will enable the detection of early Alzheimer's disease. Today, there is no single test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Because the diagnosis is complex, invasive, and expensive, these tests are only performed once symptoms, such as memory loss, begin to manifest. These symptoms of Alzheimer's disease only become apparent once the disease has already cause significant damage to the brain. The proposed test will be widely accessible and detect the disease before symptoms arise, enabling the patient to start active prevention strategies and even therapies to preserve brain health. As the American population ages ? nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 years of age or older by 2060 ? Alzheimer?s disease and other dementias are becoming a great challenge for health and social care. As part of a broad approach to prevention, this technology can potentially extend early Alzheimer?s care to millions of Americans, allowing interventions, monitoring, and treatment initiation years earlier than what is currently possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is applying sophisticated chemical analysis methods to develop a novel test to detect signs of early Alzheimer?s disease using a person?s saliva. Diseases can cause changes in the biochemical composition of body fluids such as blood or saliva. Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer?s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer?s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a lightweight, ultra-compact 3D sensor offering enhanced performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. Existing sensors on consumer electronic devices, such as those on augmented/virtual reality headsets, are limited in their perception accuracy and detection range resulting in a poor user experience, which has limited their implementation. The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities. This effort also supports domestic photonics manufacturing and assembly industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seeks to develop a novel 3D sensor design that promises performance enhancement over state-of-the-art devices. Building on a proprietary flat optics technology, the project may lead to a 3D sensor module featuring panoramic vision, significant spatial resolution improvements, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and a compact, lightweight architecture amenable to low-cost manufacturing and assembly. The project has two main goals: 1) demonstration of a 3D sensor prototype and experimental validation of its performance and 2) development of scalable manufacturing routes for fabrication of flat optics components leveraging standard microfabrication technologies.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to increase the competitiveness of the US in manufacturing high value parts for shops with high product variety, low volumes, large lead times, and large set up times.  The application addresses a need to find the optimal way of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries.  The technology may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers more cost competitive.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times, and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to accelerate the transition from chemical pesticides to non-chemical alternatives by providing farmers with a sustainable, long-term solution for managing pests, while reducing agricultural impacts on human health and the environment. Today, strawberry farmers are reliant on chemical pesticides, spending $2,500/acre on over 60,000 acres/year to support the $3.6 billion U.S. strawberry industry. Organic farms, representing 10% of the industry, lack effective treatment methods resulting in high labor costs and increased risk of yield loss. This project seeks to develop a system for using ultraviolet light as an efficient and equally effective alternative for chemical pesticides, disrupting the pesticide manufacturing industry by providing farmers with a healthier and more environmentally conscious method for treating crops. The solution may eliminate uncertainty associated with chemical applications, reduce labor requirements, and increase profitability for farmers. Additionally, technologies developed as part of this project will minimize human exposure to chemical pesticides and reduce the ecological damage caused by existing agricultural treatment practices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel, non-chemical treatment system for commercialization of agricultural pest control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical pesticides, a global $84 billion market. Existing pest controls are ineffective due to insect resistance, cause uncertainty, and result in reduced yield and profitability. This project?s objective is to create a reliable, non-chemical treatment alternative that uses ultraviolet (UV-C) light to control multiple pests effectively and sustainably. The project team will build a UV-C treatment device with a dosing control algorithm for achieving reliable pest control in minimum treatment time.

    \ Phase II project seeks to develop an improved era of infectious disease management,\
    \ allowing rapid intervention for antibiotic therapy to stem the 30% mortality\
    \ rate and associated cost impact of sepsis. With some 49 million cases worldwide\
    \ and a 25-30% mortality rate, sepsis claims 11 million lives annually. Sepsis\
    \ cases have been increasing 8.7% per year. To address the full spectrum of infectious\
    \ diseases, innovations must deliver simple and affordable testing capabilities\
    \ similar to routine hospital admission blood analyses. The proposed antifungal\

    \ infections could benefit patients by improving patient management and hospital\
    \ logistics. Sepsis is the most expensive healthcare challenge, with an estimated\
    \ financial impact of more than $62 billion per year. This bloodstream infection\
    \ screening assay could impact the entire continuum of care ? from initial hospital\
    \ interactions through patient care and discharge ? by identifying infections\
    \ early, optimizing treatment, and increasing survival. Direct customer survey-based\
    \ estimates and independent information sources project a U.S. commercial opportunity\
    \ of 226 million annual assays (36 million hospital admissions, 40 million intensive\
    \ care patients, 130 million emergency walk-ins, and 20 million presurgical evaluations).\n\
    \ \nThe proposed project could result in the development of a user-friendly and\
    \ affordable analytical tool for early detection of bloodstream infections that\
    \ differentiates bacterial and fungal pathogens associated with sepsis and determine\
    \ their antibiotic sensitivity in hours. Sepsis is a major public health and economic\
    \ concern that results in one human death every 2.8 seconds. If bloodstream infections\
    \ go undetected or untreated, patients can quickly escalate into sepsis or septic\
    \ shock with mortality chances increasing by 8% per hour without appropriate antibiotic\
    \ administration. Rapid and accurate detection of a bloodstream infections prior\
    \ to the onset of sepsis is critical to limit the extent of tissue and organ damage,\
    \ mortality, and associated hospital costs. The proposed innovation includes the\
    \ use of an FDA-approved reagent called Limulus Amebocyte Lysate for clinical\
    \ bloodstream infections and antifungal antibacterial susceptibility testing to\
    \ guide therapeutic interventions, and routine surveillance of high-risk patient\
    \ populations. The technical approach for this Phase II encompasses proficiency\
    \ studies that would validate high-throughput detection of pathogens, as well\
    \ as their antimicrobial sensitivity and resistance profiles in clinical blood\
    \ specimens. Additionally, assay miniaturization and automation would be performed\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II is to improve schedule-based maintenance programs to ensure that industrial and farming equipment can function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The downtime associated with such high productivity equipment can result in significant lost revenue, and research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. The proposed technology seeks to effectively reduce or eliminate this downtime, creating value for manufacturers. This project proposes a novel deep learning approach to predicting bearing failure in rotating industrial equipment and enable maintenance teams to confidently plan optimal maintenance activities around equipment that is in the process of degrading. This solution also aims to cost-effectively use a patented methodology to monitor industrial material handling systems with a combination of stationary and mobile battery-powered wireless sensors.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes a novel deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. Monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. The proposed approach may not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but also seeks to quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions may be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Additionally, many existing deep learning approaches also lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where poor predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model?s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This technology may allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.

    This proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial opportunity of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from creating a paradigmatic shift in the way we achieve seismic protection. The use of mechanical metamaterials fosters new opportunities to increase current levels of seismic protection of buildings and infrastructure, which could ultimately increase the resilience of communities and save lives. Mechanical metamaterials are materials specifically designed to have unprecedented properties. Evolving from a traditional system-based design to a material-based design has the potential of creating seismic solutions that are more customizable and easier to install than most of the current technologies. This technology could replace current seismic protection systems that are traditionally aimed at saving building occupants' lives, but may not address the important equipment therein.  An enhanced level of seismic protection constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities and services requiring continuity of operations after earthquakes. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of increasing the resiliency of communities in seismic prone areas and reduce seismic related direct and indirect losses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for increasing the seismic resilience of our critical infrastructure, and in particular Information Technology (IT) facilities. The projects will result in a revolutionary advance in the seismic protection of vibration sensitive electronic equipment through the use of novel mechanical metamaterials made with an innovative hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) process. The feasibility of combining multiple AM processes to manufacture the multi-component internal architecture of such metamaterials will be demonstrated. In particular, the effectiveness of AM processes in combining hard and soft materials in a highly-complex architecture will be addressed, with the aim of enhancing the design space of the mechanical metamaterial. The effects of this enlarged designed space on the seismic resilience of IT facilities will be investigated by developing a specific seismic resilience framework. The framework will be used to analyze and compare the seismic resilience of data centers with traditional systems and highly customizable metamaterials, as resulting from the manufacturing process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase II project will be achieved through investigating approaches to leverage extended reality (XR) for immersive, interactive and intelligent training in manufacturing, healthcare and higher education, to accelerate learning, increase engagement, and foster more effective use of expensive equipment. In 2017, the global training market was estimated to be $388 B, while the US market was estimated to be $166 B. Training and design use cases frequently rank among the top 5 XR use cases in industry reports, and the enterprise VR training market alone is forecasted to grow at 140% year over year for the next five years to reach $6.3 B per year. XR technologies hold significant potential by providing users with a sense of presence and immersion heretofore not possible due to cost, safety, security, physical, geographical or other limitations. This project will pursue this growing market opportunity with content expected to bring together classrooms, labs, factories, hospitals and field service environments, broadly advancing learning and engagement in both schools and workplaces.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project lies in the development of high- fidelity modular and reusable virtual object and assembly models, customized models for scenarios, tasks, instructions and user proficiency, application of natural language processing techniques to enable conversational interactions in immersive multiplayer environments and the use of computer vision techniques to support effective reuse of content across both virtual and augmented reality settings. Specialized modules will be developed for each of the above functionalities and then integrated to develop an innovative, easy-to-use product that will make it easy for non-programmers to author and publish XR content for training, design, service and other use cases, as well as collect data to evaluate the content and experiences. Pilot testing will be conducted with users in the higher education industry to rigorously evaluate and iteratively refine the technologies and the final product. By judiciously combining XR, virtual objects, and simulations with voice, vision and collaboration, this project aims to build an innovative product that may enable anyone to build engaging knowledge-rich content.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel medical device for intramuscular injections that will reduce needlestick injury. Unintended or accidental puncture is the second most common occupational hazard for healthcare staff. An estimated 385,000 needlestick injuries occur in the United States each year impacting 5.6 million healthcare workers. Needlestick injury represents one of the largest risks, both financially ($258 million annually) and medically (e.g., bloodborne pathogen exposure), to healthcare providers. This project aims to develop a novel, flexible hypodermic needle with a safety syringe that enables rapid injections while replacing sharp needles and significantly reducing risks of unintended health care provider injury.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a novel, flexible, polymer needle-based safety syringe for health care providers to perform intramuscular injections in patients. A novel and variable stiffness shaft is integrated with an external safety lumen mechanism to create an integrated delivery system with the same delivery reliability and repeatability as standard needlesticks. The design will be prototyped and evaluated under a variety of human factors considerations. The device will be required to pass several mechanical tests for puncture, insertion, and lumen integrity in a consistent manner, as anticipated during routine clinical use.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project includes reductions in food waste, energy use, and carbon emissions by developing a highly efficient and adaptable system for refrigerated transport. Mini-containers, which are small, insulated boxes with environments controlled by a central driving unit that contains a refrigerator and other environmental controls are proposed. The technology may increase the economic feasibility of small farms by allowing them to target a more resilient, efficient, and potentially carbon-neutral cold supply chain. The potential impact of the research includes improved availability of nutritious food for the general population and mitigation of negative environmental effects of cold logistics. Additionally, mitigating food waste will create savings up and down the supply chain.

    Two key technical challenges are addressed in this research. The first area has, as its main objective, the development of a volume-adaptable refrigeration system that allows for the efficient operation of several levels of control to best adapt to high levels of cooling capacity needs. The second area of research corresponds to the development of the methodology and solutions algorithms to exercise a hybrid control strategy for the optimal scheduling operation of the refrigeration system. The archetype refrigeration system would be subject to constraints imposed by the heterogeneous loads stored in the different special storage and transportation units known as mini-containers which receive cooling and other environmental services.  This technology will allow for efficiently aggregating, storing, disaggregating, and distributing fresh products in the mini-containers. The mini-containers will allow the emergence of efficient cold logistics for small loads by enabling the capacity of large transportation containers to be split among multiple conveyances. The proposed solution will also make it possible to convert almost any truck into a refrigerated truck and any warehouse into a cold storage facility, supporting the emergence of sharing economies in cold logistics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of the first minimally invasive cryoablation solution to treat high-risk patients with gallbladder disease. The current gold standard for treating gallbladder disease is surgical removal of the gallbladder. While this procedure works well for healthy patients, the use of general anesthesia has been shown to increase complications in elderly patients with underlying chronic medical conditions, leading to a $675 million cost to the US healthcare system each year. Furthermore, patients too sick for surgery have no definitive treatment options, underscoring the need for a safer alternative. Phase I efforts demonstrated the ability to safely deliver cryoablation energy via a minimally invasive catheter system to chronically defunctionalize porcine gallbladders without removal. Phase II efforts will focus on product development of the cryoablation system and optimization of clinical delivery parameters. The goal of the technology is to allow clinicians to provide their patients with the benefits of surgery, without the risk.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a minimally invasive cryoablation system capable of safely and effectively targeting the gallbladder. Initial testing of the cryoablation system has demonstrated the ability to uniformly generate lethal cryoablation temperatures (<-20?) across the gallbladder lumen, leading to durable gallbladder scarring and defunctionalization in porcine animals up to 60 days post-procedure. Key technical objectives of this project are to develop the industrial design of the introducer, cryoablation catheter, and control system for improved clinical usability and manufacturability, to further test and characterize clinical delivery parameters to inform treatment planning, to improve sensor reliability and control system response time to optimize safety profile, and to validate the integrated system in vivo to demonstrate system performance with optimized dosing parameters. The system will be evaluated in an advanced benchtop model gallbladder under a thermal load, ex vivo gallbladder tissues, and an in vivo chronic animal model to optimize and validate the cryoablation catheter and integrated control system. The anticipated result of this project is a clinically viable gallbladder cryoablation system with established clinical delivery parameters and dosing guidelines.

The compound semiconductor market, valued at $36+ billion in 2022, has increased recently with growing consumer demand for EVs.  The annual growth rate of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors, the most prominent devices, is estimated at over 20%. Despite the wide-scale production of these components in an industry that expects near perfection in manufacturing, the current yield of power electronic components is less than 50%. Poor yield results largely from an inability to adequately inspect substrates and epitaxial wafers used for power electronics. Instead, the industry currently relies on inspection tools with poor defect selectivity or destructive methods that can only provide statistical information about the defects in a wafer batch. To increase wafer yield, the team will develop a new type of optical inspection tool for selectively measuring defects in every wafer. If successful, this novel inspection technology will enable the industry to help drive down costs and increase performance of energy-efficient power electronics.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the novel way in which technology developed for use in fundamental science is being applied to rapid semiconductor inspection. The proposed method, called ultrafast imaging, uses the nonlinear optical response of a semiconductor induced by an ultrafast laser to isolate defects that measurably impact the electronic structure of the semiconductor. Though the semiconductor industry has typically focused on measuring morphology to find defects, measurement of compound semiconductors requires a tool that is sensitive to the electronic structure. This project will validate ultrafast imaging through benchmark testing against industry standards and develop an easy-to-use device for getting this technology into the hands of manufacturers. Partner manufacturing and inspection companies will provide inspection data and corresponding wafers, allowing correlation of ultrafast imaging defect measurements with data provided by other industry tools. Additionally, the team will develop and demonstrate an easy-to-use commercial product for user facilities and industrial research and development facilities, another essential step in the development of a high-throughput inspection tool. This benchtop product will not only improve current semiconductor technologies but will also be useful for scientists to characterize the next generation of semiconductors.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the diagnosis, risk assessment,\
    \ and monitoring of cancer. Nearly 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer\
    \ in their lifetime. Diagnosis of cancer in later stages dramatically reduces\
    \ treatment options, leading to poor prognosis and low survival rates. In addition,\
    \ the average cost of treatment for late-stage patients can be 3?5 times higher\
    \ than that for early-stage patients due to the potential need for multiple rounds\

    \ lead to improved patient outcomes but will likely reduce the overall costs of\
    \ cancer treatment. Moreover, a minimally invasive and highly accurate diagnostic\
    \ could be broadly administered to effectively identify those with various cancers,\
    \ enhancing the commercial potential further. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation\
    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an advanced microfluidic system\
    \ for the isolation and assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC clusters\
    \ (CTCCs) for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Microfluidic devices in various\
    \ forms have been developed to isolate the extremely rare CTC population from\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Today, cUTIs account for 400,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Unfortunately, multidrug resistant pathogens are a common cause of cUTI. Many are resistant to the first-line antibiotic (Ceftriaxone), which is used as the empiric treatment of this condition. However, the high incidence of multidrug resistant pathogens causing cUTI delays the time until patients receive more appropriate treatment. Delayed time to appropriate therapy in cUTI has been attributed to extended hospital stays and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The current standard test for diagnosing a drug-resistant cUTI takes 2-3 days from obtaining a patient sample. Therefore, diagnostic tests that can rapidly inform the initial treatment of UTIs are urgently needed to improve patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a rapid urinary diagnostic test that will enable the detection of ceftriaxone-resistant uropathogens. Early detection of resistance to first-line therapies would enable antibiotic prescribing to be informed, reducing the risk of disease progression in patients. In the case of UTIs, disease progression can lead to severely invasive infections, predominately sepsis. Therefore, diagnostics that can detect resistance to first-line antibiotics enable early treatment interventions, reducing the time to appropriate treatment and reducing the risk of disease progression. Decreased treatment time also lowers the healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant cUTI, as disease progression is associated with increased lengths of hospital stays compared to susceptible infections. The completion of the Phase II project will yield the development of a prototype test that can provide actionable information regarding ceftriaxone susceptibility in less than 5 minutes. This project?s success will provide clinicians with a diagnostic solution for cUTIs that can be acted on immediately to improve patient outcomes and aid antibiotic stewardship by preventing the unnecessary use of inappropriate antibiotics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is found in its ability to provide a novel tool for clinicians for perioperative, post-surgical, and chronic pain management. This technology supports enhanced patient safety, international standards for enhanced recovery after surgery, reduced addiction potential and opioid sparing, reduced loading on clinicians and healthcare resources, reduced cost of healthcare services, and advanced capability of clinicians through training. The commercial impact exists in all facets of healthcare, including perioperative procedures, in-hospital step-down and recovery, ambulatory surgery center procedures, and chronic pain management. The potential exists to expand into other clinical markets including the military and first responders. This technology can support the national defense of the country by providing advanced care capability for wounded troops on the front lines, in recovery, and through rehabilitation. The solution also applies to use during times of national, state, and local crisis, and, as the hospital-at-home trend increases, that market can be pursued. Ultimately, the commercial impact exists in both worldwide use and in contributing to the overall projected increase in use of regional blocks in the coming decade.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project applies technology to a medical application that has not been addressed for over 130 years.  Based on clinical needs, a minimally viable device (MVP) has been developed and prototyped that objectively quantifies neural blockades. This project advances the capability of the MVP and advances information about the real-time in vivo status of a neural blockade. The goal is to assure device robustness under challenging clinical conditions, for different neural blockade types, and for physiologically diverse patient populations. The plan to reach these goals is to apply human factors and design engineering standards to the MVP to assure that: a) the user displays are readily understood, provide the expected information in an appropriate form and format, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; b) the user controls perform the required functions, are complete, reflect the appropriate nomenclature for the clinical environment, and support the required clinical processes and procedures; and c) the monitor is reliable, well fabricated, safe for the patient and user, and completely supports the acquisition, processing, display, and recording of pertinent data. The resulting technology will be a robust patient monitoring device that assures patient safety and optimized treatment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of the first all-in-one automated syphilis test available at the point-of-care. The number of syphilis cases in the United States have doubled in the past 5 years with a five-fold increase in congenital syphilis passed from a pregnant mother to the fetus. Annual infections now account for $170 million in lifetime medical costs. This low-cost, portable test will enable care providers and outreach efforts to immediately diagnose and treat patients in a single visit to halt the spread of syphilis infections in the most vulnerable populations. Syphilis testing in this platform will be readily combined with hybrid detection of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) to streamline syphilis testing with existing programs for HIV diagnosis and further encourage uptake of this test solution into clinical practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for easier syphilis testing solutions to provide comprehensive diagnosis on-site with the patient. Syphilis diagnosis relies on two separate antibody tests, of which one requires quantifying antibody levels with a tedious laboratory procedure called Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) to confirm if the patient has an active infection. The lack of resources and personnel to conduct RPR testing on-site severely limits the ability of public health clinics to effectively diagnosis syphilis in a timely manner. This project will combine both antibody tests including quantitative RPR into an automated cartridge for rapid and complete syphilis diagnosis at the point-of-care. The research proposed in this project will develop magnetic particle-enabled assays for each antibody test and integrate the assays into a multiplexed plastic cartridge. These cartridges, combined with a portable instrument, will enable all steps required for syphilis diagnosis to be completed within minutes in an affordable and easy-to-use format.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to empower the processors of harvested fruits and vegetables with the flexibility to use robotic automation to meet their labor needs. The automation uses collaborative robots (cobots) guided by computer vision, which are potentially safe around humans. The technology will help assure consistent produce quality and processing rates. Through a robust cobot-based solution, the project will provide an affordable, sustainable, and safe means for farms of all sizes to keep up with their production goals, which will sustain competition and the nation?s food supply. This project has the added benefit of upskilling workers in farms by creating openings for more technically oriented positions, both in monitoring and maintaining the cobots. Instead of tediously programming the cobot for each use, the project is introducing a new way of translating the tasks performed by humans to the cobot by learning from camera recordings. It will also improve understanding of how cobots can safely be used alongside humans in a shared working space.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project aims to make it possible to use cobots with human workers on tasks that go beyond the traditional pick-and-place. The proposed technology will automate processing line tasks that require computer vision, which is challenging because accurate and reliable perception must guide the robot?s motion. Research has coalesced the technical challenges on the path to a viable commercial product around five steps. These start with a formal description of the task domain followed by using robust implementations of noise-tolerant machine learning algorithms for automatically learning the task, and end with a solution that integrates the learned task behavior with a vision-guided cobot system. Phase 1 will support research toward addressing two problems. The first is to design an intuitive way to elicit a precise specification of the client?s task domain. A digital conversational assistant will utilize multiple modalities for the elicitation. The second is the inability of available implementations to generate coworker-aware and efficient cobot movements. The research will investigate and develop significant improvements to the cobot motion to improve coworker safety while reducing the processing time by an expected 50%.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel mixed-mode (wind, wave, current) ocean energy converter that aims to be an improvement over the state-of-the-art offshore wind turbine design. This project will clarify design specifications to target a low-cost product with production scalability. Markets with the largest opportunity to benefit from this solution include US grid power, remote US islands (Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, US Virgin Islands), other remote islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, and dispatchable power sources for emergency power generation like the Department of Defense. The environmental benefit of advancing the design of renewable energy converters and reducing the initial investments required by offshore clean energy may positively impact both the scope and the timeline for adoption of ocean renewables in the US.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an efficient energy converter that drastically lowers the cost per installed unit through reduced weight of product components, onshore assembly, simplified installation, a lower center of gravity, and by achieving a storm rating. When coupled with offshore energy storage, this technology has the potential to unlock energy capture in ocean sites further offshore than is presently feasible. This project builds upon initial concept modeling and a 1/20 scale prototype construction, which validates the weight/power ratio, device stability, and comprehensive analytical evidence for commercial feasibility. Keeping the final cost-to-kilowatt low, while optimizing the overall design will be the major technical focus of the work plan, along with mitigating strategies for the risk of severe weather survivability. The proposed research will approach the design of each component individually with a focus on reducing cost and weight, while optimizing strength and output. Through the construction and testing of a proposed prototype, the team will conduct detailed analyses on scalability, performance, and cost factors that are critical for commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow recycled plastics to be used more efficiently and affordably than is currently possible. Regulatory and societal pressures are forcing reconsideration of single use plastics, and manufacturers of plastic film must use recycled plastic at higher quantities. However, it is difficult for the manufacturers to affordably reincorporate single-use plastics due to the low quality and unpredictable content of the material. Increasing yield of usable plastics through use of the proposed technology is expected to reduce waste, offering the potential to annually save 6.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the US and Canada, and 28 million metric tons globally. Also, the greater use of artificial intelligence in manufacturing is of strategic advantage to the US, with the proposed technology also applicable to metals, paper, or advanced materials. Furthermore, skills shortages are impacting manufacturing and are likely to worsen due to a rapidly aging workforce. A great deal of on-the-job expertise will be lost in the coming years as a generation of experienced operators retires. The proposed solution can ease this transition, acting as an expert decision system to carry the intelligence forward and help maintain US manufacturing competitiveness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will apply artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and process control methods to plastic film extrusion, and subsequently to other types of manufacturing. Currently hardware solutions exist for manufacturers, though they can be expensive, difficult to use and maintain, and can require specialized skills to use. By contrast, the proposed technology is a software-based approach to the control of complex plastic film extrusion processes, particularly in the context of widely variable input materials such as recycled plastics. The AI software will be robust to changes in the production environment and will account for process drift over time. These technology capabilities are industrially novel and not known in the academic literature. Phase I outcomes suggest that the technology can automatically control extrusion processes to achieve optimal steady state production faster than is the currently possible via human control. The AI-based expert system effectively recreates the knowledge tacitly held by long-experienced factory operators. This type of industrial automation has the potential to be value-generating for the wider manufacturing sector. The proposed technology may be applicable to a wider range of extrusion manufacturing processes, such as extrusion of metals, paper or advanced materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a commercial building management system that uses model predictive control for small to mid-sized commercial building owners to help them flexibly manage increasingly complex energy codes and prices. This technology uses machine learning to automate costly aspects of advanced building control, and eliminating complexity, frustration, and expense for leanly staffed building owners who are attempting to save money, meet code, reduce carbon footprint and adapt to rapidly changing energy prices. The proposed approach significantly reduces the setup time, the amount of training data, and the compute time needed for the technology to converge on accurate models and predictions using building thermal dynamics. These improvements reduce the controller costs without sacrificing accuracy. This technology will simplify the setup and implementation process for under-represented segments in the building automation, efficiency and model-based controls market starting with K-12 schools. This simplification has several distinct societal and environmental benefits including: increased energy and demand charge savings, increased energy efficiency, improved environmental footprint, increased job creation for building controls technicians, improved resiliency, and additional educational opportunities for K-12 families and communities.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology capable of building efficiency control.  The innovation employs a hybrid approach based on constrained deep learning tools that build on physical knowledge of building systems and architecture, thereby making use of sampling data while producing physics-consistent accuracy in modeling and control predictions. Specifically, the project team hopes to converge on an architecture that can more reliably and accurately manage energy use and occupant comfort compared to state of the art control approaches. The project team also aims to demonstrate a significant reduction in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)-driven peak system demand in target buildings while keeping instrumentation, labor, and data costs per building to an affordable cost for the target market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of technology that unlocks the use of abundantly available geothermal hot dry rock energy for reliable renewable energy. This technology will be economically feasible and provide an optional zero emission cogeneration configuration for harnessing cooling loop waste heat from zero emissions thermal electric power plants. The additional benefits, broader impacts, and market opportunity for cogeneration applications create an increase in power generation efficiency and capacity.  Increases in net zero emissions power will also be available at utility scale. This technology will reduce water use during wet cooling in power plants by replacing the iconic supplemental cooling towers for thermal electric power plants worldwide with cogeneration. Some larger and long-term societal impacts of this research include: a more stable power grid due to reliable geothermal renewable energy generation and a cleaner environment especially for populations living close to traditional power plants and industrial infrastructure. Global technology licensing applications include: grid flexing and resiliency, water desalination/filtration, green hydrogen production, and national security.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop software that uses computation, measurement, observations, and computer models, based on sound theory to find operational boundaries, validate key performance metrics, and optimize functional parameters for more efficient power production. This research includes the examination of critical technology functions and elements that determine peak operational efficiencies. The goal of this research will be to produce analytical computer models to look specifically at: 1) air intake velocity for a given set of pressure differentials, 2) air intake impedance, 3) thermal/pressure gradients generated by heat exchange activity, 4) air flow impedance generated by heat exchangers, and 5) expected exhaust air flow given idealized intake, heat exchange configurations, and designs. Anticipated results will provide quantifiable and measurable data tables including system sizing, energy input requirements, and mechanical and organic inlet air flow with emphasis on modeling of data analysis and determining specific energy inputs and power outputs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on improved methods for detecting and suppressing sea lampreys in the Great Lakes, a pest species that currently requires relentless, sustained, and costly control efforts at ecosystem scale. The project initiates the development of small, relocatable, field-deployed devices, capable of performing a range of assessment and selective control functions. Success in this effort will introduce an important new tool to bolster environmental health outcomes at an ecosystem level, and benefit commercial fisheries estimated at $7B annually. By replacing chemical and manual control of exotic invaders, the project contributes to the preservation of ecosystem integrity and function, biodiversity, and environmental quality of the Great Lakes, a vital natural resource providing water security for more than 35 million people in the region. With worldwide damage from aquatic invaders exceeding $300 billion annually, innovations driving advances in ecosystem protection and restoration will have wide appeal and application wherever habitats require protection. Broadening the available tool set empowers managers and local communities to act against exotic invaders at the level where causes and consequences are most acutely felt.


    This project performs a feasibility study of existing technologies from aquaculture workflows for adaptation to the uncrewed control of sea lampreys in the field. The essential features of such a device are inherently similar to recently emerged solutions for automated fish management in robotic aquaculture systems. Existing models for detection and classification are expected to transfer well to a class as morphologically distinct as lampreys. The primary challenges to this project most likely arise from the unique biology and sensory ecology of a species whose responses to the physical device used here are completely unknown. A set of artificial stream experiments aims to entrain lampreys into devices placed into their path. How might lamprey react to a device optimized for the specific needs of imaging, classification, and selective removal? Informed by detailed knowledge of lamprey chemosensory ecology, the work also examines the efficacy of pheromonal cues for channeling lamprey movement through the device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the growing need for accurate models and forecasts of the Arctic.  As Arctic maritime operations such as fishing, shipping, and mariculture of kelp are increasingly impacted by unprecedented climate change, traditional modeling techniques are unable to support these new demands. Ecosystems are not static, and their unpredictability hinders safe and sustainable economic development for communities. This modeling approach supports the economic competitiveness for Alaskan fisheries by increasing transparency of resources on short timescales (precision fishing) and long timescales (ecosystem modeling). The results could be used to identify new and emerging locations for fisheries, under- or over-fished locations, and differences between locations that can be restored or those that the ecosystem has shifted away from supporting. By applying dynamic ecology information, this project can provide tools to improve management of ocean resources, which could increase industry profits while simultaneously raising the total harvestable biomass.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II innovation is to create and refine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine capable of generating custom environmental models, making new and emerging science quickly accessible to the people and communities that need the solutions. The AI-produced software will integrate multiple types of scientific techniques from the fields of nearshore bathymetry models, habitat mapping, precision fishing, and Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) tools. Scaling the generation of tailored models provides cost effective, adaptable, and accurate solutions to ocean environmental challenges. Successfully executing this plan will require a combination of technical and computing skills; numerical modeling expertise; significant scientific literacy in remote sensing, bathymetry, sea ice, physical oceanography, and fisheries science; and the development and training of novel neural network architectures.  In Phase I work, remote sensing from satellites was used to map the nearshore in the prototype AI engine. Remote sensing from new satellite resources has enabled this effort of a deeper understanding of the world?s remote locations, like the Arctic Ocean. These data deserts can leverage satellites and pockets of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge to build productive, new economies that are resilient and adaptable.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable communities impacted by air pollution and extreme heat to design and implement solutions to these problems in a fast and cost-effective way. Air pollution increases the risk of cancer, stroke, heart-disease, and respiratory infections, and may play a role in Alzheimer?s and diabetes, resulting in human suffering and trillions of dollars of health care costs globally each year. Extreme heat is a growing source of additional health-care concerns and costs. These costs are shouldered by insurance companies, governments, businesses, and citizens. Air pollution can be reduced by carefully placed trees.  These trees also reduce extreme heat by shading and evaporation of water. There is potential for improving human health via targeted engineering of tree placements. This project will develop analysis and design tools to help with such tree plantings to generate the maximum possible health and financial benefits, at the lowest cost and with the shortest timelines. Local businesses can use this tool to make sure that they get paid fairly for reducing health care cost burdens of health insurance companies, governments, and pollution producers, while making communities and the environment more resilient.

    While existing literature indicates that trees may provide an effective air pollution and heat-island mitigation strategy. Stakeholders seeking to implement such strategies need tools to ensure that the plantings are as effective as possible. Existing planning tools are not of sufficient resolution or site specific, and often do not employ evidence-based design strategies. This project will perform high resolution vegetation analysis on a wide variety of neighborhoods. This data will be used to train a set of algorithms to infer high resolution vegetation properties from widely available, low-cost data streams. These inferred vegetation metrics will be integrated with a geospatial ecosystem design automation pipeline to create a software tool. The software tool will provide environmental justice communities, ecosystem designers, health insurance companies, governments, and local businesses with the ability to implement cost-effective ecosystem interventions with quantifiable air quality and heat island benefits. These benefits can be used to calculate financial health benefits. Because the benefits quantification will be based on ongoing validation and monitoring projects, the tool can be used to leverage private financing for improving public health and improving the environment.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving landfill diversion and recycling\
    \ rates of non-industrial waste. This project targets high-traffic venues (HTVs)\
    \ with controlled waste streams such as stadiums, universities, airports, and\
    \ theme parks. Waste stream sorting to differentiate classes of materials for\
    \ recycling and landfill is currently undertaken either using rudimentary, labor-intensive\
    \ manual sorting, or expensive and technically complex robotic sorting, neither\
    \ of which are feasible options for small- to mid-sized facilities (i.e., HTVs),\
    \ which then shoulder heightened rates imposed by material recovery facilities\
    \ due to contamination. These expenses have discouraged recycling, contributing\
    \ to the mounting waste problem. This project seeks to develop an intelligent\
    \ waste-sorting system that leverages computer vision and innovative hardware\
    \ to enable on-site, decentralized sorting, facilitating the recapture of the\
    \ 66 million tons and $200 billion worth of recyclable materials that currently\
    \ go to waste each year. By mitigating waste accumulation in landfills and the\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions associated with virgin resource mining, this technology\
    \ supports United Nations sustainable development goals 11 (sustainable cities\
    \ and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) and aligns\
    \ with the NSF?s mission of advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare.\
    \ \n\n\nThe proposed technology consists of a hardware-software solution that\
    \ uses the latest in computer vision to perform automated singulation (i.e., arranging\
    \ objects in a 1-by-1 stream) and classification in cluttered environments, allowing\
    \ for increasingly complex (or diverse) structures (shapes, sizes, and materials)\
    \ to be accurately identified and subsequently sorted. This approach produces\
    \ an ordered stream of objects, which can then be sorted according to any diversion\
    \ scheme for efficient recycling. The software uses semi-supervised learning to\
    \ allow for domain adaptation from a centralized training set, enabling rapid\
    \ implementation of optimized sorting schemes of site-specific waste streams,\
    \ requiring significantly less human intervention than traditionally needed. Successful\
    \ development would result in a simplified sorting platform that is cheaper, more\
    \ robust, and less resource intensive than existing waste sorting operations,\
    \ thus offering a novel turnkey solution that could be feasibly adopted on-site.\
    \  Research objectives include: 1) Developing and evaluating hardware assemblies\
    \ using electromechanical processes for waste stream singulation; 2) Developing\
    \ software for efficient dataset generation and waste stream classification, particularly\
    \ using semi-supervised learning and data augmentation approaches; and 3) Validating\
    \ the developed system for high precision singulation and classification of recyclables\
    \ under noisy like conditions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission\
    \ and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new generation of smart machines used in the measurement of parts and assemblies. The team has demonstrated that this technology can convert existing coordinate measuring machines to self-driving autonomous machines. The ability to automatically measure parts is an important feedback link in the process chain that will enable fully automated manufacturing of the future. Specifically, this automation will reduce the specialized skill required to use a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The innovation will enable workers to operate a CMM and get a precise part measurement. This device is especially helpful as the skilled manufacturing/metrology workforce is retiring as it gives new employees the ability to provide accurate information with little/no training. This innovation also gives the manufacturing companies an option to buy a new machine or upgrade their existing coordinate measuring machine. While the focus of this proposal is part identification, this technology has ready applications in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, robotics, and automated assembly lines. This capability will make the US manufacturing sector stronger and more technologically advanced.

    The objective of this proposal is to develop a new technology to identify machined parts and assemblies. This technology will be implemented on coordinate measuring machines (CMM), which are used widely in the manufacturing sector to measure the shape and size of parts. The proposed technology will enable autonomous measurements of parts allowing a higher level of automation. In this identification technology, the team will use live images from a camera, multiple solid model/Computer Aided Design (CAD)-generated images, and advanced image processing. Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to the image processing of part images will ensure correct part identification. Correct identification of parts as seen by the camera is the remaining unsolved challenge to achieving self-driven automatic measurements of parts. Most machined parts are textureless and most of the information is contained in the edges. Current image processing techniques work well with texture-rich parts but are unreliable with textureless machined parts. AI/ML enhanced image processing using edge and shape information is a promising approach, solving this problem will lead to the birth of a new generation of CMMs that can measure parts automatically.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a marketable and cost-effective U.S. manufactured foundation system to support offshore wind turbines (OWTs). The planned offshore wind energy production in the U.S. has been growing rapidly and the industry is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion within the next two decades. Although only 42 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy were installed in the U.S. during the last 10 years, planned projects have been growing rapidly targeting 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050, with strong support from coastal states. Achieving the targets of offshore wind energy requires cost-effective and innovative components of these energy systems. One of the main costs for offshore wind energy systems is their foundations, with costs typically ranging from 14% to 34% of the overall project cost. OWTs are commonly supported on large-diameter foundations, which the U.S. does not have the capability to fabricate and instead relies on foundations fabricated abroad. Therefore, a U.S.-manufactured foundation system to support renewable offshore wind energy infrastructure, enhance domestic supply chains, and reduce dependency on foreign manufactured foundations is proposed. The result of this research is a U.S.-manufactured alternative with savings of over half the cost per meter, enabling wider adoption of alternative energy harnessing technologies.


    The goal of the proposed project is to develop a U.S.-manufactured, bio-inspired, enhanced capacity foundation system to support offshore wind energy infrastructure that provides technical improvements and cost-saving to currently used systems. The proposed project also provides: (1) ease of adoption by providing similar weight and installation approaches to current means and methods; (2) better durability and longer service life than currently used OWT foundations; and (3) improved speed of construction promoting scalability. Furthermore, the proposed system will allow for optimized design, increasing the foundation capacity and improving the installation process.  Preliminary tests show that the proposed design could improve the foundation capacity by up to 100% compared to that of the currently used foundation systems when subjected to long-term cyclic loading similar to those experienced by OWTs.  The proposed concept could be used as a driven pile, suction caisson, anchors, or gravity base providing several options for the offshore wind energy industry in the U.S. To achieve the project goal, this research will focus on: (1) verification of key material properties for marine environmental conditions, (2) structural design of foundation cross-sections, (3) installation analyses on proposed foundations in marine environments; and (4) investigations of the effects of the bio-inspired design on foundation capacity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on development of a handheld optical scanner that integrates precise imaging with optical spectroscopy.  Although this technology has broad applications ranging from industrial quality control to education, the beachhead sector to be addressed is precision agriculture. To feed a growing population of 10 billion in 2050, agricultural production will need to increase by 70% over the next 30 years. Critical to this mission is the development of innovative tools and strategies for crop protection and health management to preserve the world?s food supply. The potential customers in this segment are crop growers, consultants, and field scouts aiming to act early while reducing the use of harmful and costly chemicals. The global crop monitoring market was estimated at $2 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $6 billion by 2027, growing at 15.3% annually. The sensing and imaging segment accounted for 49.3% of the market in 2019. This technology has the potential to support the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices as well as the economic viability of small- to medium-scale farm operations in the U.S. by providing an accessible and affordable tool for disease detection and crop health management.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the commercial development of novel and affordable imaging spectroscopy technology in addition to application-specific analytics for the early detection of crop afflictions. Optical components of the scanning device that will be designed-for-manufacturing in this project bridge the current gap created by systems that trade the detection capabilities of spectral resolution for spatial resolution. The scanner will be deployed to collect data on grapes, a key, high-value crop that is susceptible to a number of afflictions that destroy yields before the human eye can detect them. Machine learning algorithms will be developed from this data to detect stressed and diseased states in the plant before they become apparent to visual inspection. These models will then be validated in the field with user feedback from horticultural experts and customers. Successful implementation of this technology will facilitate the detection of crop diseases before they spread. This detection capability can increase yields while reducing the use of costly and environmentally-harmful pesticides and fertilizers.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and\

    \  Nutraceuticals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish,\
    \ and livestock, as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae\
    \ can be used as a feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from\
    \ the environment.   However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve\
    \ its full commercial potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical\
    \ algal cultivation relies on high-density cell growth, this project will focus\
    \ on the science of low-density algal cultivation to achieve high productivity,\
    \ while minimizing process requirements for supplemental energy and concentrated\
    \ CO2.  In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with\
    \ emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily\
    \ replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the\
    \ system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture and biofuels industry,\
    \ leading to greater economic development in marginal communities and a source\
    \ of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis SBIR Phase\

    \ production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges\
    \ in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and\
    \ increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research\
    \ activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications\
    \ for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order\
    \ to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus\
    \ design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;\
    \ 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the\
    \ need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder\
    \ to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a novel waterless rock fracturing technology that can replace hydraulic fracturing in the future.  Hydraulic fracturing requires pumping of millions of gallons of water into a reservoir to create permeable pathways within the rock, and increase hydrocarbon recovery rates. However, hydraulic fracturing technology has been banned in some regions within the United States, and in various countries across the globe due to water scarcity and environmental concerns. This has left trillions of dollars in petroleum resources trapped within the earth, negatively impacting the global economy. The waterless fracturing technology being developed under this project utilizes pulsed electrical energy to fracture rocks instead of water, allowing for hydrocarbons to be recovered with minimum environmental impact. The research conducted during this project will provide further insights into the advantages of utilizing electricity to fracture petroleum reservoirs and assist in accelerating successful commercialization of the technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel electric reservoir stimulation method to increase reservoir permeability without requiring pumping of hazardous material into the subsurface. This project will advance the development of an electric stimulation method by testing it on rock samples under higher pressure and temperature conditions, to mimic the downhole conditions of several common petroleum reservoirs and allow for optimization. This project will also include the design of a downhole tool that will be utilized to carry electrical current from the surface to the target reservoir for field demonstrations of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the most common problems with complex prosthetic hands: lack of robustness, lack of waterproofing, lack of sensory feedback, and high cost. This project will advance the development of waterproof multi-articulated hands with a touch feedback system, offering an affordable solution to restore confidence and independence to over 10 million amputees worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the work done in Phase I to develop an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. The work in this proposal will involve advanced mechanical design techniques necessary for waterproofing a multi-articulated prosthetic hand. Additionally, the project will advance the development of a variable grip strength, semi-automatic contact reflex system to improve the range of manipulation tasks possible with upper limb prosthetic devices. Technical tasks include: 1) development of contact reflexes through integration of position control, pressure sensing interface, and speed control for both fine, compliant manipulation of delicate objects and gross manipulation of objects requiring high grip force; 2) waterproofing to an IP67 rating, a significant technical challenge because of the many potential points of ingress and required level of manufacturing precision;  3) the mobile application user interface; and 4) standardization for manufacturing at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is addressing the growing societal need for indoor air purification, as indoor air quality (IAQ) directly affects human health, productivity, cognitive function, and quality-of-life. Awareness of the long-term consequences of poor IAQ has recently witnessed an increase due to research results, improvements in monitoring and sensing technology, public awareness campaigns by organizations such as the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, and Environmental Protection Agency, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding sustainable, economical, and effective solutions to the problem of poor IAQ will greatly benefit public health and wellbeing and will help curtail the spread of pathogens, minimizing the need for social distancing.  This project will develop a new system air purification, addressing viruses, harmful chemicals, odors, and ultrafine particulates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to scale up the production methodology and coating process of novel catalytic materials. The materials are 3D nanostructured porous powders that are designed at multiple length scales to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and longevity, while reducing costs and utilizing raw materials in an environmentally responsible manner. The system uses a synthetic approach based on self-organization of nanoscale building blocks and wet chemistry tools in order to assemble finely structured coatings for integration in air-purification units. This project focuses on expanding it to production scale, wherein achieving control over the composition, structure, porosity, and placement of nanoparticles on a production scale is challenging.  The materials platform development will include adaptation to high-throughput instrumentation and scale-up of the material production and coating process to pilot production. In the process, this project will develop tools and guidelines for manufacturing hierarchically-structured functional materials more generally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop bio-based antioxidant products for industrial processes. Commercial development of peptide antioxidants has been limited for use in consumer, food, or therapeutic applications. This project will develop peptide antioxidants derived from the enzymatic digestion of agricultural biomass as alternatives to synthetic antioxidants used in the processing and storage of industrial fluids. Although synthetic antioxidants are critical for the stabilization of many industrial processes, they are derived from petroleum and tend to have toxicity and/or environmental safety concerns. The products resulting from this effort will be first-in-class innovations; safer and more environmentally responsible than existing products. Project activities will validate peptide performance in the initial target application area: the stabilization of vinyl monomer fluids and processes. This research will initially focus on vinyl monomer processing as well as four additional industrial markets where sustainable antioxidants could have a high impact. The estimated consumption of synthetic antioxidants in the five combined markets in 2022 will be close to 1 million tons.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a bio-based antioxidant product derived from sustainable materials and suitable for industrial process fluids. Antioxidant peptides derived from the enzymatic digestion of plant-based proteins have the potential to replace synthetic antioxidants in industrial processes. This project focuses on process compatibility, product stability, and antioxidative performance as key technical hurdles. This project will create a library of antioxidative peptides generated by the enzymatic digestion of plant proteins. This library will then be tested for the solubility of peptides with representative fluids under process conditions, potential formulation design, and for thermal and storage stability of the designed formulations. This project will lower technical barriers to advancing the commercial development of peptide antioxidants for applications across many industries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address major deficits in mathematical achievement among children living in the United States, and to develop new modes and approaches to learning with mobile technology. A growing body of research shows that the human brain is most receptive to learning math concepts in the pre-school years and that children who do not receive appropriate instruction at this early age often fail to achieve in mathematics later in life. This is of particular concern because mathematical ability is highly correlated academic success and future jobs increasingly require strong math and problem-solving skills, resulting in significant implications for the competitiveness of tomorrow?s workforce. This Phase II project will develop a next generation education technology that guides families and children through a series of learning activities, performed mostly off-screen, but which are guided an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile learning application. This technology supports new approaches to learning and has applications in the commercial sector as products using natural language processing (NPL) continue to proliferate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of new learning technologies that can encourage parent child interaction and aim to increase parent engagement in learning experiences with their children (ages 3-8). A cloud-connected mobile applications will provide regular opportunities for parent and child to build early math and problem-solving skills in age-appropriate, meaningful contexts. Machine learning algorithms deliver activities that match developmental milestones, learning objectives, and family interest. Animated characters guide users through activities both on and off computer and prompt meaningful conversations by asking both parent and child open-ended questions. AI technology analyzes recorded feedback to obtain the degree of engagement by considering nuances such as voice tone, phrasing, and number of conversational turns.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential reduction of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from marine diesel engines. There are approximately 4 million diesel-powered craft in use globally, emitting approximately one billion tons of CO2 and 100 million tons of NOx annually. This project seeks to remove at least 80% of the NOx and 30% of the CO2 from marine diesel exhaust, contributing to a reduction in both greenhouse gas emissions and in air pollution that creates health hazards in coastal cities. There is no alternative, commercially-viable product that reduces CO2 and NOx emissions from marine diesel engines. The proposed concept seeks to overcome the disadvantages of competing technologies that are unworkable due to heat and space restraints in a confined boat engine room. The project may enable boat manufacturers to meet new international maritime regulations on engine emissions and may contribute new knowledge related to the engineering of monitoring and delivery systems for marine and land/vehicle emissions reduction systems. In addition to environmental benefits, the technology meets a global commercial demand and creates good paying jobs for an export-oriented US industry.

    The goal of this project is to develop a low thermal electro-emulsification solution to reduce emissions in marine diesel exhaust, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 80% to meet the new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 30%. The technology will be incorporated into a fuel processing system that can be integrated into existing diesel engines on marine boats. This system will precisely inject reaction-altering chemicals at the proper time in the combustion cycle to reach the desired reduction of CO2 and NOx. The system will also monitor the exhaust stream to ensure no harmful byproducts are discharged into the marine environment. This work will further develop the understanding of diesel emissions reduction and may be transferable to other vehicle and land-based applications.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project impacts mothers and babies during the breastfeeding period. Although breastfeeding benefits for the mother and the baby are recognized worldwide, many mothers are unable to attain their breastfeeding targets due to common discontinuance problems. The proposed solution may increase breastfeeding rates by supporting mothers who are breastfeeding or breast pumping, providing them with resources to sustain breastfeeding. Access to valuable information on the volume of breastmilk expressed could enable mothers to carefully monitor their milk production. At the same time, it may allow the prediction of clogged milk ducts, avoiding serious complications such as breast engorgement or lactational mastitis that can be avoided with early intervention. This intervention could prevent not only early discontinuance in breastfeeding but also promote increased health for mothers by reducing the risks of disease. The monitor may also impact babies? health since breastfeeding is recommended to achieve optimal growth and development. Further, the proposed monitor may provide the scientific community with data to enable research into different aspects of mothers? health, for example, determining the reasons for the formation of mastitis.

    This project may lead to a new paradigm in lactational health for the baby and the mother. There is an important need to meet breastfeeding objectives by reducing discontinuances and reducing common conditions such as lactational mastitis. The proposed solution aims to increase breastfeeding rates by providing mothers with a comfortable and effective method for measuring the milk volume expressed and for determining if milk ducts are clogged. Research objectives include: (1) sourcing and testing fabrics for the bra from multiple vendors; (2) designing and developing of the embedded system and the bra, so that will be able to accommodate a wide range of breast shapes and sizes; (3) designing and developing mobile applications and algorithms, which will include data analytics and prediction; and (4) optimizing the bra and mobile applications. The project could result in a smart, all-day wearable, comfortable garment designed for breastfeeding mothers that is paired with a mobile app to show analysis and results adapted to each mother.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of advancing methods for preparing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for sequencing. Prior to sequencing a biological sample, DNA must be liberated from cells and separated from proteins and other unwanted debris, and then mixed with specialty buffers and chemical agents. This skilled task is currently carried out by trained scientists using largely manual manipulations of the samples and expensive equipment. The alternative method proposed in this project will speed-up diagnoses from genomic sequencing by significantly reducing preparation time while also making preparation more reliable through automation. Notably, the proposed approach is expected to prepare DNA without reducing its length; consequently, the process should be ideally suited for preparing samples for emerging long-read sequencing technologies. These improvements have the potential to decrease the burden and costs associated with DNA sequencing, hence expanding the benefits of DNA sequencing technology to wider segments of society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies upon a process for trapping genomic material in a small flow cell through which an electric field and pressure-driven flow are simultaneously applied. The process is highly selective towards strands of DNA or (ribonucleic acid) RNA; proteins and other, unwanted debris that enters the flow cell passes through. Also, the process is relatively gentle, so the length of sample should not be shortened as a result. This project will advance the technology to the marketplace by: (1) Completing cartridge design details and fabrication, including evaluation of material options; (2) Building a custom research and development platform for interfacing with the cartridges; (3) Developing methods for DNA sample extraction and transfer; (4) Developing the library preparation protocols using mixing and heating while toggling the Electro-Hydrodynamic Trapping; and, (5) Integrating the entirety of the preparation process into a single cartridge and validating the process performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a label-free, biological sample preparation and cell isolation platform for recovery of rare cells from a variety of sample inputs. Specifically, by carrying out sample preparation, manipulation, and monitoring on a single chip platform for selective cell recovery, the sample handling steps will be greatly reduced, thereby ensuring the maintenance of cell viability, improving sample consistency, and sustaining native cell behaviors. This recovered sample is essential for the development of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine and cancer management. Personalized medicine also requires precision cell recoveries.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an electrically functional microfluidic sample manipulation platform for phenotype-selective recovery of cells, based on their biophysical attributes. Specifically, microfluidic designs will be integrated to swap cells from complex biological inputs into an optimized buffer to enable cell manipulation. Also, instrumentation will be developed for on-chip monitoring of the sample during various stages of the phenotype-selective cell recovery process. Further, a variety of sample inputs will be validated on the designed devices to ensure performance, consistency, and reliability for translation into commercial product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide private and public stakeholders with new technological tools to better monitor and predict pandemics. This project is expected to modernize the tools used today by private and public laboratories to collect and purify pathogens, particularly human coronaviruses from community wastewater, for testing and diagnostic purposes. The new technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and time, and enable the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient time to take preventive measures. The technological products of this project are expected to empower the growing number of companies and laboratories offering wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) services and help establish WBE as a routine, cost-effective and reliable tool for public health monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small volumes.  These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The project?s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater to over 90%, while reducing costs. The developed tools will be independently tested and evaluated by third-party laboratories to confirm their performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the need for an accessible method to identify early-stage epithelial cancers, with high accuracy, earlier and at lower cost than is currently available. In 2020, the total cost of cancer care was nearly $210 billion. Due to the nature of current cancer diagnostics, most cancers are diagnosed and treated during late-stages. This results in a large economic burden to patients, families, healthcare providers, and facilities. To advance the health and welfare of the public and reduce the nation?s healthcare burden, there is a need for cancer screening, diagnostic, and monitoring devices that are non-invasive, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and accurate. The proposed platform for the early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers 1) addresses the lack of effective non-invasive portable screening devices; 2) provides faster, more discriminatory assessments in near real-time; 3) yields the most precise and accurate results to identify cancers earlier, when interventions are more impactful, less expensive, less invasive, and more likely to improve patient outcomes.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the feasibility of developing the first portable, programmable, single cell cytology platform for early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers, suitable for use at the point-of-care. The proposed technology will uniquely combine microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI) to act as a sensor and provide predictive analysis, allowing for the accurate classification of potentially cancerous tissue. The platform will support near real-time, multiparameter, single-cell cytology measurements and will provide a method for automated analysis of a plurality of key metrics. Proof of concept has been established for the application area of oral cavity cancers, with the approach demonstrating superior performance metrics compared to other diagnostics (tissue reflectance, tissue auto fluorescence, salivary testing, and cytology testing). It is the only adjunct that can distinguish between mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The key objectives for this project are to develop methodologies to link different clinical specimen types to the microfluidics environment, and a biomarker discovery process to identify biomarkers for different applications that are amenable to the platform. The successful completion of this project will enable the platform to recognize and assess various levels of dysplasia across multiple epithelial cancer types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in demonstrating the commercial viability and clinical benefit of a point-of-care diagnostics device based on novel technologies for patients with urinary tract infections. There are 10 million primary care visits for urinary tract infections per year in the United States. More than 15% of these patients suffer antibiotic-resistant infections. Clinical studies have shown that accurate identification and early diagnosis of the antibiotic resistance of the infecting bacteria shorten the treatment period, eliminate antibiotic misuse, and reduce average patient costs. However, on-site diagnostic testing that returns molecular information about the bacterial identity and antibiotic resistance remains a significant challenge. Current laboratory-based tests are costly, have long turnaround times, and require skilled technicians and well-equipped laboratories. In most cases, this results in empirical antibiotic prescriptions before the information is returned from test results. Developing rapid, on-site, easy-to-implement, and frequently used antimicrobial resistance screening is essential to combat the ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic misuse. This device will be suitable for outpatient clinics, home healthcare, and inpatient facilities. It will enable a shift from empirical to evidence-based treatment of bacterial infections.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a point-of-care device for the on-site identification of E. coli and associated extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) antibiotic resistance genes in urinary tract infections from unprocessed urine samples. The device uses novel, patent-pending electrochemical nucleic acid sensing techniques and a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay to semi-quantitatively measure target bacterial genes. The device consists of a disposable microfluidic cartridge and a portable multifunctional reader. The self-contained microfluidic sensing cartridge supports sample preparation, isothermal amplification, and sequence-specific electrochemical detection. This novel combination of sensing technology and highly integrated sample handling microfluidics will enable the development of critically needed point-of-care diagnostic solutions. The project will demonstrate the specificity of bacterial detection, the ability to identify multiple genotypes, the ease of device operation, and the portability of this point-of-care device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the communication between Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) individuals and the hearing community through automated sign language recognition. In the United States alone there are over 48 million D/HH individuals, who in total possess $87 billion in purchasing power. It appears businesses are not adequately serving this community, as is evidenced by the plethora of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) lawsuits against numerous companies. The proposed technology will provide plug-and-play software for organizations to improve their interactions with D/HH individuals. Businesses and governments will be able to interact with their D/HH employees, customers, or constituents when interpreters are unavailable. This technology can be integrated into a variety of platforms, from retail point-of-sale equipment to chatbots and video/teleconferencing systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project aims to develop technology to perform unconstrained sign language recognition and natural sign language production. Specifically, current methods to train language translation models are ill-equipped to handle the sign language domain due to the lack of training data within this domain. Additionally, all currently established methods (apart from motion capture, which is unscalable) for producing American Sign Language (ASL) result in stilted, unnatural signing from an avatar. This project will develop solutions to these issues within the domain of ASL via semi-supervised expert-augmented models and data augmentation techniques. Technical hurdles include the lack of models to handle high-dimensional low-resource language domains, and lack of sufficiently large datasets. Technical milestones include creating semi-supervised datasets, engineering data augmentation techniques, generating a natural signing avatar, and performing extensive usability testing. This project aims to produce a method for automatically interpreting between a low-resource sign language and English to improve accessibility and increase equity for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the high cost of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. As the world transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, the market for fuel cells is expected to increase substantially. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have a number of advantages, such as high durability, long range, and fast refueling over battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, fuel cells are less susceptible to the supply chain issues that lithium-ion batteries are beginning to suffer from. However, FCEVs are currently at a significant disadvantage to BEVs in terms of cost. Reducing the cost of the fuel cell stack will help to make FCEVs cost competitive with BEVs and will accelerate their adoption into the marketplace.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells by reducing the cost of the bipolar plate component. Bipolar plates currently account for approximately 30% of the full fuel cell stack cost. Current bipolar plates are made from either metal foils or molded carbon composites. Metal plates can be produced by high-speed, low-cost forming techniques, but must be made from expensive, corrosion resistant materials. Carbon bipolar plates are made from inexpensive precursors but are manufactured by processes which scale poorly. This project aims to demonstrate that a bipolar plate can be produced from a novel, low-cost, carbon-based sheet utilizing forming techniques analogous to those used for producing metallic bipolar plates. The effort focuses on optimizing the carbon sheet for low hydrogen permeability, demonstrating that flow channels can be stamped into the sheets, and quantifying functionality and durability by testing in small scale fuel cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to ensure robust consumer protection for financial applications using distributed ledger technology (DLT). This project aims to improve upon existing global financial infrastructure by replacing it with a safe, open, accessible network powered by the proposed next-generation distributed ledger architecture. Accessing traditional financial networks is a major challenge, and often requires significant capital coupled with deep industry connections. As DLT stands today, there are still challenges for it to safely support financial applications. DLT vulnerabilities can cost users billions of dollars and is leading to the same monopolistic dynamics that are characteristic of traditional financial infrastructure. This project aims to advance the foundation of distributed ledger technology to address these issues, and deliver an accessible, safe, democratized financial infrastructure that can operate on a global scale and support the untold myriad of value-added use cases from companies that cannot sustain the high economic costs, or overcome the accessibility barriers, of traditional financial infrastructure.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to advance distributed ledger technology to safely support financial primitives. Transaction information in modern distributed ledgers is public during origination, allowing validators to exploit this information and at times their privileged position to attack every financial primitive. As an example, there are issues with validators taking arbitrage opportunities and sequencing their own transactions first. Financial best practices are to silo transactions into distinct lifecycle stages to ensure consumer safety. This solution brings these best practices to DLT through a cryptographic commitment scheme. Cryptographic commitment schemes allow users to commit to an action without disclosing sensitive details, however, the traditional process requires centralization to coordinate the timing for disclosure. The primary research goal and objective for this Phase I project is proving the viability of a decentralized commitment scheme with real world latency and no centralized timekeeping or coordination mechanism. The proposed architecture will allow users to initiate transactions without including sensitive transaction details at origination. Without sensitive transaction details, validators can no longer exploit this information for their own gain, allowing this architecture to provide the security and privacy necessary for improved safety for financial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel and emerging method for treating a subset of heart failure patients. Despite modern medical regimen and device therapies, heart failure affects 6 million Americans and remains a leading cause of death and hospitalization in the United States. The proposed system and approach aim to provide a novel procedure and treatment paradigm by leveraging an established clinical access procedure for performing Greater Splanchnic Ablation (GSN). The system would enable rapid and wider clinical adoption of the emerging therapy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel, minimally invasive, catheter-delivered, venous procedure for performing extravascular Greater Splanchnic Ablation (GSN). The proposed catheter system utilizes a clinically accepted venous approach in order to perform extravascular denervation, while minimizing collateral (off-target) damage to the other surrounding tissues. The objectives of this project include designing and prototyping new devices that will enable localized energy delivery and incorporate a detection system indicative of procedural success. Both benchtop testing and pre-clinical animal model studies will be used to access and ablate, verifying the function and performance of the device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to promote the viability and sustainability of small-to-medium indoor, urban, and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) farms. As the global population grows to 10 billion by 2050, the agriculture industry will need to produce 70% more food using only 5% more land. Indoor farming can make a significant contribution to meet this demand sustainably. Indoor farmers are also seasonally and geographically independent, which means they can help meet demands for locally produced fresh foods and are protected from extreme weather events. These farms primarily use soilless growing methods, such as hydroponics, that currently suffer from critical needs for efficient and affordable methods to monitor and manage nutrients and water in order to be financially viable and environmentally sustainable. The proposed project provides an innovative solution for nutrient management in hydroponic farming, thereby lowering the costs, increasing the yield potential, and supporting the viability of such farms. By supporting the expansion of the national hydroponics industry, this project will increase the local production of and expand access to fresh produce.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a nutrient management system to provide CEA farmers with real-time information about the nutrients in the growth solution of their crops.  The proposed solution will utilize ion-selective electrode (ISE) technology and a decision support system powered by machine learning (ML). This project will focus on the critically needed engineering and data analytics research and development to de-risk major technical challenges in the development of the nutrient management system, providing proof-of-feasibility. The key objectives of this project are to: 1) design a special chamber for the sensors to minimize the interference and increase accuracy, 2) validate the feasibility and accuracy of this new design in a greenhouse setting, 3) develop a predictive algorithm to automatically calibrate the sensors, and 4) measure and predict deficiencies in leafy greens production: collecting empirical evidence of nutrient deficiency to train ML models to identify, and ultimately, predict a deficiency prior to when it is observable.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a low footprint drinking water treatment plant (WTP) suited to facilitate much-needed upgrades to the nation?s water infrastructure. Today?s drinking water treatment systems are suffering from high volumes of generated waste (~100,000 tons sludge per typical plant per year) and high maintenance requirements and costs (4x/year week-long clarifier decommissioning for cleaning). The aging infrastructure of many of the nation?s water treatment plants has left millions of Americans with inadequate drinking water. This situation, paired with the aging and shrinking water operator workforce, translates into a growing threat of water supply interruptions and noncompliance. Owing to its small footprint and low energy and maintenance demands, the proposed technology would deliver an easily implementable solution that could be adopted by communities and water systems around the world, even in remote areas. Successfully developed, the WTP will offer a unique economic opportunity to meet critical global sustainable development goals and promote human health and welfare. This technology will lower the barriers to upgrading the nation?s water infrastructure, creating jobs through the introduction of long-delayed upgrades through plant implementation.

    Elements of the innovation under development for the proposed water treatment plant include a self-modulating feedback/feedforward controller driving automated coagulant dosing, which is paired with a high-efficiency hydraulic flocculator that leverages turbulent flow to promote floc formation while remaining free of failure-prone moving parts; a self-cleaning clarifier fitted with settling plates and a sludge blanket system for efficient contaminant removal; a stacked sand filter that decreases the hydraulic loading rate for a given flow and bed volume, resulting in improved stability of the deposited particles (i.e., reduced shear and particle breakthrough); and a continuous sludge dewatering and treatment system that decreases the volume of produced sludge while also providing a continuous waste stream for further processing. While early efforts have established a proof-of-concept demonstrating operations at 50% less energy demand than conventional systems, continued research and development to improve system performance and autonomy are needed. In line with this effort, the Phase I effort will focus on: 1) development of an automated control system for precise coagulant dosing; 2) design modification to minimize waste stream volume; and 3) design and construction of a pilot plant with 15 gallons per minute capacity, suitable to meet the water treatment needs of communities of ~300 people.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes a notable reduction in the area burned\

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing solutions to farmers who are facing the culmination of decades of herbicide resistant weed species evolving from applications of synthetic herbicides. Creation of herbicides which are effective, naturally produced, scalable, and deployed using the current agronomic practices could alter the foundations of crop production in the United States and around the world. In view of the projected 8% annual increase in global food and agriculture market, shrinking areas under cultivation that lead to the need for higher productivity per acre, and increasing demand for nutritional food items, the need for sustainable alternatives to current synthetic herbicides that do not promote herbicide resistant weeds is becoming clearer. Widespread adoption of the proposed technology is expected to benefit farmers and crop producers reducing societal strain, financial burden, and environmental stress from crop losses due to herbicide resistant weeds by eliminating these weeds through an environmentally safe method, without the use of excess fuel, time, equipment, and synthetic herbicides.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a novel natural herbicide product that, when applied to herbicide resistant weeds, will cause seed or plant cell's membranes to degrade and lose integrity. Thus, the novel product is intended to work both as pre-emergent weed prevention and post-emergent weed control herbicide. The product will be an environmentally safe blend of natural plant extracts and excipients. The herbicide formulations will be sprayable onto soil or onto plant leaves and stems. The cost and time needed to initially screen herbicide rates, outcomes, and best practices typically is many years. The greenhouse screening approach takes months and provides valuable information to ensure that field trials, which are more expensive and impacted by changes in weather, are efficient in cost and outcomes. This project will initially focus on greenhouse validation of weed control of the most resistant weeds known in different geographical locations in the U.S. Dose response data for 50%-to-90% inhibition control/efficacy of herbicide resistant weeds will provide the information to develop a herbicide use label, directions for best practices, and good stewardship by using only the amount of herbicide needed for control without overuse.

    \ (STTR) Phase I project is to facilitate the adoption of battery electric vehicles\
    \ in the US by securing the supply chain, reducing battery cathode cost, and enhancing\
    \ US-innovated battery manufacturing. This project will address the several challenges\

    \ cathode materials use scarce and expensive elements, such as cobalt and nickel.\
    \  Second, the US battery manufacturing capability needs to be improved in order\
    \ to meet the rapidly growing demand, cathode materials production is especially\

    \ costly liquid and gaseous waste management. The proposed technology will create\
    \ fundamentally new ways to produce next-generation cathodes for American electric\
    \ vehicles. This project can significantly impact the battery field since the\
    \ proposed new cathode technology is expected to result in a major cost reduction\
    \ per electric vehicle battery pack. Advances in novel cathode chemistries and\
    \ manufacturing processes offer new opportunities for the US to establish the\
    \ leadership in cathode innovation and manufacturing. \n\nThis project develops\
    \ a fundamentally disruptive technology to enable the use of low-cost, cobalt-\

    \ manufacturing technology will be uniquely combined with new materials development\
    \ to enable stable battery cycling with a 700 Wh/kg specific energy at the cathode\
    \ materials level. The technology is compatible with mainstream lithium-ion electrolytes\

    \ commercial scale. The research and development objectives include: (1) design,\
    \ manufacturing, and characterization of new cobalt- and nickel-free oxide cathode\
    \ chemistries with abundant and low-cost elements, (2) develop cathode electrodes\
    \ with controllable physical properties based on an all-dry electrode preparation\

    The broader/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will result from the production of a useful game, called College Bound, that will entice youth to use their gaming time to learn how to navigate the college preparation, college-admissions, and financial-aid processes.  This assistance could help in addressing the problem of an inadequate number of counselors in high schools that serve large minority populations. Studies have shown that underserved high school students see a counselor for less than 20 minutes a year.  Since is also known that young people between the ages of 8-18 spend 7.5 hours a day engaged with media- either playing video games or watching television a game platform may enable minority students, who make up less than 4% of undergraduate enrollees in the national four-year colleges, to prepare for college attendence. The College Bound game seeks to recoup some of this screen time for positive benefits such as improving preparedness of the minority students to access higher education, and meeting future workforce demands in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on assisting underrepresented students in learning about what it takes to get college admission, how to prepare for it, and what financial aid is available to afford the education using a gaming environment. The project will focus on measuring students' knowledge about the college application process as the player navigates through different levels of the game. Knowledge about the college application process includes a) information about admission criteria and deadlines, b) the college acceptance and enrollment processes, and c) the ability to pay for college through scholarships, loans, work programs, and/or personal savings. Throughout the pilot phase, the project will develop reliable and valid evaluation tools to measure student learning in the game setting at each level of the College Bound game. These evaluation tools might reflect not only student learning performance but also boost college enrollment outcomes. These measures may also enable the school and other stakeholders to understand students' gaps and help strengthen students? pathways into college.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to implement a high-efficiency, low-power magnetic bearing that will enable the successful development of high-speed flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) both for space and terrestrial applications. FESS are mechanical batteries that overcome some of the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, such as the loss of energy capacity over time and the need for stringent temperature control. In space, FESS could reduce the overall mass associated with the battery pack and extend the mission life of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. On earth, FESS can take over some of the applications that are required to deliver high power for a short amount of time, such as electric vehicle charging stations or hospital back-up power units. Ultimately, FESS will help alleviate the demand for lithium-ion batteries while providing reliable, long-lasting energy storage.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the proposed magnetic bearing into a carbon-fiber flywheel. The complexity of this task comes from having the three main parts of the flywheel (composite rim, metal core, and magnets) created using different manufacturing processes. The magnetic materials need to be protected as they will not withstand the high speeds of FESS. De-risking this manufacturing process is crucial in continuing the development of this technology and in scaling up. Another challenge is that the high speeds of FESS are expected to cause high gyroscopic torques during satellite maneuvers. Therefore, investigating ways to increase bearing stiffness (e.g., by changing magnet size and position, or modifying coil shape), while assessing the effect of gyroscopic torques through numerical models, will be paramount. Finally, the magnetic bearing has the distinctive feature of being able to tilt the flywheel (within its gap tolerances), without requiring an external gimbal actuator. This feature could possibly allow the technology to be used for dual purposes, and its implications will be investigated at a system level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the fast and efficient loading of parcels into shipping containers ranging from small delivery vans to maritime shipping containers. This project will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of an algorithmic approach and robotic development. The technology is a step towards creating a fully autonomous system with expanded robotics capability to further enhance the efficiency and speed of outbound shipping for customers. Over 3,000 parcels are shipped every second. However, in the U.S., one out of every four trucks is empty, two are less than 50% filled, and only one is filled over 50% capacity.  Initial projections indicate that the technology under development could decrease trucking costs by 20%, reduce loading costs by 70-80%, and decrease loading time by 30%, all while meeting the demands of peak shipping seasons. Overall, increasing the density of parcel shipping will reduce greenhouse gas emissions (400 tons/per truck/per year), reduce traffic congestion, and enable smaller businesses to compete with large organizations by reducing their logistics and shipping operating costs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on advancing a bin packing algorithm to minimize void space in outbound shipping containers. The 3-Dimentional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) is a classic Nonlinear Programming (NP)-hard problem that has been studied for decades. To solve the problem, an effective and easy-to-implement constrained, quantum accelerated, deep reinforcement learning model is being developed. Monte Carlo Tree Search is an unsupervised, heuristic search algorithm technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable occurring at the end of a sequence of states. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) extends this technique by allowing the learned state-values to guide actions which subsequently change the environment state. A proof-of-concept assessment showed that the learned strategy meaningfully outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Outcome success metrics for this project are >90% utilization rate, sub 24 hours of model training time, and >2500 parcels/hour for any given data set. This foundation will be expanded by integrating many unique box sizes, exploring model performance in the face of broader circumstances (e.g., lookahead and stacking parameters, General Processing Unit (GPU) vs quantum training), and developing of a robotic gripper to enact algorithmic output.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the uptime of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and similar robotic systems to nearly one hundred percent at factories and fulfillment centers to further improve productivity and reduce overhead costs. These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in the marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a significant improvement in the accuracy of weather forecasts by increasing the refresh rate of sea wind measurements ten-fold. This forecast improvement will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States by improving efficiency in maritime, agriculture, and logistics industries. Improved weather forecasts will advance the health and welfare of the American public by enabling earlier storm warnings that save thousands of lives.  Improved weather forecasts will support national defense, while also saving hundreds of millions of dollars in false-alarm hurricane evacuations. Sea wind data will also directly benefit maritime operators, including recreational sailors, ocean carriers and fishers. Wind map and forecast subscriptions from maritime customers represent a $3 billion commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to study the feasibility of increasing the refresh rate of sea wind measurements ten-fold using a constellation of nanosatellite radars (scatterometers). Current satellites for measuring sea winds are prohibitively expensive and performance has not substantially improved since they were introduced decades ago. The objective of this research is to evaluate the measurement accuracy, cost, and refresh rate of the proposed nanosatellite scatterometers. Additional objectives study the regulatory feasibility, post-processing feasibility, and commercial feasibility. The research includes calculations of the radar signal, heat, data geolocation, cost, mass, data rate, latency, radio interference, and license feasibility. The research also includes simulations of the radar measurement geometry, the post-processing, the wind maps that will be generated by the scatterometer, as well as the constellation, its operations, and its replenishment requirements. The studies in this project answer key feasibility and performance questions posed by potential users. The results, such as data quality, availability, and simulated sample data, will be used in customer discovery to ensure the needs of potential users are met.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on providing real-time and continuous monitoring of blood pressure for patients in surgery and critical care. Currently, only 10-15% of patients undergoing surgery receive continuous blood pressure monitoring because such monitoring requires specialized skill to administer the invasive procedure and can also introduce potential complications. The remaining patients are monitored intermittently with a non-invasive blood pressure cuff, resulting in gaps in information between readings and potentially delayed response times. Rapid blood pressure drops are associated with poor patient outcomes such as organ damage/failure, post-surgical complications, and death. The success of this project has the potential to not only increase the number of surgical and critical care patients who receive continuous monitoring, improving quality of care and patient outcomes, but also to enable continuous blood pressure monitoring in other applications, such as in pre-eclampsia patients in obstetrics. This project also has commercial potential. With over 50 million surgeries performed in the US each year, the serviceable, addressable market is $2.5 billion per year. Expanded to the global market where over 230 million surgeries are performed annually, the total addressable market is over $11 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a wireless, continuous, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring device that can capture rapid fluctuations in blood pressure with high temporal resolution. Current technologies developed to address the unmet need for non-invasive, continuous blood pressure monitoring have been limited in their accuracy, cost, and ease-of-use. The research objectives to advance this project to commercial and clinical readiness are: device optimization through sensor improvement and algorithm development, form factor development for mechanical and electrical stability, and development of a smart calibration system for improved usability. Through iterative device design and testing in clinical environments, this project aims to tackle the long-standing challenges of continuous blood pressure monitoring, namely motion, calibration, and signal drift. The Phase II project outcome is a wearable, non-invasive, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device to be used in the operating room and intensive care unit. This device has the potential to not only empower clinicians with greater insight into patient condition, enabling rapid response and improved care in the clinical setting, but it can also be used to improve understanding of disease progression, treatment effectiveness, and patient stratification across demographics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help reduce sunburn (a primary risk factor for melanoma), skin cancer, and photoaging rates by helping people to apply and reapply adequate amounts of sunscreen.  Sunburns, 93% of skin cancer, and up to 90% of the age-related changes to skin are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Skin cancer is more commonly diagnosed than all other forms of cancer combined in the U.S. with estimated annual treatment costs of $8.1 billion. Sunscreen is an over-the-counter drug that can prevent the damaging effects of UVR, yet multiple studies show that sunscreen users only apply about a third of the recommended amount of sunscreen and do not reapply often enough. The recreational (beach and body) sunscreen market is $2.5 billion in the U.S. ($11 billion globally) and growing at an annual rate of 7%.  By helping people apply and reapply the correct amount of sunscreen at the right time, this project will help prevent sunburns, skin cancer, and photoaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the first accurate, affordable, and convenient sunscreen effectiveness indicator. Though other photochromic (UV-sensitive and color-changing) sunscreen effectiveness indicators exist in the marketplace, they are inaccurate (temperature and UVA1 sensitivities cause reporting errors), expensive (>$0.60 per use) and inconvenient (stickers and wristband formats) which largely account for their lack of market adoption. This project will result in the first stamp-on-skin photochromic sunscreen effectiveness indicator in two formats: a stand-alone stamp that will work with any sunscreen and a stamp-in-cap format that is built into the sunscreen?s cap. It will also result in two different photochromic ink formulations (one for use with sunscreen lotions and another for sunscreen sprays) which will be stamped onto user?s skin and accurately report?at-a-glance and in real-time the degree of users? sun protection so they can apply and reapply the right amount of sunscreen at the right time.  A single stamp will last an entire day in wet or dry conditions and withstand multiple color-fade and sunscreen reapplication cycles.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project begins with a wearable, non-invasive device providing vital brain and internal organ temperature measurements in a clinical setting that can dramatically reduce mortality and the risk of permanent brain damage for tens of thousands of patients experiencing cardiac and aortic repair surgery. This impact extends to protecting the brain from additional permanent brain injury and lifelong disability for the 4.8 million people hospitalized annually in the US after stroke, cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury and 1 million infants born with impaired blood-oxygen flow needing constant brain temperature management in their first hours of life. Finally, this technology offers a more consistent and meaningful internal body temperature measurement for millions of consumers through next generation handheld and wearable thermometers monitoring general wellness and providing advanced notice of changes in health conditions. True internal body temperature will be a powerful complement to the inevitable next generation wearable sensors that integrate many health indicators into a comprehensive and actionable snapshot of personal health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project fulfills the more than 30-year expectation that true internal body temperatures providing a meaningful metric of wellness.  Such technologies measure extremely small electromagnetic thermal noise radiated from within the body. Through the intersection of disparate microwave technologies and biological science, this novel wearable sensor became possible.  Research challenges include the development of a design methodology for an ultra-low noise receiver utilizing a near-field wearable probe, the discovery of efficient interference mitigation techniques, and the development of an algorithm for accurate and fast temperature estimation, all within a low-power wearable package. This project will develop the needed sensitivity, spatial resolution, and mitigation of the significant microwave noise from GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular and other common electronic sources. After leveraging off-the-shelf components in Phase I, the company is moving to miniaturized and specialized chips to meet the application need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel therapeutic for surgical pain that can eliminate the need for opioids after surgery. This project will yield a novel, long-acting local anesthetic drug product that can provide substantial value to customers as an affordable, safe, and effective, non-opioid, acute pain management solution. The technology can provide significant value to hospital systems, physicians, and patients alike by reducing healthcare costs associated with opioid-related adverse events and preventing opioid addiction by eliminating their use after surgery. In 2021, there was a historic rise in opioid overdose deaths to over 80,000 individuals. Opioid use disorder-related Medicaid spending has more than tripled in the last 15 years and the opioid crisis has been estimated to cost $72.4 billion during that time period. Preventing opioid addiction by reducing exposure of opioids to surgical patients can have a significant impact on reducing financial costs to society as a whole. In 2017, there were an estimated 48 million major surgical procedures requiring postoperative pain management in the United States, representing a $17 billion total addressable US market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to perform Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturing characterization and animal studies to demonstrate the novel, injectable, long-acting local anesthetic technology is safe for initial human use. The solution involves a novel oleogel-based injectable drug delivery system that can provide local sustained delivery of lipophilic small molecule drugs. In Phase I, the team optimized the technology for rheological properties, drug release kinetics, and stability to create an injectable gel that provides 96 hours of sustained bupivacaine delivery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that the proposed delivery system will advance many RNA therapeutic solutions to address intimal hyperplasia (IH) and other vascular conditions. Vascular disease is the most common disease pathology in the US, costing the country?s healthcare system over $437 billion dollars annually. Because vascular interventions have limited long-term success, there is a critical need for effective therapeutics, including to address the condition of IH which, post intervention, can lead to restenosis, or artery narrowing. By delivering therapeutics safely and efficaciously to specific tissues, the proposed technology will result in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity and, in combination with a Contact Research Organization business model, will contribute to the advancement of a multitude of RNA therapeutics targeting the vascular system and eventually other areas of the body. Eventually, the platform will contribute to the development and commercialization of a broad range of RNA drugs, creating jobs in science, sales, and manufacturing. This project will lead to improvements in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions that currently lack effective therapy, resulting in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity in the broader society.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel multifunctional lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system for tissue-specific targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics to the vascular system. Intimal hyperplasia (IH), a condition triggered by mechanical injury to blood vessels, causes artery thickening in ~ 60% of peripheral vascular disease patients 12 months post-intervention. IH often results in the need for additional surgical intervention with associated costs and increased patient morbidity and mortality. This project will focus on inhibiting the remodeling pathways that lead to IH via RNA therapeutics delivered directly to the injury site. The project will develop vascular targeting liposomes designed to exhibit multifunctional potential to target exposed collagen matrices specific to areas of vascular pathology and enhanced targeted vascular uptake/delivery. Phase I will advance the LNP technology by showing that an active therapeutic encapsulated by the system is appropriately delivered and results in a clinically relevant drug concentration. If successful at delivering bioactive RNA payloads to injured vascular tissues, the technology will reduce the risk of post-intervention complications and reduce the need for revascularization. Ultimately, this novel LNP packaging and delivery system will provide a new tool for advancing a broad range of RNA therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to commercialize a process to produce low carbon, bio-based acrylic acid and acrylates for paints, coatings, adhesives, and superabsorbent polymer markets. This $10 billion market has been seeking a bio-based, low-carbon alternative for decades, with economics serving as the major barrier. This project?s high yield lactic-to-acrylic technology will help grow the corn utilization industry and provide high paying jobs across rural America as well as economic competitiveness in global markets. Every plant constructed to convert lactic acid fermented from sugar into drop-in, low-carbon, renewable acrylic acid is estimated to bring $12 million in economic activity to a county with significant bio-based sugar crops (e.g., corn, beets, cane). Approximately 250 plants are needed at this scale to convert today?s petrochemical acrylic acid to a bio-based source.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to utilize high alcohol content feedstocks using catalyst innovation comprising engineered amine treatment of cation-exchanged zeolites. The catalyst has been shown to outperform numerous previously-utilized catalysts with >90% yields of acrylic products during catalyzed dehydration of lactic acid. So far, those in the field have investigated feeds containing aqueous solutions of methyl lactate or lactic acid in concentrations from 10-40%. Methanol has not been used as a co-feed in concentrations greater than 5%, therefore this project will investigate higher concentrations of alcohols (5%-80%, using methanol or ethanol).  The project will use both methanol and ethanol as the alcohol size is likely to alter active site reactivity and/or shift the equilibrium of esterified versus acidic acrylate products. These experiments address two areas of concern in the commercialization of the technology and determine the relative dehydration rates of ethanol and lactic acid under competitive adsorption conditions to provide foundational information required for reactor scaling. The proposed research also increases the percentage of alkyl acrylates formed by forcing the gas phase esterification of acrylic acid with alcohol towards completion.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new domestic commercial source of enriched lithium isotopes.  The U.S. nuclear power industry requires enriched lithium-7 hydroxide to prevent corrosion in its present fleet of pressurized water reactors.  Currently, this strategic material is supplied outside the U.S. and recent supply disruptions jeopardize 20% of the U.S. electrical generation capability. Longer term, the development of safer, lower-impact, new technologies for nuclear power generation is critical to meet the U.S. and global goals of reducing carbon emissions. One of the most promising technologies, molten salt reactors, will require commercial production of large quantities of enriched lithium-7. Even longer term, many of the fusion energy technologies in development will require enriched lithium-6. The planned production of lithium isotopes will enable the development and commercialization of safer, lower-impact nuclear energy.

    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project proposes the implementation of a liquid/liquid extraction method for lithium enrichment in a pilot-scale production system.  To date, this type of extraction has not been employed for commercial lithium isotope enrichment. The Phase II work will result in the design of the first commercial-scale production process. The innovative approach to lithium isotope enrichment will also have applicability in the purification of other stable isotopes.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The commercial/broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide economic benefits, health advantages, and improved natural disaster response readiness to the USA. Historically, natural resource and conservation organizations have had difficulties mapping their targeted ecosystems, whether due to high costs of manual surveys or poor resolution of imaging technologies. Annually, organizations spend more than $27 billion on geospatial monitoring and analysis. This Phase II project will decrease the cost of ecosystem mapping while increasing resolution, allowing for the best quality vegetation health tracking available. Additionally, this project will result in a 50-90% reduction in work hours for natural resource mapping. By saving time, stakeholders can allocate effort to other aspects of natural resource management. By mapping land use over time, managers and conservationists can track land changes and determine if currently-implemented programs are having intended impacts on the ecosystem. This project will also improve monitoring and managing of vegetation across watersheds that provide roughly 80% of US drinking water - systems where water quality relies on healthy and biodiverse vegetation to filter pollutants. Lastly, this project will improve the ability of government agencies to rapidly monitor environmental impacts of natural disasters and inform responses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a comprehensive software system that can provide unparalleled spectral and spatial detail on diverse landscape scenes. Compared to current labor-intensive field testing, this project?s outputs will offer scene characterization at comparable, or better, levels of detail, while surmounting the time, cost, and accessibility constraints that have historically precluded comprehensive and repetitive monitoring. Accomplishment of these Phase II goals will yield a user-friendly land cover mapping system that will enable high-resolution environmental monitoring. System outputs on population dynamics, climate change-induced vegetation shifts, and disease assessments can facilitate data-driven decision-making for precision ecosystem management and climate action. The framework of the innovation consists of three main components: 1) image pre-processing and alteration, 2) image segmentation, and 3) resolution recovery. This approach provides rapid replicability between ecosystem types and versatile scalability due to processing efficiency, while providing currently unavailable ecosystem health indicators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is expanding global deployment of wind turbines with increased production not obtainable with today?s fixed blades. An adaptable blade with advanced control capabilities helps solve technical and scientific challenges as wind projects accelerate their move offshore, extending the physics of the larger turbines needed for future wind farms. Developing a high-fidelity modeling tool to design morphing blades capable of boosting energy production, reducing wear and tear, dampening vibration, improving stability, and reducing load effectively achieves two crucial goals.  These goals include accelerating the deployment of renewable energy with affordable electricity that is efficiently and economically extracted from wind and improving the loading and stability necessary for the development of floating wind farms capable of installation in challenging water depths and extreme weather. The technology proposed makes large turbines better at capturing wind in more locations to protect against volatile energy prices, generate jobs, and promote greater participation in the global energy transition for developed and developing countries alike. Furthermore, the blade technology resulting from this research provides opportunities for new manufacturing techniques and commercial applications in other industries such as aviation, automotive, and marine renewable energy.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to examine a high-fidelity model to support the design and control of an advanced wind turbine blade configuration with an adaptive twist angle distribution (TAD). Conventional control is generally applied to rotor torque to maximize wind capture, and thus production, below the rated wind speed. Above this speed, control shifts to the blade pitch angle to maintain full power. However, limitations in existing designs lead to trade-offs where wind capture or power production is relinquished to reduce loads, mitigate vibration, and improve stability. The actively adaptive TAD provides greater control capabilities and satisfies these objectives without trade-offs. A crucial goal of this research is the means to understand the complex aeroelastic and aerodynamic relationships with respect to the TAD. The technology is a high-fidelity model that simulates these dynamics and the aeroelastic performance in a reasonable amount of time. This model involves the development of a framework combining these dynamics and uses computational tools that leverage data analytics and machine learning. The technical result of the proposed work is the creation of a digital twin that enables effective design and robust control of highly sophisticated blades with adaptive TAD.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide low-cost hydrogen (H2) with a very low or even negative carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint at a commercial production cost reaching $1.50 per kg of H2 alongside a valuable solid carbon by-product, representing a technology advance for the American public and economy. The United States produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year - 95% of it via steam methane reforming (SMR).  SMR emits 100 million tons of CO2 in the process. This represents a >$10 billion market in the US alone and an important opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions. Methane pyrolysis promises green hydrogen with >5 times less energy than water electrolysis at costs competitive with steam methane reforming by producing solid carbon instead of gaseous carbon dioxide. The solid carbon, if produced correctly, can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete. The research in this project could increase the value of the solid carbon by-product produced alongside clean hydrogen in methane pyrolysis. If successful, this technology could lead to expanded domestic production capabilities with net-zero emissions from sectors such as fertilizer, transportation (batteries, fuel cells, synthetic fuels, and tires), and heavy industry (steel and cement).

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method to tune the production of high-quality solid carbon using methane pyrolysis. Carbon black forms in pyrolysis reactors both homogeneously in the gas phase and heterogeneously on catalysts, reactor walls, and on seed particles entrained in the gas. By tuning temperature, residence time, flow profile, and seed materials, this project will result in an improved understanding of carbon precipitation and formation in methane pyrolysis reactors. This improved understanding and the development of a reactor thermochemical model will ultimately lead to better control of a process to produce high quality solid carbon that can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing high-efficiency, low-cost, crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells without using silicon wafers. For the first time, additive manufacturing processes will be applied to silicon in order to produce equivalent performance to silicon wafers without the wasteful processes used in current manufacturing. If successful, this additive approach can link the parts of the solar supply chain that still exist in the United States?silicon refining and solar module assembly, establishing a full domestic supply chain for this critical energy technology. This supply chain can: (a) be built with off-the-shelf equipment at a third the cost of building traditional silicon wafer and cell factories, (b) cut the cost of photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing in half compared to imported silicon wafer-based solar cells, and (c) reduce energy consumption in solar cell manufacturing by 70% and reduce water consumption by 90%.  This combination of low factory and production costs can drive the growth needed in the solar industry to support the nation?s decarbonization goals while creating tens of thousands of domestic jobs.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel architecture and additive manufacturing process for crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells that provide equivalent performance to traditional silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost with a local supply chain. The steps in the process flow are adapted from traditional solar cell processing or adjacent industries like microelectronics, but they are being combined in new way to realize this solar cell design. These steps will be co-optimized to produce high-efficiency cells using a series of designed experiments. These processes typically fall into three categories: (1) chemical or physical vapor deposition, (2) solution-based coating, and (3) thermal annealing, with their own relevant process variables: (a) time, temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, and magnetic power; (b) solvent, solution concentration, coating gap, and coating speed; (c) temperature vs. time. These process variables for each step will be correlated to physical properties of the layers in the cell stack such as thickness, stoichiometry, and performance of the finished cells to produce a prototype with performance that is compelling to investors, partners, and customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is derived from providing energy self-sufficiency to residential buildings. Fire-safe and low-cost redox flow batteries, combined with rooftop solar panels or backyard wind turbines, can meet the increased electricity needs of American families without relying on the national grid. During the daytime, solar arrays convert solar energy to chemical energy in batteries. During evenings, batteries will power houses and charge electric vehicles in family garages. Batteries play a critical role in harvesting and storing clean electricity for residential uses. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, the improved fire-safety profiles and reduced production costs of flow batteries will give homeowners peace of mind and allow the wider adoption of clean energy by society.

    This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop novel proton-conductive polymeric membranes that show reduced metal electrolyte crossovers and build the first 7 kW flow battery system that meets the energy need of a single-family house. To this end, the project will synthesize a group of phosphorylated polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) that have a phosphoric acid side chain. Such phosphoric acid groups can form unique zirconium phosphonate clusters that transport protons but deny the unwanted migration of metal cations. PBIs provide mechanical support to the zirconium-phosphate clusters. Zirconium and PBIs are bulk materials that cost significantly less than commercial perfluorosulfonic acids. The second task of this phase I project is to construct a 7 kW iron-titanium redox flow battery system. The peak electricity demand for the average American single-family house is around 7 kW. Such a battery will be connected to a rooftop solar system to meet residential electricity demands. The team plans to study various cell configuration designs. In particular, the project will focus on examining the effects of solvent channels of bipolar plates on the performance of the stack. In addition, other design parameters, such as pump flow rates and the choice of sealant materials, will be thoroughly investigated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make oil exploration and production (E&P) operations less risky and economically and technically more efficient. The new technology has the potential to achieve significant reductions in oil exploration drilling costs.  The technology will also increase long-term commercial benefits for exploration and production companies due to more accurate and reliable estimates of the recoverable reserves and production planning over the decades-long reservoir lifecycle.  These benefits will support global economic growth by ensuring a continued supply of hydrocarbons for the US and internationally during the critical transition to renewable energies. The new technology being developed under this SBIR project will also reduce the environmental impact, energy consumption, and overall carbon footprint of offshore/onshore E&P operations by reducing waste, pollution, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby directly benefiting future generations. Successful completion of the project will further reinforce the leadership of the US in utilization of advanced hydrocarbon E&P technologies and support the goal of energy independence from global markets by making US producers more effective and competitive.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of determining volumetric (3D) hydrocarbon distribution throughout large-diameter long cores with high spatial resolution (10 mm3), 95% accuracy, and 1 meter/hour throughput at the offshore/onshore wellsite. Today, this is not possible with any technology, i.e., logging data can be used to derive hydrocarbon estimates on a sparse set of points along the wellbore, while ?special core analysis? at onshore laboratories takes weeks to complete. Neither of the current techniques can closely match the resolution and accuracy offered by the proposed solution. The disruptive innovation of this development is to combine 3-dimensional (3D) X-ray Multi-Energy Computed Tomography (MECT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in one wellsite core scanning instrument, thereby allowing for novel, synergistic combination of the information provided by the MECT and EIT modalities. Algorithms will be developed to combine the complementary datasets to yield 3D hydrocarbon distribution in the cores in near real-time. These algorithms will be tested on realistic digital core models. The ultimate goal of Phase I is to demonstrate that the specified target accuracy, spatial resolution, and scanning-imaging throughput for assessing 3D distribution of hydrocarbons in large cores can be achieved with the new wellsite instrument.

    \ Phase I project is the development of a platform technology that enables a novel\

    \ a new class of microbial biopesticides that precisely target and kill crop pathogens\
    \ without adversely affecting beneficial microbes, insect pollinators, or humans.\
    \ With an initial focus on treating tomatoes (320,000 acres in the US, $32 million\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to overcome a limiting step in creating viable hydrogen fuel cells for the automotive industry. The solution will renew the battery catalyst without its removal from the vehicle. This will result in significant savings toward the total cost of ownership and an increase in overall system reliability, one of the top features potential customers evaluate when making automotive purchasing decisions. The transportation industry has been seeking innovations to transition to sustainable solutions such as zero-emission and green hydrogen fuel cell technologies, but the broad adoption of such vehicles is limited by the short lifespan of fuel cell electrocatalysts that operate, expensive fuel cell stack replacements, and the high costs of components. This project will make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles viable and cost-competitive with diesel and gasoline engine vehicles by extending the lifetime of the electrocatalyst and thereby the fuel cell stack. Such alternative options are needed, as diesel vehicles are responsible for around 20% of anthropogenic pollution precursor emissions, and these emissions are linked to approximately 110,000 premature deaths per year.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish a proof-of-concept approach for in-stack platinum electrocatalyst renewal. Since fuel cell electrocatalysts degrade during operation, this project will develop a breakthrough technology that enables the reuse of what was once considered expended, end-of-life fuel cells by renewing the electrocatalyst.  This renewal process can be conducted multiple times after the electrocatalyst inevitably degrades, increasing the lifetime and durability for fuel cell operation. As one of the most expensive precious metals, platinum typically used as the catalyst for automotive applications contributes to about 60% of the total fuel cell cost. This process is the first-in-kind to allow electrocatalyst renewal at the surface of the electrode without removing or replacing the fuel cell stack. This project will establish working parameters for the electrocatalyst renewal and analyze the effects of the process using a custom testing apparatus with a 3-electrode configuration and on commercial fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies in custom single-cell configurations. This team will utilize several techniques including analytical electrochemistry, microscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques to verify the effects of the process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide the refrigerant industry with the first commercial designs for separating complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures for economical recycling. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase down production and consumption of refrigerants causing global warming by 85 percent over 15 years. The societal, economical, and environmental benefits are estimated to create thousands of jobs and increase manufacturing by billions of dollars in the U.S. while reducing venting and incineration, and subsequently global temperature rise. There are millions of metric tons of mixed refrigerants that cannot be reclaimed using current fractional distillation technology. The proposed ionic liquid extractive distillation technology will make possible the separation and reuse of these complex refrigerant mixtures. The startup company funded through this project will provide a novel separation technology to the refrigerant industry that is of strategic national interest. Outreach activities, especially toward the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities will be supported through this project.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate that complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures can be separated using ionic liquids, and that the products can meet industry standard specifications. Refrigerant mixture R-404A, used broadly throughout the commercial refrigeration industry (e.g., grocery stores) is a complex, ternary azeotropic mixture containing HFC-143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), which has a high global warming potential. HFC-143a will be one of the first refrigerants to be reused in new low global warming blends containing hydrofluoroolefins if the HFC-143a can be economically separated. Over 100 complex, multicomponent refrigerant mixtures exist in the market. This project will enable the development of processes, technologies, and systems designs required for industry to meet and exceed the phase down goals. The program objectives include the separation of R-404A into components, the creation of a process model, and testing of recovered R-404A from industry to understand the effects of impurities. The results will be used to develop a technoeconomic model and commercial scale designs that the team will build and/or license to the refrigerant industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable an environmentally sustainable, reduced-carbon emissions steelmaking process for the iron and steel industry.  This industry is responsible for 7%~9% of global carbon emissions. The proposed innovation will produce no solid waste discharge and no greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the proposed innovation will contribute to the United States and society by reducing the use of precious mineral resources and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Once this innovation is proved to be successful and scalable, it can be commercialized and massively applied to the American iron and steelmaking industry, with the potential to reduce dependency on steel imports, provide greater resilience to the US manufacturing sector, and reduce the carbon footprint.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing reduced-carbon emissions steel using Super-Pure Iron Ore Powder (SPIOP) and hydrogen. Steel is ubiquitous in our lives, from bridges and skyscrapers to cars and consumer goods. Yet, producing steel often comes with a long flow sheet, high cost, waste, and pollution. The proposed innovative process uses hydrogen (H2) to directly reduce SPIOP in a high-temperature hydrogen reduction electric furnace to produce steel. The raw iron ore is first ground to a fine target size range (~0-0.076mm) to dissociate iron ore particles from gangue/impure particles such as quartz and rocks. The dissociated iron ore particles are then purified using the company?s high-intensity iron separation technologies. The purified iron ore concentrate is >99.0% purity. The hydrogen reduction process and direct reduced iron melting process occur in the same furnace, producing a one-step crude steel manufacturing process.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is in improving both student learning and workforce readiness through interdependent learning experiences. The project will create project-based environments that promote skills such as communication, critical thinking, problem solving, time management, creativity, and teamwork ? all mirroring professional work environments. The technology will also promote development of skills such as project management, writing, business and data analysis, design, and presentation. Project collaboration requires that students interact frequently throughout the project completion process, including frequent mentor or teacher interactions. Such an interdependent environment creates a real-world dynamic that better prepares students to enter the workforce. The platform developed by this project is likely to create significant societal impact while participating in the fastest growing e-learning sector.

    The proposal seeks to develop a collaborative community platform using proprietary project collaboration models integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) augmented mentorship to enhance student workforce readiness. The technology will be designed to provide the right piece of information to the students and mentors at the right time. By analyzing and unifying all the content under a domain-specific semantic representation, the system will be able to aggregate and organize all the content and identify the piece for intervention that is contextually most useful.  To make project collaboration and mentorship easier between students and mentors in a trustworthy manner, modeling will be done utilizing minimal supervision. This modelling will include combining contextual embeddings from language models with graph-based neural networks to capture interactions across multiple facets.  The technology will build upon explainability of deep neural networks to provide an appropriate level of transparency into the decision making, both for the users to learn to trust the platform, as well as for the platform developers to build systems that aid in reliable, trustworthy, and fair mentoring.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that a deeper structural understanding will be developed of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), an important target for promising new anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory drugs. The project will also support the development of new compounds targeting PAR1 with the potential for improved potency and safety profiles. Such compounds could represent a new drug class for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, including kidney disease.

    The proposed project involves the confirmation of the binding site on PAR1 of small molecule ligands called parmodulins. A detailed characterization of this binding site will support the rapid design, synthesis, and testing of new and improved parmodulins with superior properties as oral medications. A combination of computational, structural biology, and synthetic methods will be combined with PAR1 cell assays to confirm the binding site and develop more detailed structure-activity relationships of the parmodulins. It is also anticipated that novel parmodulins will be identified in this project with improved safety and stability profiles.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase post-secondary student success via academic and career guidance. A large body of research on career navigation has studied how post-secondary education, career readiness (understanding viable career paths at graduation), and its interconnectedness are important for a growing number of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. With increasing undergraduate degree program offerings in response to an evolving future of work and student-to-counselor ratios of 1: 1,800 in public colleges, career guidance, and academic navigation risk being unavailable. As a result, during the pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHEs) that serve students of color and students from low-income backgrounds saw declines in enrollment that far outpaced their predominantly White peer institutions. The proposed platform intends to increase the visibility, accessibility, and discoverability of competencies to potential career and academic paths for students at IHEs. The platform envisions doing this via near-peer role models who are similar in their dimensions of self-efficacy. With more than 85 million jobs that could go unfilled by 2030, the proposed platform may help alleviate part of that shortage by widening the talent aperture.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the company?s patented technology of a unified, multi-dimensional, data representation model that creates a ?competency fingerprint? for each user. The data representation method enables better machine learning models to ?infer? competency from unstructured data of a student?s traditional and non-traditional learning experience, rather than degrees, majors, grade point averages (GPAs), or test scores. The platform uses a consistent, scalable, competency nomenclature for hard and soft skills gained via traditional academic and outside-of-the-classroom experiences to discover academic-career paths where the students? learning competencies may be in demand. There is a significant technical challenge in adopting this technology for the inter/cross-disciplinary jobs of the future:  such a platform requires a robust, larger data set to evaluate the relevance of matching, in a discipline-agnostic context. Reduction of this variability is the key technical risk to be overcome by the proposed research and development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology enabling low-energy, resilient cooling that is capable of mitigating the environmental impacts and high costs of conventional refrigeration. There is a critical need for sustainable cooling solutions that provide an alternative to hydrofluorocarbon-based refrigerants that rely on carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting systems. This project seeks to develop a Hydrologic Open Cooling System (HOCS) that can maintain cooling chambers at 1.5-5°C utilizing 10% or less of the electrical power of conventional systems. This project unlocks environmental heat as an energy reservoir and offsets significant energy costs of conventional cooling systems. The technology can support highly efficient refrigeration at a fraction of the operational cost and electrical demand of traditional systems. Adoption of this cooling technology by small- to mid-size supermarkets would enable significant cost savings for electricity. On a broader scale, widespread implementation of this innovation across a variety of refrigeration applications would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, meeting the need for sustainable technologies to support food and energy security while upholding climate goals.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a renewable, closed container cooling system incorporating a rechargeable vacuum insulation and a novel two-stage heat pump. This project involves 1) developing a rechargeable vacuum insulation technology that does not use vacuum pumps; 2) creating a modified dewar connected to a fully renewable cooling system enabling cooled inner chambers; and 3) evaluating the ability to use environmental heat to restore the solutions that power the cooling system allowing their reuse. The novel heat pump technology is based on two asynchronous stages: the first utilizes concentration gradients as a driving mechanism enabling thermal transfer, while the second uses environmental heat to re-concentrate saline solutions after dilution during stage one. Together, these two stages enable cooling of a closed container. The project will examine system configurations able to generate large thermal gradients, enabling maintenance of 1.5-5°C temperatures within the dewar. Advantages of this system include 1) the system?s ability to cool continues in the absence of electricity making it resilient to power outages from itinerant weather, wildfires, and earthquakes; 2) lossless storage of cooling capacity; and 3) significantly reducing the greenhouse gas footprint compared to conventional refrigeration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is reducing fuel consumption, improving safety and stability, and reducing the carbon footprint of the trucking industry while increasing profitability. Over 70% of US freight tonnage is moved by trucks. At highway speeds, aerodynamic drag uses over 65% of the total vehicle energy. The proposed device modifies the aerodynamic behavior of semi-trucks using air injection by allowing continuous optimization of aerodynamic performance. This project will bring the pneumatic, sensor and artificial intelligence (AI) control systems from proof-of-concept to commercialization. Having a commercial product capable of determining and delivering the trailer?s best aerodynamic profile based on real-time operating conditions may be a game-changer for the trucking industry, as fuel is a significant operating cost. Commercializing this system has the potential to create an energy savings for all US fleets, saving more than 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel, reducing the release of more than 33.5 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, tripling trucking company profits, and saving an annual $22 billion.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes development of an aerodynamic add-on prototype for semi-trucks to save fuel by dynamically changing the trailer?s aerodynamic profile to accommodate diverse operating conditions. Objectives of this SBIR Project are to evolve the device from prototype to the first commercially viable release through system miniaturization and encapsulation, controller optimization, and improved overall system performance, reliability, and safety. Research conducted to miniaturize the overall system footprint will minimize any additional operational impacts, ensuring widespread adoption and utilization that maximizes fuel savings. Research to optimize the Artificial Intelligence-Controller operation will maximize fuel savings because it will allow the device to operate under a broader set of operational conditions. Further development to improve system performance, reliability, and the addition of a safety assist will improve the profit margins of the trucking industry while simultaneously improving on-road safety for the public. The project seeks to deliver 10% savings in operational costs for the trucking industry while improving the efficiency and safety of their country-wide operations.

    \ (UHF) RFID tags that are already attached to clothing, footwear, and apparel\
    \ items. In contrast to existing mobile solutions which can only detect RFID-tagged\
    \ items, the team's handheld device leverages sophisticated signal excitation\
    \ and processing techniques to pin down each RFID?s exact position with decimeter-scale\
    \ accuracy. \n\nThis SBIR Phase 1 project will build a system capable of identifying\
    \ and precisely locating RFID-tagged items and includes three main innovative\
    \ components: (1) a portable, handheld wireless device for locating RFIDs, (2)\
    \ a scalable cloud and edge computing platform to process and store the data,\
    \ and (3) a mobile and web user interface for accessing the data and optimizing\
    \ picking tasks for retail store associates. Realizing the end-to-end platform\
    \ requires developing efficient sensor fusion algorithms and low-power, low-cost\
    \ hardware for accurate, robust, and low-latency localization. This technology\
    \ necessitates addressing challenges that arise from the computational, memory,\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a novel solution for air filter monitoring that will have a positive impact on public health, the environment, and the US economy. The technology is based upon the direct measurement of the filter status using photosensors, smart signal processing algorithms for accurate filter soiling condition determination using the sensor data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for control and communication. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Ambient air pollution kills about 3 million people annually... About 90 percent of the world's population is exposed to levels exceeding WHO limits." While air-filtration technology alone cannot solve the overwhelming problem of ambient air pollution, it must be an integral part of a comprehensive solution. With data driven decision making to eliminate premature filter replacement and to reduce costs, the proposed technology will propel the usage of high-quality filters more ubiquitously, leading to enhanced public health. With 150 million heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in operation, and quarterly filter replacement, an estimated 600 million filters are manufactured and thrown away every year. A reduction of 50% of the filter waste will have a significant positive impact on the environment because of reduced manufacturing and waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage the accuracy of photosensors in detecting the degree of filter blockage by sensing transmitted light through the filter. Underlying the seemingly straightforward solution is a set of complex technical challenges. Due to the uneven structure including pleats and frame obstructions, the sensor data are inherently noisy. A software-controlled actuator will place the sensor in front of the filter and take data from multiple locations of the filter. A smart algorithm will be developed to extract a parameter from the analysis of the data set that would be an accurate proxy for the particle size removal efficiency defined in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard which in turn is expected to be a sufficiently accurate indicator of the true filter age. Using the IoT capability, the sensor data will be collected in the cloud, where the smart algorithm and control software will be stored. The final objective is to determine the optimum point for filter replacement by comparing the parameter with a threshold parameter derived from a predetermined maximum particle size removal efficiency and airflow resistance based on indoor air quality requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to enhance the safety of micro-mobility vehicles and fleets (bicycles, electronic bikes, and electric scooters). Micro-mobility has a high potential to reduce congestion, emissions, and noise pollution in urban settings.  These vehicles can address many first- and last-mile transportation challenges. The technology developed in this project will integrate low-cost sensors, advanced machine learning and model-based algorithms with Internet of Things (IOT)-based technologies for micro-mobility safety devices. Furthermore, IOT-based early detection and warning systems can address safety concerns in the use of micro-mobility, resulting in the development of strong ecosystems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop and evaluate a cost-effective. innovative, IOT technology and turn it into a product and service that are essential to the safety and reliability of the micro-mobility vehicles and fleets. The technology involves predicting likely future failures in vehicle braking components and systems in advance of their occurrence as well as early detection of hazardous driving conditions (due to misbehavior of riders, road conditions, or weather conditions).  The solution will issue warnings to the rider and proactive alerts with actionable recommendations (e.g., for proactive maintenance). The project will develop and evaluate model-based and machine-learning-assisted algorithms for the detection, isolation, and prediction of failures and hazardous driving conditions as well as the associated level of confidence in the accuracy of the decisions. The performance of the safety device and operation under experimental conditions and constraints will be evaluated using end-to-end simulation and a testbed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing technology that will enable the use of a 3-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system in smaller and more economical drones for mapping, surveying, and navigation.  The 3D LiDAR has important applications in environment management, forestry, land and corridor mapping, construction, land surveying, precision agriculture, powerline and infrastructure inspection, and countless other areas. The technology will bring significant economic impacts to the industries by reducing the ownership costs of a high-performance LiDAR system and the drone that can carry this system. The reduction of the entry-cost for LiDAR applications with drones will in turn benefit small businesses to perform smaller-scale projects in mapping and surveying. Other than drone-based applications, the innovation is poised to significantly reduce the costs and provide seamless integration of 3D LiDAR sensing in self-driving vehicles and other industrial applications including robotics, smart city infrastructure, surveillance, and security, as well as consumer applications like 3D sensing for augmented reality. The numerous applications enabled by the proposed project not will only help increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. but also improve quality of life, security and safety.

    The proposed project aims at developing a high-performance, compact, and light-weight 3D LiDAR sensor to meet the increasing needs of drone-based, high-precision LiDAR applications. Current commercial high-performance drone-LiDAR systems are notorious for their high cost, bulkiness, heavy weight, and high power-consumption.  Current drone-LiDAR systems are also prone to mechanical damage. These issues inevitably shorten the drone flight time, inhibit the installations of high-performance LiDAR systems on the more common consumer-grade small drones, and increase the operation costs. The proposed LiDAR sensor will mitigate all of these issues by leveraging a high-performance coherent LiDAR detection approach with silicon photonics technology in an innovative design. The coherent LiDAR detection method allows more sensitive measurements than the method used in most existing LiDAR systems. The technology achieves a longer detection range and larger number of returns given the same laser power. Based on highly scalable Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon photonics technology, the LiDAR sensor is able to achieve high spatial resolution in a compact size. The entire system will have a form-factor similar to a palm-sized compact camera commonly used for photogrammetry in small drones. The solution requires no mechanical mechanisms for beam scanning nor high-precision alignment of optical components, making the system inherently durable, compact, lightweight, and power efficient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be low-emissivity windows capable of allowing wireless signals to pass through. Presently, almost all commercial low-emissivity windows severely block mobile signals from entering buildings - a serious problem in today's world that demands fast and uninterrupted mobile connectivity. The proposed low-emissivity windows can be manufactured cost-competitively and significantly reduce the costs of installing indoor cellular aids such as routers and antennas. This technology will accelerate the further adoption of low-emissivity windows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as support the further deployment of 5G technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate scalable manufacturing of mobile, signal transmissive, low-emissivity windows by using lithographic deposition of photoresist structures on the glass substrate prior to low-emissivity vacuum coating. The project proposes to deposit photoresist structures with non-conductive spacers on glass substrate, reducing the low-emissivity coating?s electric conductivity that prevents wireless signal passthrough. Dielectric layers will be deposited over the sidewalls to form protective layers over the low-emissivity coatings to protect against oxidative corrosion. The width of the photoresist structures will range between 2 to 5 micrometers to minimize the degradation of low-emissivity coatings to less than 2%, to maintain thermal performance. After low-emissivity coating deposition, the non-planar spacers will subsequently collapse into the photoresist layer restoring low-emissivity coatings to their original planar position thereby rendering the photoresist structure invisible to the eye. Furthermore, the team will explore additional photoresist designs to address potential lighting diffractions that may form on the finished window.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make available to the public a new imaging device that provides the anatomical and functional information necessary for effective and efficient diagnosis of breast cancer in women with dense breasts. The device employs a novel design and method of generating high-quality, three-dimensional images of the breast anatomy comfortably and at low levels of radiation dose. By design, the device will occupy a small space and support fast and efficient patient imaging. When commercialized, it can be priced on par with existing x-ray-based imaging technologies. Given these benefits and the large existing need nationwide need for a thorough dense-breast imaging solution, there is significant commercial potential. The prime objective of the project is to significantly increase the sensitivity and specificity in cancer radiological studies of women with dense breasts. Accordingly, this device has the potential to become the next generation breast cancer imaging modality of choice for small clinics as well as large hospitals, available to both patients and clinicians everywhere imaging is performed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development and validation of a comfortable, effective, dense-breast cancer imaging device built upon a new method and design for Computed Tomography (CT). This CT-based device does not require breast compression, and is smaller, faster, and higher in spatial resolution than alternative 3-dimensional imaging technologies. The instrument will provide spectral information used to distinguish deadly from non-deadly cancers from both dense and non-dense tissues across the entire breast, including regions near the chest and underarm. Nearly 50% of the U.S. female population has dense breasts. The most widely used technologies for breast imaging today ?Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ? underserve these women. This technology cannot reliably image breast regions near the chest and underarm where cancers occur.  Current methods also cannot reliably distinguish healthy, but dense, breast tissue from cancer. During this SBIR project, testing and validation of the developed device will be carried out using human-like surrogates called anthropomorphic phantoms. The company will demonstrate that this new technology provides high quality dense-tissue imaging, consistent whole-breast imaging, and spectral information that is of clinical benefit in cancer detection and diagnosis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the basis for advancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hardware solutions for ultra-fast image acquisition. The proposed effort will target clinical MRI scanners where there is limited MRI access by a large patient population. Long scan times reduce the efficiency of radiology department processes and increase the overall cost to clinics and patients. A successful solution which decreases scan times by half will provide improved patient access and care, especially with regard to measuring metabolic activities, brain activity, and cognition.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high resolution MRI as a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity in humans and animals. High dielectric constant (HDC) materials provide a low impedance pathway between the patient and magnetic coil of the MRI. The goal of this project is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRI by over 50%, thereby cutting the scan time by half.  The HDC materials will have an immediate impact on animal and human behavior studies where neuroscientists are using MRI techniques to monitor brain activity and cognition.  An integrated development approach includes electromagnetic simulation, ceramic processing, and phantom testing.  A working prototype will be tested in clinical MRI scanners thus creating an innovative ecosystem comprised of original equipment manufacturers, hospitals, and researchers with clinical experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is abating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the production of terephthalic acid, a large-scale commodity chemical.  Development of this technology will provide a pathway for direct utilization of CO2 in everyday products. For example, implemented at scale, the proposed process has potential to sequester about 20 million metric tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to the emissions from 4.3 million cars. This project also has significant commercial potential. By delivering a lower-carbon product at lower cost than the current technology, the proposed innovation has the potential to become the de facto standard for manufacturing this commodity chemical. Annual licensing and ancillary revenue from a single plant is estimated at $30 million, and at 70-80% market share, typical for the dominant process, annual revenue could grow to over $1.5 billion. The success of this project will also provide a scientific and entrepreneurial blueprint to spur similar efforts thus advancing the state of the art of CO2 utilization technologies.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a light-driven chemical technology that enables the use of CO2 as a raw material in large scale chemical production of terephthalic acid. This project abates CO2 emissions by converting CO2, captured from point sources such as industrial flue stacks or direct air capture, to useful chemical and consumer products. Carbon dioxide is a stable compound and is typically unreactive and therefore incompatible with traditional heat-driven processes. The proposed project will help mature the technology of CO2 activation by photocatalysis, which has been shown to be effective in inducing CO2 reactivity. The first step is to demonstrate the feasibility of using CO2 to produce the target chemical at bench scale. Next, the reaction performance will be optimized using high-throughput experimentation techniques. Finally, the process will be scaled up in a photo flow photoreactor. In this part of the project, engineering scale up issues will be addressed as a precursor to realizing a production plant.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly reduce administrative inefficiency in pharmaceutical benefit management processing. The specific focus is on prior authorization processing, where payers and prescribers must reach a consensus on medical necessity. The project delivers a solution to optimize prescription authorization and provide more comprehensive patient histories for clinical authorization criteria fulfillment than other available products on the current health technology market. Lack of efficient access to reliable patient histories is the principal reason for delayed authorizations, resulting in delayed care access. A 2022 survey showed 93% of physicians reported that prior authorization often or always creates care delays; 82% reported delays that led to treatment abandonment. A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support. The expected result is improved real-time insight into clinical risk, affording payers the ability to financially and strategically adapt to patient needs with increasing precision and agility.

    \ Isomers are molecules with the same constituent atoms but arranged differently.\
    \ The identification of isomers and their conformational forms is of critical\

    \ or pulled by the fields depending on their orientations in the field and the\
    \ magnitude of their polarity (?dipole moment?).  Since molecular isomers weigh\
    \ the same, their identification via mass spectrometry is complicated and typically\
    \ requires time-consuming ?method development? work. The proposed instrument aims\
    \ to reduce this work by using dipole moments to distinguish all isomers and their\
    \ conformers in a single spectrum ? with an axis labeled by mass-to-dipole-moment\
    \ ratio, rather than mass-to-charge ratio. This technology uses microfabrication\
    \ techniques to miniaturize and planarize a previously demonstrated quadrupole\
    \ device described in the academic literature, creating an array of microscopic\
    \ quadrupole channels. The additional patent-pending deceleration feature, coupled\
    \ with velocity selective detection, should result in 2-to-3 orders of magnitude\
    \ higher isomer/conformer discrimination capabilities over the literature device.\
    \ Finally, this universal detection methodology will allow for continuous throughput,\
    \ which is ideal for interfacing with standard analytical instrumentation.\n\n\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop transformative, machine-learning algorithms that will improve water management. Water management is critically important to the social well-being, food supply, and climate resiliency of the local population in the Western United States, yet water managers lack adequate snowpack depth and water content information necessary for the management, storage, and transfer of water for irrigation and consumption. Water deficits are made worse when snowpack depths are in error, potentially resulting in devastating damage to agricultural economies and vulnerable populations. The proposed technology will be able to scale from storm events to seasonal snowpack estimations and provide accurate mappings of snowpack depths and water equivalents for watershed areas needing water management.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops algorithms for determining snowpack depth and water content. Snow retrieval algorithm development has not kept pace with the deployment of short wavelengths.  C- and X-band radars are used as ?gap-filling? radars in mountainous valleys. Developing effective algorithms for detection of snow water equivalent is needed for these short wavelength radars. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and optimization algorithms are expected to improve estimation accuracy compared with point-scale (sensor) observations and across watershed areas relevant to water management. Physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) can produce physically consistent results and generalize to out of sample scenarios. Application of a PGNN to snow retrievals is expected to perform better than purely data-driven or deterministic algorithms. Anticipated technical results will provide water managers with a cloud-based subscription service updated in real-time, using historical and current radar data to improve operational decision-making.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the efficiency and performance of electronic devices. Modern devices, including cell phones, laptops, and electric vehicles contain high-powered semiconductor components which generate unwanted heat that, in turn, reduces their efficiency. If left unchecked, this heat may destroy the devices and even injure users or cause damage to the environment. This project addresses excessing heating in electronic devices by introducing new high-performance thermal interface materials based upon embedding liquid metal droplets inside of stretchable polymers. These so-called liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) materials can be applied to computer processors, graphics cards, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and even power modules in electric vehicles, to help keep electronic devices operating at peak performance at all times. The growing prevalence of the Internet of Things, 5G network infrastructure, and electric cars all necessitate better thermal solutions so that devices can function properly. This project could contribute to the semiconductor, automotive, and healthcare industries.

    This project?s goal is to develop and commercialize a thermal interface material (TIM) for packaged microelectronics, building upon the LMEE composite architecture.  The technology will outperform existing TTIMs by combining the superior thermal resistance of metal-based solid TIMs (S-TIMs) with the mechanical reliability of polymer-based TIMs and the high-volume manufacturing compatibility of thermal greases.  Specifically, LMEEs possess a unique combination of metal-like thermal resistance, rubber-like elasticity, and liquid emulsion-like rheology prior to curing, thereby solving two main challenges present with existing S-TIMs: (i) poor mechanical reliability over long durations and (ii) incompatibility with syringe-based dispensing for high volume manufacturing.  The strategy proposed in this project is to synthesize an LMEE-based TIM that forms a robust bond between the surfaces of the semiconductor chip and surrounding enclosure, maintains a controlled thickness between the chip and enclosure, and ensures the necessary rheology for syringe-based dispensing.  Specific project tasks build around a comprehensive technical plan that includes materials synthesis, performance characterization, and in-package evaluation.  In parallel, the project will examine methods for storage, shipment, and dispensing to ensure a product that is ready for integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor assembly and testing industry by the end of this project.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in potentially reducing the detrimental impacts of weather and climate on the United States energy and insurance markets. To help the American economy prepare further in advance for impactful weather and climate events, this project will develop a forecast system that can translate climate forecasts into likelihoods of impactful weather events. This information will be used to inform the energy and insurance markets of financial risk, particularly within the renewable energy sector where weather and climate control the amount of energy produced. Renewable energy is produced locally within the United States, which means this project will improve the nation?s energy security by informing when and where renewable energy will be most available. Conservative estimates of the technology?s potential include a $2.5 million per year benefit to the renewable energy industry, with a similar multi-million dollar impact to the more general parametric insurance market.

    This project will enhance a climate forecast system developed during the company's NSF SBIR Phase I award that issues climate forecasts up to a decade into the future. The enhancements include increased forecast accuracy through automated machine learning model parameter tuning, forecast post-processing, and the translation of the climate forecasts into realistic weather patterns. The technology uses machine learning to identify patterns in the land, atmosphere, and ocean that help determine how the climate system will evolve on timescales of one month to one decade. These climate forecasts will then be translated into realistic possibilities of future weather patterns on daily timescales. These daily weather patterns can then be used to inform renewable energy power production forecasts and extreme weather event risk for numerous industries, including the energy sector and the general insurance industry. A key technical benefit to the proposed forecast system is its high computational scalability, which enables the rapid creation of climate forecasts that are typically produced using supercomputers.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Resesarch (SBIR) Phase II project will be in helping to close the homework gap in the United States. The homework gap has been a long simmering problem where 12 ? 17 million K-12 students do not have reliable home internet to complete digital homework. Students that could benefit the most from learning applications that require home access are disproportionately from lower-income, rural, and at-risk minority populations. While new broadband funding initiatives may make incremental improvements to the situation, millions of students in low-income and rural areas continue to be left behind. This project aims to use new advances in web technologies and intelligent agents to provide a software solution that will enable any student to participate in a complete digital homework workflow including interactive lessons, videos, and robust teacher feedback even when they have unreliable or no access to the internet. Unconnected adult learners will also benefit from the project as technical skills training including computer programming will be supported.  This solution will assist in filling the key technical skill gaps in the American workforce.


    This SBIR Phase II project will advance a new homework management system that will support digital learning with a consistent experience for learners that are online, offline, or in degraded network conditions and on any available devices. Through an innovative offline-first distributed architecture that solves complex problems around state divergence and conflict resolution, user identity, system integrations and offline content management, this system attempts to bring equitable access to learners who have historically had limited or no access to at-home digital homework solutions. The system will utilize intelligence at the edge to facilitate effective, research-based, pedagogical approaches to improve learning outcomes and minimize teacher overhead. Pilot programs and user feedback studies, along with custom-built learning model simulators will be used to evaluate and iteratively refine the system's efficacy. The goal of this project's research and development will be the release of a production-ready, scalable homework management system that makes positive progress toward bridging the homework gap.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase the volume and improve the accuracy of data on the world?s forests. Presently, when collecting data on forests, surveyors must choose between slow, laborious methods, or quick but inaccurate ones. This project uses recent advances in sensors and machine learning to greatly improve data collection speed without sacrificing accuracy. The resulting rich datasets enable the construction of true ?digital twins? of forests and open the door for higher fidelity modeling of forest growth trajectories. This information is useful both for timber firms seeking to maximize the potential of their assets and environmental groups projecting how changes today could impact a forest?s performance as a carbon-sink over the long term. The impacts on United States citizens are widespread. Here are two examples: improved efficiency in the timber industry brings down the cost and improves the quality of raw materials and turning forests into denser carbon sinks helps meet climate change goals. The availability of such broad and deep data on forests could also drive a boom in research and understanding about the more complex and nuanced relationships that drive forest health and productivity, launching entirely new sub-industries around forestry.

    The key technological innovations explored in this STTR Phase I project are in constructing the most high-fidelity forest model (digital twin) by combining disparate information sources, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors on backpacks provide high-quality inventory metrics nearly 1000 times faster than manual measurements, but still require someone in the forest to wear the backpack. Satellite imagery scales almost instantly to entire forests and also through time with historical data but is limited by the top-down nature of satellites and the resolution they offer, especially when historical and free data sources are considered. Drone-based imagery sits in-between, with advantages and disadvantages of both. In practice, combining information sources that measure in such different ways can be very difficult. In this project, the team explores how to express LiDAR-based metrics to best associate them with top-down imagery from satellites and drones. From these associations, one can then build powerful machine learning models and specialize them to individual forests. This ability may enable the company to provide forest inventories and forest management recommendations to timber companies at any scale: with satellite imagery only or with a combination of backpack-LiDAR and satellite for the highest accuracy over the entire forest.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ensure the secure transfer of goods and/or passengers in commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and prevent the likelihood of secondary incidents when a commercial motor vehicles (CMV) has made an emergency stop on a highway. All CMVs need to comply with traffic safety regulations and deploy emergency warning devices (e.g., safety triangles) during an emergency stop. Without the presence of a human driver, an automated CMV should also be able to automate emergency warning device placement. Proper placement of these warning devices can be life-saving for drivers of non-automated vehicles on a highway. The proposed project will increase the safety of external drivers by preventing any secondary incidents associated with the lane/shoulder blockage due to a CMV malfunction and protect drivers of non-automated and/or semi-automated vehicles by assisting in the deployment of emergency warning triangles on highways. This project aims to remove barriers to higher-order automated technology adoption due to lack of standardization.

    The project will result in the design, research, and development of an affordable, after-market, reliable, and safe autonomous Warning Triangle System (aWTS) to ensure the safety of the automated and semi-automated commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) during an emergency stop without requiring human assistance. aWTS consists of three low-cost autonomous triangle reflector devices which are planned to optimally fit in a charging dock/enclosure where they will be safely stored during stand-by mode. When activated by the emergency signal transmitted from the CMV, the autonomous triangles are designed to move successively to their pre-determined destinations on the highway. The research and development activity during this Phase I project includes, but is not limited to: reviewing safety codes and regulations, investigating different highway scenarios and associated challenges, and performing computer simulations; developing proof-of-concept hardware that can demonstrate the proposed system?s technical feasibility and its integration to automated CMVs; determining the optimal placement and assembly of the autonomous reflective triangles by collaborating with auto manufacturers; investigating the potential cyber-security risks to develop secure communications between CMV and aWTS; and identifying the operational challenges and the design targets while considering the cost of deployment, lifecycle costs, functional use, and interoperability.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is enabling enhanced prediction of severe weather formation to a timing resolution of hours instead of days. Improved weather predictions have a significant impact on people?s lives, allowing for better planning, proactive evacuations, and reducing deaths, injuries and property damage, especially in vulnerable populations. With climatologists predicting dramatic increases in damaging and dangerous severe weather over the next decades, accurate prediction of severe weather is even more critical. This project will launch a robotics-as-a-service business around the technology which can rapidly reach sustainability, generating economic impacts while providing significant environmental, scientific, and societal benefits. As the technology matures and becomes more widespread, entirely novel analysis and predictive models will be developed around the data being produced, unlocking even higher value economic insights for insurance, energy, financial, and transportation industries.


    The part of the atmosphere from the ground up to about 3,000 feet is called the atmospheric boundary layer. This area is difficult to monitor but has a huge impact on gas, heat, and energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. This project enables better monitoring and understanding of this area, unlocking scientific, logistical, and policy advancements that will drive new innovations in climate, environmental, and weather science with high impact on humanity. The proposed technology enables gathering high spatial and temporal resolution atmospheric data with a swarm of synchronized sampling aircrafts. The swarm system will use lightweight design approaches and proprietary optimization techniques for portability, swarm capability, flight endurance, and low cost. Using automation and robotics, including remote operational support, this project will enable data that can potentially be deployed globally to be gathered in a scalable and low-cost manner.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a disruption to the growing communications marketplace (> $4.7B market by 2026) which is limited by the capabilities of semiconductor manufacturing processes and the cost of compound semiconductors such as gallium nitride (GaN). This project will reimagine the semiconductor manufacturing process by bringing compound and silicon-based semiconductors together to reduce system costs relative to solutions using only single device technologies. This project will assemble future systems for the burgeoning communications and sensing industries in a proprietary technology platform to support a shift in manufacturing technology that spans from lithographic patterning to the assembly of the smallest constituent parts. Finally, the project will enable low-cost, automated semiconductor manufacturing to help the United States regain leadership in silicon semiconductor manufacturing while helping US-based semiconductor foundries define new markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a first-of-its-kind analysis of failure mechanisms in heterogeneous semiconductors and the design of unique mixed-signal circuitry that improves the yield and reliability in integrated circuits. Heterogeneous integration of semiconductors with different fundamental material properties has been an emerging goal for ?beyond Moore?s law? semiconductors. Radio frequency (RF) and millimeter-wave integrated circuits will benefit in performance by circumventing fundamental limitations with all silicon approaches.  The project will develop new approaches from materials to systems around an optimization of devices to meet performance objectives such as output power, linearity, and noise while leveraging the intimate integration with mixed-signal approaches based in silicon to provide calibration, compensation, and predistortion of RF imperfections. While low levels of heterogeneous integration have been demonstrated in millimeter-wave bands, the integrated circuit technology  will require dozens and even hundreds of III-V devices integrated on a common platform with millions of silicon transistors. The proposed effort will assess the failure mechanisms associated with the assembly and operation of new integrated circuits and approaches to mitigate these problems to reduce the cost of bringing next generation products to market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project is to provide an in-farm sensing system that will notify sow (adult female swine) farmers of early signs of animal lameness, and thereby reduce early sow mortality and enhance farm productivity. The technology uses artificial intelligence to analyze pig locomotion in order to spot subtle patterns indicative of lameness. Early detection of lameness will enable farmers to take corrective actions rather than waiting for lameness to deteriorate to sow death or culling.  Early culling or sow death is a major economic cost to farmers and a large fraction of death and culls is due to animal lameness.  Successful application of the technology being developed in this project promises to reduce early sow mortality and culling, leading to additional litters per sow and so provide a significant economic boost to farmers.  With patent applications for key components of the sensing system, farmers will install sensors in hallways and obtain health measures for each sow when she moves between rooms. The projected annual revenue is $3.0 million.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes combining an imaging sensor with artificial intelligence to create a unique sensing system to unobtrusively and remotely diagnose lameness in sows (adult female swine) as they traverse hallways.  This project seeks to validate two key technical contributions. First, precise 3D animal posture and locomotion are estimated for sows moving beneath a ceiling-mounted sensor.  High accuracy is achieved through a novel annotation technique that overcomes difficulties in inaccurate manual location of skeletal landmarks.  Second, a data-driven approach is used to train a deep neural network to learn the most discriminating combinations of posture and gait for determining lameness in walking sows.  A self-supervised neural network sidesteps the need for extensive manual annotation and expert annotation is only required for lameness assessment.  Together, these two contributions will enable a transformative technical capability of a remote sensor that can automatically diagnose early-stage lameness in sows.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of instant, remote medical tests for telehealth. This project could develop an accurate machine learning-based predictive model for strep throat. The business model delivers an artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support system as a Software as a Service subscription to urgent care telehealth services. The total addressable market for all telehealth point of care tests (beyond strep throat) in urgent care and primary care is $10.4 billion. This solution impacts antibiotic overprescribing and economics of health services. Currently, 34% of children and 75% of adults with pharyngitis receive unnecessary antibiotics, and this is 10-21% worse with telehealth. A remote point of care prediction for strep throat can potentially reduce the $22 million/year costs in unnecessary antibiotics and reduce drivers for drug-resistant bacteria. When pharyngitis is treated on telehealth it saves patients up to 1-3 hours per clinical visit and saves health insurance companies up to $100-400 per visit, compared to an emergency room or urgent care facility.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the field of machine learning by combining smartphone image analysis and deep learning. These strategies are applied to a novel use case in digital health as remote screening for clinical decision support. The technical challenge is the development of a predictive model to achieve sensitivity and specificity acceptable for clinical adoption, at a target of > 80% (similar to the rapid antigen strep test). The strategy to meet this challenge is to increase the size of the dataset and experiment with multiple prediction models until goal performance is achieved. The project will also include designing an authentication system that validates sufficient images as recorded by an untrained patient and creating an intuitive user interface that enables consistent recordings by patients.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a decrease in the devastating effects of deep implant-related infections.  The technology could result in advances to the clinical health and welfare of the American public by improving clinical outcomes and decreasing morbidity and mortality. The technology addressed by this project may protect surgical implants, such as joint replacements and spinal fusion systems from bacterial colonization and developing infections. This technology could significantly reduce the greater than $3 billion cost to the US healthcare system from implant related infections. This antimicrobial technology could be used beyond medical applications for such things as food packaging to decrease foodborne diseases and more than double shelf-life of certain food products. Additionally, the linker technology developed through this project may be used to create super slick or self-cleaning surfaces with applications in the aerospace and marine industries resulting in increased fuel efficiency and performance.

    The project aims to develop a homogeneous, covalently bound, linker molecule attached to medical implant material (titanium alloy) upon which a quaternary ammonium-modified oligosaccharide will be subsequently attached. Oligosaccharides are known to be biocompatible and quaternized oligosaccharides are highly potent antimicrobials. A treated medical implant could possess a powerfully antimicrobial surface so that, during surgery, any bacteria that encounter the surface will be killed. In this way, it is hoped that the avascular surface of the implant will not serve as a site for biofilm formation and growth and thus, reduce the incidence of perioperative infections. The key to any successful surface modification is the quality of the chemical attachment of linkers and active molecules to that surface. Polyphenols and catechols such as dopamine are ideal candidates for investigation as these molecules are generally known for their facility in forming thin films onto a wide variety of surfaces. Using dopamine as a model system, catechol analogs will be electrochemically attached, and the resulting thin films analyzed for attachment, thickness, ease of further modification, and morphology. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV/Visible spectroscopy, soak/stress protocols and microbiology will be used to gauge the success or failure of a thin film plus oligosaccharide combination.

    \ content in individual cells is based on infrared (IR)-absorption spectroscopy\
    \ which is label-free, quantitative, and non-destructive.  Synthetic biology is\
    \ poised to disrupt the chemical value-chain by providing an alternative to petroleum-based\
    \ chemicals that is sustainable and carbon-neutral.  Once a highly productive\
    \ cell is identified it can be selectively propagated to create enriched cell\
    \ lines. Innovations in optical microscopy are required to improve the performance\
    \ of the cell screening instruments, which will allow high-resolution focusing\
    \ across a broad spectral range. The upgraded platform will optimize yield more\

    \ cell strains. \n\nThe proposed project emphasizes optical engineering to develop\
    \ a microscope designed for high-resolution chemical imaging based on molecular\
    \ vibrational IR-absorptions. This is achieved by deploying focusing elements\
    \ that operate over a broad spectral range that extend standard optical microscopes\
    \ to include mid-infrared light sources. The optical instrument will be used to\
    \ evaluate chemical content in industrial microbe strains and develop enriched\
    \ cell lines. These single-cell microbe populations are engineered to produce\
    \ enzymes used to catalyze the synthesis of valuable metabolites. Yields from\
    \ individual cells, however, are variable due to genetic mutations in the population.\
    \ Therefore, a quantitative analytical tool based on IR-spectroscopy that can\
    \ non-destructively identify highly productive cells for selective propagation\
    \ is extremely desirable. This bottom-up approach for metabolomic cell screening\
    \ and directed evolution is an innovation as it is label-free, non-invasive, and\
    \ has strong chemical specificity. In this project, the team will study an industrial\
    \ microalgae strain used as a low-cost feedstock supplement and identify cells\
    \ rich in protein content to enhance the overall protein yield.\n\nThis award\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reimagine bio-manufacturing with a novel platform technology that could boost the yields of many products, including food additives, biomaterials precursors, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. The technological advancement addresses a fundamental issue that limits conventional bio-fermentation, which is that producing cells suffer limited health and viability in exchange for higher yields. In this proposal, genetic tools will be used to divide the labor of cell reproduction and product synthesis into two different cell types, called stem cells and factory cells. As older factory cells become exhausted, productivity is maintained by new factory cells, which are born from the stem cell population. The approach may be particularly well suited to biofuels and other molecules that are difficult to produce in large quantities by conventional bio-fermentation because the product is toxic to the cells that make it. It could be applied toward increasing the profitability of existing bio-processes and also for bringing new products to market, which are currently too difficult to produce. In this project, the team seeks to demonstrate the benefits of producing a fuel (limonene) and a dairy enzyme (chymosin), as proof of its application in biofuel and agricultural sectors. Broad industrial implementation will advance bio-manufacturing toward the ?green? revolution, contributing to the development of cleaner industries and decreasing US and global reliance on fossil fuels.

    This project aims to solve two major limitations of microbial fermentation processes: metabolic exhaustion and genetic drift. These are nearly universal problems in the industry. Highly producing cells can become inactive due to the lack of metabolic resources, cytotoxic effects of products, and mutations that break the biosynthetic pathway. In this project, Microbial Stem Cell Technology (MiST) uncouples growth and production by establishing a multicellular system. One cell type is dedicated to product synthesis (factory cells), while another (stem cells) is responsible for cell division and the generation of new factory cells. As older factory cells lose productivity, the bioreactor is continuously replenished with new factory cells, derived from the stem cell population. By maintaining an active factory cell population, MiST-supported cultures are expected to exhibit increased production longevity and higher overall yield than conventional bio-fermentations. This project aims to validate the technology in E. coli engineered to produce limonene, a precursor for biodiesel and other useful chemicals. In the factory cells, T7RNAP will drive high-level expression of a suite of biosynthetic enzymes. Since limonene has a cytotoxic effect on producing cells, MiST-supported factory cell replenishment is expected to increase productivity by more than 2-fold compared to the conventional limonene-producing strains.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the human gut microbiome, the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract.  The gut microbiome influences a variety of human diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, these diseases afflict more than 120 million people and cost more than $580 billion in patient treatments in the US annually. The current standard care of treatments for many of these diseases have variable efficacy and serious side effects. There is increasing interest in modulating the gut microbiome using microbiome therapeutics, i.e., therapeutics comprising living bacteria, as a new generation of drugs for difficult-to-treat diseases. However, the industry currently lacks a reliable approach to systematically and cost-effectively developing effective microbiome therapeutics. Specifically, the largest barrier to microbiome therapeutic development is the lack of predictive preclinical models to translate early-stage research into drug discovery and development.

    The proposed project seeks to address the barrier to the use of microbiome therapeutics by developing a first-of-its-kind computational platform, as the first comprehensive, computational, drug design and discovery platform. Currently, the development of microbiome therapeutics is based on a series of experimental and statistical steps that identify the potential microbial strains for target therapeutic candidates in an empirical and iterative process. As a result, this approach requires extensive iterative in vitro and in vivo experiments, which substantially increase the length and cost of the development programs. These challenges have resulted in an inefficient and unpredictable microbiome therapeutic development process, limiting the number of efficacious microbiome therapeutics that could save millions of lives worldwide. This project addresses these challenges by reliably and cost-effectively identifying therapeutic candidates for a wide range of indications. This platform could replace the current iterative and unpredictable development process in the drug discovery stage. The utility of the platform will be demonstrated by developing new therapeutic candidates for Type 2 Diabetes and validating the efficacy of these candidates in preclinical studies.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable experts in the biomedical field to improve understanding of how new therapeutic approaches are developed and perform in the context of a complex immune system. This technology could enable new therapies to translate to patients faster, at less expense, and with higher rates of success. These therapeutics, such as antibodies, cell and gene therapies, and vaccines, can deliver excellent results when they work, but available therapies do not work for all patients. To develop and deliver the next generation of therapies to improve the lives of patients, investigators need to be able to understand how immune cells and other cells move, interact, kill, and survive over time. This project allows researchers, developers, and manufacturing experts to understand the functional performance of new therapies earlier, more completely, and at lower expense. Such single-cell analysis is a multi-billion market among commercial and non-profit markets.

    The proposed project will develop and rigorously validate a novel array consumable that enables scaling dynamic, single-cell analysis from an early access laboratory to any facility worldwide. Initial design and testing activities for the next generation arrays using non-scalable proof of concept production methodologies have demonstrated the value of the dynamic single-cell functional analysis platform. This project will develop and evaluate two options for producing the arrays, one with an embossing technique and one with a three-dimensional printing technique. Successful completion of this project will support scaling the only platform that can evaluate migration, contact dynamics, killing, survival, subcellular activity, and biomolecule secretion for the same individual cell over time and in high throughput to improve development and delivery of novel therapies faster, with higher rates of success, and at lower expense.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the ability to quickly and inexpensively determine the presence and genetic sequence of a wide variety of pathogenic organisms. Most importantly, this technology could be implemented without prior assumptions as to which organisms are expected. Sequencing will be accomplished by direct electrical identification of the building blocks, the bases, of the genomic sequence. The potential societal impact of this technology is to provide a method to screen individuals quickly (under a minute) for the presence of infections. Screening at ports of entry and in appropriate community settings will minimize disease transmission and allow for the quick identification and treatment of any infected individuals at US borders. In addition, beyond this immediate application, the technology may also enhance scientific understanding of normal genetic sequences in any organism. If its anticipated speed, high accuracy, and low cost are realized, this technology may find applications in human in vitro diagnostics and human genome sequencing. The studies in this Phase I project will lead to a proof-of-concept demonstration for an automated, commercial instrument.

    The project seeks to determine the identity and order of the genetic building blocks, the nucleotide bases, comprising any genomic sequences present in a sample solution. This sequencing will be done by examining the ability of each base in the sequence to modify a tunneling current as it is passed by electrophoresis across two very closely spaced tunneling electrodes. Tunneling is a well-known quantum mechanical effect, and it is quite sensitive to the electrical configuration of the object (here a given specific nucleotide base) present between its electrodes. Experiments with this technology to date have been unsuccessful because genetic sequences have not been able to be moved slowly enough across the tunneling electrodes for their bases to be distinguished. The studies here will overcome this problem by modifications of the geometry and solution conditions of the electrophoresis and possibly with improved methods of tunneling current detection. The data obtained through the application of this technology is expected to enhance the current understanding of nucleotide base chemistry. The solution may permit the detection of nucleotide base modifications of potential biological and medical importance.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the electric motor market and provide the competitive advantage to the US in mobile robotic applications. Electromagnetic flaws in brushless direct current (DC) motors and sensorless controllers have severely limited the performance of mobile robots and stymied the potential growth of the industry. High performance servo motors and motor controllers do exist, but they are too heavy, large, and expensive to be incorporated into many robotic applications, particularly mobile robots. By combining a unique hardware design with a software solution to eliminate intrinsic hardware problems, this project will result in an ultra-compact, high performance, and low-cost electric servomotor.  The drone industry is expected to be the first to benefit from the proposed solution, as many commercial and defense drone companies are in need of industrial-grade propulsion components. A superior propulsion solution will accelerate the mass adoption of drones and other mobile robots.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to create the next generation of drone propulsion technology: an innovative drone motor and controller. Currently, drone companies are forced to use hobby-grade, sensorless motors and controllers, which suffer from poor performance and reliability issues. The Phase II project is rooted in the results obtained during Phase I activities, which led to the development of a calibration suite and a novel motor design. Phase I laid the foundation for creating an ultra-compact, high-performance motor and controller solution that is ideal for drone propulsion. The novel hardware design minimizes mass and production costs and, when combined with the calibration suite and angle compensation algorithm, the solution offers a substantial enhancement in propulsion efficiency, controllability, and reliability. The team will test its product with industrial drone manufacturers to verify its ability to increase vehicle flight time, enhance maneuverability, and minimize critical vehicle failures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the advancement of an innovative therapy for Short Bowel Syndrome. Compared to current non-curative treatments that are chronic and associated with dangerous complications, rehospitalization, and high mortality, the proposed solution has the potential to substantially improve outcomes and quality-of-life for patients and their families. The potential commercial impact of this project is likewise substantial. Treating short bowel syndrome currently costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient per year. adds more than $5 billion to US healthcare expenditures annually. Thus, the proposed curative solution can lead to enormous savings in dollars and in specialists? time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a curative therapy for patients with Short Bowel Syndrome, which is currently managed with intravenous nutrition and lacks effective treatments. The proposed solution will lengthen the intestine, increasing the absorptive surface area and restoring the natural function of the gut, enabling patients to get sufficient nutrition from the food they eat. The proposed system comprises nondestructive tissue anchors and a spring that pushes against them to stretch the intestine and force it to grow. Having previously developed the tissue anchors, this project develops a delivery method that will allow the system to be implanted in the intestine through a minimally invasive procedure. Feedback will be gathered from pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons about the delivery method, and device performance will be measured in pre-clinical large-animal studies. Successful completion of the proposed project will demonstrate intestinal lengthening in vivo, achieved via a minimally invasive procedure, and establish a foundation for planning subsequent preclinical testing that will be required for regulatory approval to commercialize the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project focuses on improving the management of chronic disease by enabling team-based primary care is key to achieving clinical results and taking advantage of new ?value based" payment reforms. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, six out of ten adults have a chronic disease and 90% of the national annual healthcare expenditures are spend on people with these conditions.  Our technology proposes to apply precision-education instructional theory to enhance primary care team competencies and promote situational awareness, enhanced communication, defined role clarity, improved coordination and leadership support to improve patient outcomes which is directly aligned to the National Science Foundation?s mission of promoting science to advance the nation?s health.  This project is being designed for commercial use in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which serve one in twelve people in the United States.  There are 1,373 FQHCs in the US serving 27 million patients annually in medically underserved areas. Public and private payment models are rapidly moving toward incentives/bonuses for team-based care and demonstrated outcome improvements. Improvements in the cost and outcomes of care for this patients with chronic disease will have enormous social and economic benefit for the Nation.

    This SBIR Phase II project uses machine learning to integrate individual-level clinical and social characteristics into suggested treatment paths and to apply precision training techniques that improve the skills of individual members of the care team. Our objectives focus on validating the feasibility of machine learning to provide health professionals with recommended workflows and continued education based on trends and gaps in care identified from patient data. The method includes a computational engine to guide reinforcement learning. Machine learning has made possible the development of statistical models to establish effect sizes of clinical interventions, enabling personalized instruction and support to health team members based on patient outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the ability to enable a safer, more reliable, and more resilient electric power system. A reliable and efficient grid is the cornerstone of the nation?s economy. With the rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), a transition from conventional generation plants to utility-scale wind and solar farms, and the threat of cyber- and/or physical attacks on the bulk electric system, ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid has become ever more challenging. The software being developed in this project will help grid planning engineers and operators cope with these modern challenges. For the first time, engineers from organizations across the utility industry will be able to collaboratively plan the grid on a secure, scalable, cloud-based software platform that provides the capabilities needed to fully assess the impact of renewables and DERs. The software?s industry-leading simulation robustness will allow users to analyze extreme contingencies, cascading events, and weak grid scenarios to develop preventive and corrective actions that secure the grid. The software is designed to support an annual $50B+ in US power infrastructure investment and an annual $400B+ in power market transactions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software for electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) planning.  Technical tasks are to: 1) Make cloud architecture responsive to demand with autoscaling and queueing services; 2) Architect results generation for minimized data storage requirements; 3) Manage data handling for reduced re-loading of datasets; 4) Implement a file parser for industry-standard three-phase unbalanced distribution system models; 5) Implement models of common distribution system components; and 6) Extend the cloud platform to support integrated T&D analysis.  Integration of these optimized components will lead to an improved system engineered for usage at scale.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project proposes continued development of a directional microwave ablation (MWA) system. During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicator?s tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.

    As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance the development of a self-cleaning window glass coating with the same appearance as bare glass. The improved performance and decreased cost will enable its use in applications beyond residential and commercial windows, such as outdoor displays and solar modules, dramatically increasing the potential overall market opportunity.  More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve many properties of surfaces used in wide-ranging applications from computer chips to clothing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a high-performance photocatalytic self-cleaning coating on glass. Present photocatalytic coatings typically utilize dense titanium dioxide, that increases the reflectance of the glass because of its high refractive index.  Initial work has demonstrated coatings of controllable refractive index deposited with a new coating technology, Aerosol Impact-Driven Assembly (AIDA).  This project will scale a multilayered, multicomponent coating that addresses the photocatalytic activity/transmittance trade-off. The coating will have industry-leading photocatalytic activity and transmittance higher than the current state-of-the-art at lower costs. More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve the optical, thermal, electronic, chemical, and adhesive properties of surfaces for many applications.  Research objectives include optimization of the durability and outdoor performance of this coating by refining the deposition hardware and the coating structure, demonstration of the scalability of the AIDA process by depositing coatings on larger substrates, and quantification of the performance metrics required for infusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make on-site hydrogen generation convenient and economically viable. Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure.  One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer.  The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype.  The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity.  The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in the negative effects of laparoscopies, procedures to enter the abdomen through a small incision.  Over 15 million laparoscopies are performed worldwide each year, particularly gynecologists, who represent roughly half the surgeons performing these procedures in the U.S. The proposed procedure does not require surgeons to alter their surgical techniques and requires minimal training. It uses equipment already in the hospital. The benefits will include better surgical outcomes, decreased patient post-op pain, and increased surgeon and patient satisfaction.  Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp and less invasively than perforating towel clips.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting parameters. Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually.  However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand access to quality health care for underserved populations.  The proposed project develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant, women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example. The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips. Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules, such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the paper lateral flow strips.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to improve education and experiential learning.  The proposed tool will support both synchronous and asynchronous learning while providing students with the opportunity to engage independently and connect their learning to internships, job shadows, service projects, and other real-world learning experiences. This project will enhance teacher capacity to guide and assess student learning, increase transparency and objectivity in assessment, and expand the learning ecosystem of schools by empowering students to engage in and validate authentic, real-world learning experience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel competency-based evaluation tool and learner recommendation engine designed to: assess a range of currently needed skills and competencies, aggregate assessment data for the purpose of generating a comprehensive learner record in real time, and generate personalized competency pathways and recommendations for learning and growth. The key intellectual merits of this proposal are the formulas used to aggregate assessment data over time and the algorithms used to generate personalized competency pathways and learner recommendations. The technical challenges are the development and testing of the associated algorithms to guide and evaluate learning in both academic and authentic, real-world contexts. Research conducted during this Phase I project enable testing and refining of the data aggregation formulas utilized by the assessment tool, as well as optimization of the learner recommendation algorithms used for the creation of personalized competency pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to address the strong clinical need for a single injection/dose sparing delivery system that can safely release therapeutics in the joint space over time in a controllable dosing manner for sustained symptomatic relief. Early and efficient treatments that mitigate inflammation are becoming increasingly critical to ease the care and cost burdens associated with musculoskeletal conditions, which impact 1.71 billion people globally. The proposed platform, which can be applied to a wide variety of drugs, including small molecules, proteins, and biologics will address the market need for improved drug delivery systems by providing a tunable drug delivery system that is responsive to different degrees of mechanical force created by different movement types.  The solution will allow for more precise delivery of drugs when and where they are needed. This feature will translate to fewer injections, fewer systemic side effects, and overall improved drug efficacy compared to current offerings, in turn providing improved patient quality of life and outcomes. The proposed mechano-activated drug delivery platform is expected to have a major impact in controlling musculoskeletal diseases by improving efficacy of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments and enabling new therapeutic strategies.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a force-stimulated drug delivery system that uses the body?s natural physiological loading of musculoskeletal environments for controlled release of nearly any drug. The technology is based on the tunable rupture profile of proprietary mechano-activated microcapsules - translating to fewer injections, fewer systemic side effects, and overall improved drug efficacy. Preliminary work has demonstrated the ability of the microcapsules to encapsulate and release viable biological therapeutics upon mechanical force, to provide tunable mechano-activation thresholds, and to stay and rupture within a living joint. For this Phase I project, a proof-of-concept study will be conducted to establish the feasibility of the mechano-activated microcapsule drug delivery platform in a biological joint environment. This study will be accomplished by evaluating the anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a drug with established ability to inhibit acute joint inflammation, delivered via mechano-activated microcapsules in an established equine model of Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta)-induced acute joint inflammation, in comparison to soluble formulations. This study will provide a basis for investigation into more specific disease applications, models, and terminal outcomes where modification of the disease process over the long term can be evaluated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from extracting meaningful, useful, specific information from ?dark data.? Dark data are the countless documents companies produce and receive, which contain unused information ? usually because they are in formats that computers do not understand. Many of these documents do not even contain accessible text: only pictures of text. Word-processing documents and emails do have text, but no information about what the text is. Computers can easily tell that ?10/05/2022? is a date, but knowing it is the date a particular agreement starts or ends (or something else) is needed to make it useful. This project uses a range of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that work in real time while people are writing new documents or extracting data from old documents. The AI learns quickly from examples, finds patterns across similar documents, and uses that learning to save the user from having to search for items again and again in varying contexts. This saves a lot of tedious work and reduces errors. The extracted information helps companies understand, analyze, and make business decisions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project identifies and extracts useful information items from long natural language documents, especially contracts and agreements. The technology identifies items much more specifically than typical extraction methods; for example, not only as person, organization, or place names, but as to what role each plays. Likewise, addresses, dates, money amounts, and other data items only become useful when you know what they?re for. This is a valuable focus for advancing Natural Language Understanding. The team combine and extend Machine Learning technologies such as few-shot learning, fine-tuning, and semantic parsing to achieve these stronger, more ?semantic? results. This solution allows companies to generate value from huge troves of information they already collect but cannot yet automate or leverage.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from addressing the gap between the ride hail and vehicle rental markets via the creation of a new, more accessible ?car hailing? mode of transportation. Based on technical advancements in vehicle safety and fleet logistics, car hailing technology offers the potential for direct and desirable social impacts, including: more equitable transportation that can improve quality of life and decrease cost of living; less personal vehicle ownership and less pollution as a result of more efficient vehicle fleet utilization; centralized, managed parking, which could free land for pedestrians, housing, and businesses precisely where it is needed most; and significant job creation due to the need for remote human vehicle operators. These societal and environmental benefits also directly translate into increased economic competitiveness of the United States: more equitable and available transportation for workers enables businesses to compete more successfully in the global markets, and improved quality of life and wage opportunities leads to more productive workers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help enable scalable commercial deployment of vehicle teleoperation technology and services by further developing and improving previous advances in robotics control, perception, and safety engineering. There are two primary objectives for the Phase II research. The first is to develop new techniques and methodologies in safety engineering that will enable the systematic testing and safety assurances necessary for large-scale public road deployments of vehicle teleoperation technology. The second is to revise and improve the novel control and perception technologies developed during the Phase I project to satisfy new requirements derived from the company?s safety engineering advances. The results of the Phase II research will include robotics control and perception capabilities that significantly advance the state of the art, as well as a new set of safety engineering practices and methodologies that could serve as a foundation for the emerging industry of vehicle teleoperation and autonomous vehicle safety.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable automated and autonomous charging of a wide array of electric vehicles (e.g., electrified robots, cars and trucks, and drones) in adverse weather conditions.  Examples include autonomous systems used in farming and logistics, electric vehicles in ports, and electric trucks. Despite tremendous progress and the proliferation of electric vehicles, an adequate, cost-effective, autonomous, and available charging infrastructure is currently lacking. This gap between need and availability is far worse in high power applications such as trucking. The proposed technology increases the deployment of autonomous mobile robots and drones in industries like agriculture and logistics which are currently suffering from labor issues.  The technology may increase the deployment rate of commercial electric vehicle fleets that can contribute to reducing greenhouse gasses.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to solve a key problem in the automation of the charging process for electric vehicles, namely precision localization and docking in adverse weather conditions. The conventional methods of localization for docking (e.g., infrared or vision-based) have limitations such as insufficient precision and limited performance in less-than-optimal environmental conditions. This team presents a high precision automated docking solution in the presence of clutter and removes objects that are potentially harming the Line of Sight (LOS). The goals of the proposed research and development are: 1) establishing that time averaged, multi-path signal characteristics in multiple spectral bands can identify locations within a known map or during a close proximity approach of the electric vehicle to the charger; 2) developing models suitable for Monte-Carlo modeling and simulation of an indoor environment or region in proximity of a charger benchmarked by some measurements and using such simulations for verification success; and 3) developing a high precision transponder based on wideband signaling.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of manufacturing technologies\
    \ for industries such as telecommunications, data communications, sensors. and\
    \ defense. Most of the internet relies on data centers to process data, and this\
    \ processing is accomplished via a device called an optical transceiver. These\
    \ transceivers house an optical fiber, which is as thin as a single strand of\
    \ human hair, attached to a chip device to transfer information to/from the data\
    \ centers. The optical fiber is so small that it is very difficult to precisely\
    \ connect the fiber to the chip, often resulting in performance losses. With >100,000\
    \ transceivers per data center and >2,700 data centers in the United States, it\
    \ is important to have good fiber connection for reduced power consumption and\
    \ increased performance. Technology companies are also looking for chips with\
    \ multiple fibers, making the need for better fiber placement even greater. In\
    \ this project, the company focuses a new technology that makes fiber placement\
    \ on a chip faster, more accurate, and cheaper. This new technology uses a special\
    \ component that enables fiber placement with precision while improving the device\

    \ product consists of a fusion splicing machine and a novel silicon dioxide mode\
    \ converter. The mode converter localizes heat from the laser, enabling fusion\
    \ while simultaneously decreasing the loss level. This technology packages silicon\
    \ photonic devices without compromising performance. It significantly improves\
    \ packaging speed from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, increases power efficiency by\
    \ 4X, and provides a 50% savings. The company has demonstrated coupling losses\
    \ lower than the industry standard of 3 dB on specialty chips. The research objectives\
    \ involve improving coupling losses to around 1 dB, demonstrating splicing with\
    \ foundry chips, and improving the strength of the fusion splice for improved\
    \ reliability. The completion of these objectives will result in extremely low\
    \ loss photonic packaging applicable for use with foundry chips, increasing the\
    \ commercialization potential of the technology. This technology will enable customers\
    \ to package single or multi-fiber devices with high efficiency, low cost, and\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of origami design principles in industry to create manufacturing efficiencies and promote technological innovation.  Origami-inspired engineering has applications across virtually all Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, yet existing computer-aided design (CAD) tools are extremely limited in their ability to model folded geometries. This Phase I project and subsequent commercialization effort will fill a gap in the market by creating powerful and user-friendly software to model folding, with target customers spanning a broad range of industries: product design, architecture, packaging, papercraft, education, manufacturing, and materials engineering. Academic publications resulting from the research and development conducted during this project will advance fundamental knowledge of the mathematics of folding. Furthermore, this work seeks to create positive educational impacts through ongoing collaborations with K-12 STEM educators to create engaging curricula in geometry, digital design, and manufacturing through papercraft.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create an intelligent software system that facilitates the design and simulation of folded geometries via powerful origami editing techniques grounded in fundamental research. The Phase I research and development builds on the team?s prior work on origami design algorithms and efficient origami simulation methods to establish a novel design framework that supports intuitive editing of folded geometry by novice users. A particular focus of the project is the under-explored domain of curved crease origami, which promises new opportunities for high-performance materials engineering and expressive design.  Phase I research studies will investigate key open research problems underpinning the CAD system; this work will establish efficient methods and mathematical bounds for critical origami design algorithms to be implemented by the software system. Primary technical hurdles of the Phase I project include: architecting a novel constraint management system to support interactive editing of origami designs, establishing novel computational design algorithms for curved crease origami, and developing core data structures and geometry processing methods to be used by the CAD system. Throughout Phase I, the team will work with customers and strategic partners to identify specific use cases of folding in key vertical markets, develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) software application, and evaluate technical progress in terms of its commercial potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop further a predictive model for health providers to address the life-threatening condition of preeclampsia in pregnant and postpartum patients. Preeclampsia affects 1 in 20 births, or 150,000 women in the U.S. each year. Not only does Preeclampsia cost 70,000 lives globally each year, it is also an expensive burden for healthcare systems.  It costs nearly three times more to treat a patient with preeclampsia than one without this complication. When deployed at scale, the technology proposed in this SBIR grant could be a key factor to reducing maternal mortality in the United States, improving obstetric patient outcomes, reducing the cost of obstetric care, and helping to reduce health disparities.

    The proposed project will research and develop a method to potentially detect preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. This dangerous condition also costs the U.S. healthcare system $2.18 billion per year or one-third of the total amount spent on maternal healthcare in our country. Research objectives include optimizing a machine learning model, integrating patient-facing software into Electronic Health Records systems, implementing the predictive model for preeclampsia, integrating with peripheral wellness devices, developing reminder notification mechanisms, determining appropriate interface enhancements, and defining commercialization and regulatory strategies.  Improving maternal health outcomes advances the general health and welfare of American families and can improve our country?s economic competitiveness on the world stage.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce a cost-effective way to produce recombinant proteins and growth factors for the cultivated meat industry. Cultivating animal cells to create animal tissues, including muscle and fat, allows manufacturers to create real animal meat as an alternative to animal-farmed meat. Producing meat in this method may provide a healthier, safer, and more ethical source of real animal meat. This manufacturing process avoids industrial animal farming and consequently uses significantly less land and water. It also avoids the greenhouse gases emitted by industrial animal farming and may emit far fewer greenhouse gases. Cultivated meat could result in a healthier public as well since its controlled production will likely result in fewer foodborne illnesses and avoid the cramped conditions of industrial animal farms that can breed new illnesses. The ability to grow meat in nearly any location increases the nation?s food supply chain resilience and reduces dependence on foreign food imports. Finally, by reducing the amount of industrial animal farms, cultivated meat reduces the need for animal slaughter.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the ability of the innovation to solve several challenges in the current production of recombinant proteins and growth factors in traditional protein manufacturing platforms that prevent manufacturing at lower costs and with high purity. Cultivated meat has the potential to disrupt the >$1 trillion meat industry, but the ability to source high purity, cheap proteins limits the commercial adoption of cultivated meat products. The innovation could produce proteins at cheaper costs than existing platforms because it bypasses expensive and time-consuming operational manufacturing steps while still achieving high purity. The critical technical objectives of this project include: 1) the establishment and comparison of a production benchmark for recombinant growth factor production against the current industry standards, 2) the optimization of the growth conditions necessary for the protein production platform to achieve improved yields, and 3) the creation of a manufacturing platform optimization toolkit to increase the quality and amount of usable protein produced. The knowledge gained at the completion of this project may provide valuable insights into the ability and conditions to promote high production levels of proteins and growth factors while providing data illustrating the improvement when compared against current industry standards.

    \ Phase I project is to develop novel off-the-shelf T cell immunotherapies. Adoptive\
    \ Cell Therapy (ACT) has revolutionized medicine for cancer patients, as evidenced\
    \ by the remarkable success of CAR-T therapies in treating advanced and refractory\
    \ leukemia and lymphoma. Despite the success in blood malignancies, solid tumors,\
    \ representing approximately 90% of cancers, remain difficult to cure. To eradicate\
    \ large tumor masses and reach complete remission, successful ACT requires persistent,\
    \ in vivo anti-tumor effects. Studies have highlighted the correlation between\
    \ greater ACT efficacy and transferring T cells with capacity of in vivo expansion\
    \ and memory formation. Among major T cell subsets, naïve T cells have been identified\
    \ as the optimal cell source for ACT compared to further differentiated cell types.\
    \ In vivo, naïve T-derived effector cells demonstrate robust proliferation, potent\
    \ tumor-killing and resistance to terminal differentiation and exhaustion. In\
    \ vitro, these cells have significantly higher efficiency for blood malignancies\
    \ and solid tumors. This project may enable large-scale and renewable production\
    \ of homogenous T cells with optimal and persistent tumor-killing properties.\
    \ This approach aims to address the unmet challenges of T cell exhaustion, improve\
    \ scalability, reduce repeated blood collection, and offer broad patient access.\
    \ \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a platform technology for generation\
    \ of iPSC-derived nai?ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with fidelity, reproducibility\
    \ and scalability. The platform employs a proprietary method to generate iPSC-derived\
    \ thymic epithelial cells as a critical element to enable naïve T cell production.\
    \ The rationale resides in the natural biology of the Thymus, where the transition\
    \ of immature CD4+CD8+ double positive T cells to nai?ve CD4+ or CD8+ T cells\
    \ requires interaction with thymic epithelial cells through a process called positive\
    \ selection. Concerns have been raised regarding the therapeutic efficacy associated\
    \ with current Notch-activation based iPSC-derived T cell methods because T cells\
    \ developed through sole Notch activation are phenotypically and functionally\
    \ different from nai?ve T cells. Major technical limitations in Notch activation-based\

    \ relevant thymic positive selection signals. The resulting product enables a\
    \ significant advance in the development of iPSC-based T cell immunotherapies\
    \ with clinically relevant cell fidelity. Reproducibility and scalability of the\
    \ proposed platform will be assessed and optimized in a bioreactor to demonstrate\

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing software to enhance the performance of existing radar hardware on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Despite development of ADAS sensing technologies, there are, on average, 14,386 car accidents per day in the United States alone. The performance of these technologies still needs to be improved significantly to ensure the safety of drivers. This project will transform the performance of current ADAS systems, reducing the number of car crashes and fatalities that occur daily. The total addressable market size for ADAS radar is estimated to be $6.61 billion, and this is the fastest growing market among all ADAS sensors. The current radar technology improvements being introduced today are focused on hardware, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These current technologies are addressing issues that deal with resolution, but they come with the negative effects of slower processing times, higher cost, and less efficiency. The successful development of the software solutions in this project will disrupt the ADAS industry as this innovation is physics-based and can unlock the true potential of radar performance.

    The intellectual merit of this project is focused on developing and deploying a software suite for remote sensing and data transmission using existing hardware. The software suite involves three primary steps: locating objects, identifying objects, and communicating the findings to other vehicles and/or infrastructure in the surrounding environment. The first two steps fall underneath the remote sensing category. The third falls under the communications category. Simulation development will be done for all three steps. Once robust simulations have been developed, the remote sensing portion of the software suite will be tested on an industry standard radar unit. The anticipated outcome of the test deployment is that the remote sensing piece of the software suite will enable conventional ADAS radars to achieve higher resolution and lower latency. This deployment is the first step in hardware development to create a safer and complete ADAS software suite. The results will be used to assess the reliability and feasibility of the proposed software suite in a real-world environment. Additionally, the results will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the software suite by benchmarking performance against current ADAS radar performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to reduce power infrastructure bottlenecks to the deployment of electric vehicle fast chargers. Typically, it is expensive to install high power electric vehicle fast chargers because of limited power availability or demand charges. A large network of electric vehicle fast chargers would reduce range anxiety among electric vehicle drivers and accelerate the electrification of transportation overall. Energy storage systems can be used to build a ?buffer? between low power availability at a site and high-power fast chargers by accumulating and then rapidly discharging energy, but conventional chemical batteries have a limited cycle life which degrades faster in high-power applications. Kinetic batteries (such as those based on flywheels), on the other hand, could enable this without having to be replaced and without hazardous byproducts. Modular, cost-effective ?buffers? could be deployed anywhere and everywhere an electric vehicle fast charger is required and where power availability is limited.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to fabricate, test, and deploy a pilot 100 kWh / 400 kW modular kinetic battery system into a 350 kW electric vehicle charging station along with commercial partners to validate whether the system can act as a drop-in solution. This project enables high-power, fast electric vehicle charging utilizing the existing, low-power grid connections. This project has three basic objectives: 1) fabricate a kinetic battery module with 100 kWh energy storage capacity and 400 kW power output, 2) conduct a rigorous test of the kinetic battery as part of a high-power electric vehicle charger, and 3) design a high-power, alternating current homopolar motor/generator which can provide damping forces to the rotor passively via its windings. This kinetic battery system implements a passively stable magnetic bearing system which enables larger module sizes (reduces balance of system costs and operating expenses) and can connect to the grid synchronously, eliminating the need for costly power electronics and enabling it to provide grid-stabilizing physical inertia as an ancillary service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to dramatically improve the corrosion protection of metal assets vital to the energy and transportation industries.  Corrosion contributes to the loss of structural integrity of metal structures, which poses a risk to human safety and the surrounding environment. Metal corrosion costs an estimated $2.5 T globally, with US costs representing roughly 25%.  Durable, anticorrosive, highly water-repellent coatings using special materials can potentially double the lifetime of coatings on oil platforms and ships in a way that protects the environment. This extends maintenance cycles and reduces asset lifetime maintenance costs up to 50%. The high performance will also reduce the number of coating layers, reducing labor costs up to 25% per maintenance cycle.  This technology will improve structural safety, reduce maintenance frequency, lengthen the operating lifetimes, improve environmental characteristics, and reduce the costs of operating and maintaining metal assets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project further translates coatings of superhydrophobic smart particles for high-performance anticorrosion paints.  These superhydrophobic particles offer new on-demand release of corrosion inhibitors (active corrosion protection) and superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) into one multi-functional material, unlike current state of practice. The platform nature of the technology enables inclusion of numerous types of corrosion inhibitors to safeguard delicate marine environments. Smart particles can then be incorporated into many existing coating systems to deliver a unique combination of durable, anticorrosive, and highly water-repellent coatings. This project will optimize production processes and conduct verification and validation tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of low-cost, flexible displays allowing smart objects to better communicate with their users. Researchers estimate that in 2017 there were 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that were not computers, estimated to grow to 125 billion by 2025. These Internet of Things devices are already used in many applications for transportation, health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. These devices can enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety; they will require displays that are thin, low power, flexible or curved, and easy to read. A near-term need is autonomous transportation, which will need a method of visual communication between vehicle and rider.  This project will develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays; just this initial transportation application will help improve mobility for the elderly and disabled, traffic safety, and related needs.  In the longer term, this project will enable manufacturing of improved displays with reduced processing waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix (OLED) displays. These displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography, a slow and expensive process. The high-resolution printable anode developed here replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process, laying the foundation for fully roll-to-roll printed displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is creating a tool for police officers and other service members who are expected to perform their job duties under high stress.  This Phase 1 project seeks to develop a technology that creates stress scores and alerts users when they are in ?red zones? for decision making based on physiological monitoring via a wearable sensor unit. The initial target market segment for this technology is the ~$1 billion law enforcement market as there is a high need for tools that can help de-escalate situations and potentially improve the use-of-force decisions. The pain points of acute stress impacting decision-making have been validated in military and professional athletic markets as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wearable technology that uses skin conductivity to measure stress and alert users via vibrational feedback. This Phase 1 project proposes to: (1) run a pilot study on police officers to collect skin conductance data during scenario training, (2) build machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) models with a high predictive accuracy of poor decision making using this data, (3) determine ideal sensor location and build a custom wearable strap attachment, (4) develop the mobile application to build a data visualization interface for officers and trainers, and (5) test the effectiveness of delivering vibrational feedback during decision making of officers using the prototype. The successful conclusion of Phase 1 may lead to a hardware-software prototype that measures the police officers' emotional stress using a skin conductance signal, then alerts the user via vibrational feedback when they are in a heightened level of stress.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to bring new and more diverse audiences to circuit design and digital fabrication through an integrated STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) approach.  Research shows that the STEAM approach is especially successful for reaching underrepresented minorities, girls, and women. This project continues the development of the Phase I circuit design software and accompanying physical toolkit for do-it-yourself (DIY) digital fabrication of circuits on paper. Through the design, development, and evaluation of this toolkit, the team will contribute to the scientific understanding of human computer interaction design for STEAM learning, accessibility, and equity. By introducing the novel category of technology-integrated crafts to mainstream education and craft markets, open market opportunities create a new ecosystem of products and accessories, customers, and inventors. This innovation brings the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditional technical environments and into entirely new, more mainstream, and more diverse audiences.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of the Phase I activities towards commercial deployment. The team is developing a novel electronics design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing computer-aided design tools and prepares a custom toolkit optimized for the do-it-yourself digital fabrication of circuits. The research objective is to blend engineering activities with arts and crafts in innovative ways to radically reduce the barriers to entry for learning, designing, and producing electronic circuits. The team will develop a production version of their software that includes advanced simulation and design features, as well as a library of projects and resources to scaffold the circuit learning and design process. The team will also refine and manufacture the toolkit for user testing and deployment at scale. In close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters, the technology will be developed to meet the needs of target users.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
