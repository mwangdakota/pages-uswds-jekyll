    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to significantly reduce the number of injuries or deaths suffered by pavement marking workers on public streets and roads, while increasing the efficiency and lowering costs by using an operator-driven, truck-mounted, mobile robotic pavement marking system. Robotic painting allows workers to remain in the safety of the truck cab, protecting them from traffic.  Increased efficiency will help to minimize work zone congestion and duration, while reduced costs will enable safer and more productive streetscapes for the general public. Studies have repeatedly confirmed that streetscapes with a high density of transverse marking features such as shared center turning lanes, dedicated bike lanes with separation buffer zones, and pedestrian-friendly crosswalks result in measurable public health benefits, enhanced quality of life, increased commercial activity, and, counterintuitively, more efficient traffic flow with fewer collisions. The project will also better enable precise placement of new markings and precise overpainting of worn or eroded markings, both important factors for connected and autonomous vehicles. An earlier phase of the project has already resulted in enhancements to camera calibration techniques for machine vision.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to build on a successful Phase I effort to enable a commercially-viable robotic road painting system that addresses the need to protect the lives of human workers engaged in the dangerous task of stenciling roadway markings such as turn arrows or bike symbols. The project may also improve the accuracy and ease of application of markings needed to support autonomous vehicle-ready roadways. The research will apply advanced software, machine vision, an augmented-reality user interface, and proprietary robotic trajectory planning technologies to support ultraprecision painting in the real-world environment while keeping human workers safe in the cab of the operator-driven truck upon which the robot is mounted. The solution will enable robots to paint previously unmarked pavement and to repaint existing marks. The combined hardware and software solution will be capable of recording all planned and completed markings in a cloud-hosted database—an innovation that will streamline the processes.  The technology will also form a cloud-based standard for mapping and recording universal road markings and support the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate safely. While much of the research can initially be performed in simulation, significant real-world testing and validation will be required as well.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II is to improve the mobility of wheelchair users.  There are more than 2.5 M wheelchair users in the US. This project will develop an electronic aftermarket add-on accessory to increase manual wheelchair users’ height up to 18 inches or more in 5 seconds. The new wheelchair lift (WL) will increase their Quality of Life and their ability to independently perform activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, dressing) and instrumental activities of daily living (transportation, shopping, cooking, doing laundry, and housework). The solution will replace expensive home retrofitting ($20 K) and will reduce the need for help in outside settings, such as reaching for items on shelves, empowering the users. The WL will bridge the gap between the disabled and the able-bodied population, providing a means to increase wheelchair users’ participation in the labor force (currently only 20%) and enabling more employment options. Similarly, the WL will offer employers an effective way to support workers with disabilities and reduce costs to adapt the work environment to provide reasonable accommodations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to generate a final functional prototype of the wheelchair lift (WL) ready for usability tests with end-users. The Phase II project extends prior work on a prototype satisfying the major design specifications of weight, lift maximum load, and time of ascension, de-risking the most significant technological challenges associated with the project. The proposed activities will enable systems engineering of hardware and electronics development and the next generation prototype for testing and regulatory clearance. The prototype will be produced under Quality Management Systems and an industrial manufacturing process will be established.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve vertical farms. The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density.

    This SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement.  Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to allow America’s grape industry to reduce crop losses due to spring frost, estimated at over $1 billion per year, as well as related job losses – more than 11,000 individuals in the State of Washington alone.  The encapsulating bud break delay technology and predictive analytics support farmers with decision making tools ahead of impending frost events during bud break season.  Such tools may enable rural communities to achieve economic stability by decreasing yield losses and lowering production costs.  The technology fills gaps in knowledge needed to make informed decisions on individual farms, resulting in better management decisions in the face of increasing complexities of spring freeze threats. Additionally, use of the encapsulation technology may reduce carbon emissions and water usage from current fossil fuel-intensive conventional frost mitigation measures such as burners, wind machines and sprinklers.

    The proposed encapsulating bud break delay technology involves two main advances. First, a gel encapsulation spray biologically delays the process of bud break consistently up to 14 days and increases cold resistance up to 6 degrees Celsius. Second, to guide growers in delivering this product, a Decision Support System (DSS) aids grape growers in deciding when it is necessary to mitigate pending frost conditions. The Phase II project focuses on increasing the predictive accuracy of the DSS and scaling the system. Specifically, the team will focus on: a) optimizing the formulation and testing in the lab, b) field-testing and data collection at five sites, c) enhancing DSS capabilities with additional data and analysis, d) scaling up for large-scale manufacture and application, and e) gathering data for regulatory approvals. This gel encapsulation solution for frost protection of vineyards may find future applications in other fruits crops such as apples and stones fruits that are even more susceptible to spring frost damage than grapes.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of renewable electricity.  Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by 2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account for as much as 85% of total costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at scale.

    The  broader  impact/commercial  potential  of  this  Small  Business  Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the support of newborn and infant health services at the point-of-care (i.e., in pediatrician offices and at home). This project will develop quantitative imagining and machine learning technology that will allow pediatricians to evaluate and monitor the infant’s head development during well-child visits and/or remotely. If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized  clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone. These parameters are commonly used to monitor child development, and in the diagnosis and treatment planning of common conditions with head deformations. In this  project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies. This approach can handle object motion and can be implemented directly on a smartphone/tablet to compute full three-dimensional shape analysis.

    This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the productivity, environmental sustainability, and profitability of soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is a major driver of rainforest deforestation, motivating improved yields for environmental sustainability.  In addition, current commercial soybean varieties are highly susceptible to Asian soybean rust, an aggressive fungal disease that is especially severe in tropical and subtropical climates and can decimate soybean yield. This disease is controlled by chemical fungicides that are expensive, pose risks to the environment and human health, and are becoming less effective as the pathogen develops tolerance to over-used chemicals. This project will enable the development of soybean varieties immune to this disease. This will reduce the need for fungicide use in soybean cultivation, reduce yield loss caused by the pathogen, and improve grower profitability. In addition, this technology can be expanded to other crops.

    The proposed project will result in the identification of new plant disease resistance traits with activity against the pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust. The typical plant species has hundreds of immune receptor genes which surveil for the presence of invading pathogens. Plant breeders routinely use plant immune receptor genes to develop new disease-resistant crop varieties. However, traditional methods to identify and translate these traits are time-consuming. The proposed work utilizes a rapid gene discovery platform to accelerate identification of new disease resistance traits. This project will identify and test several resistance traits. The identification and cloning of these resistance gene sequences will allow them to be quickly moved into elite soybean varieties, resulting in significant time and labor savings relative to traditional breeding. These traits can be stacked together to confer durable resistance against a broad range of Asian soybean rust strains.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.

    The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

- abstractText: "Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) offers tremendous benefit for rapid\
    \ prototyping, mass customization, and low cost fabrication. This creates an untapped\
    \ opportunity to develop the technology further to support low volume industrial\
    \ manufacturing for price sensitive and emerging markets. The ability to source\
    \ locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into\
    \ a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer\
    \ and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping.\
    \ The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial\
    \ objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale\
    \ products represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are\
    \ ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet\
    \ extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on\
    \ extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the\
    \ ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise\
    \ in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet\
    \ 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs\
    \ by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and\
    \ feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics. \n\n\nre:3D intends to leverage\
    \ Phase I research conducted on material requirements for polyethylene terephthalate\
    \ (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available reclaimed plastics worldwide,\
    \ to further optimize the pellet printer to be able to accept reclaimed flake\
    \ as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include developing the ability\
    \ to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean and switch between\
    \ materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake\
    \ into the platform will also be developed with the requisite controls. Once complete,\
    \ the company will pilot the solution in Texas through IC2 as well as in Puerto\
    \ Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain, in conjunction with\
    \ waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science & Research Trust.\
    \ The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2 will be incorporated\
    \ into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan Technological University's\
    \ (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior\
    \ work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source\
    \ firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively\
    \ tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used\
    \ for casting, mold production and load bearing applications. Once the prototype\
    \ design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU and field-tested,\
    \ all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort to scale the\
    \ solution suite to multiple platforms as quickly as possible. The hardware will\
    \ be sold commercially after completing the project as both an integrated 3D printing\
    \ solution and also as independent hardware due to the potential to be applied\
    \ beyond Cartesian 3D printing systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop a medical device for valve replacement treatment of chronic insufficiency of the veins (CVI). Currently, no definitive treatment option exists to address the underlying cause of the disease, valvular reflux, which leaves millions of patients with chronic venous ulcers, skin thickening, and pain for years to decades. When brought to market, the proposed novel prosthetic valve and delivery system will provide a viable curative therapy superior to current treatment options and mitigating complications associated with existing valve prostheses, such as thrombosis and valve incompetence. The proposed product will curtail substantial health care expenditures associated with CVI, such as wound care, hospitalizations for infections, and associated secondary procedures. Because implantation of this valve does not require the complex or invasive surgical interventions of existing technologies, its use also will avoid expenses associated with open surgical procedures and rehabilitative care. The commercialization of this innovation is expected to benefit CVI patients, while significantly reducing costs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel, reliable, and marketable prosthetic valve and delivery system for the treatment of incompetent veins. In Phase I, a design was created for a device that exceeded laboratory and animal benchmarks. Phase II proposed development improves the design for broader deployment by demonstrating the the valve's ability to minimize thrombosis as well as the capability to be produced at scale. Phase II objectives are to:  1) Develop and produce the next generation valve for in vitro and animal testing; 2) Compare safety of valve designs in an in vitro study; 3) Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the leading design in a chronic animal study; 4) Complete biocompatibility testing on the design to ensure it is appropriate for human testing; and 5) Establish manufacturability of the device. These steps will provide the foundation for future clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in humans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    \ Phase II project focuses on an adaptive traffic signal timing solution. Cities\
    \ and municipalities worldwide spend over $4 billion annually to retime traffic\
    \ signals and yet often fail to adequately reduce congestion on roadways. The\
    \ consequences of mistimed traffic signal timing are: a) increasing productivity\
    \ losses due to congestion with the average American spending 97 hours stuck in\
    \ traffic every year, b) increasing accidents due to traffic, with one fatality\
    \ every 15 minutes on US roads, and c) increasing greenhouse emissions with a\
    \ third of all emissions caused by vehicles on the roads. This project will support\
    \ the development and commercialization of a web-based technology to support traffic\
    \ managers in cities and municipalities to better manage traffic using artificial\
    \ intelligence (AI) and big data analytics. In addition to improving traffic flow\
    \ and reducing congestion, the system will also significantly reduce harmful emissions,\
    \ leading to more environmentally friendly city streets. The serviceable markets\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis, and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer and other diseases.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted surveillance test.  A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals.  This Phase II project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it will enhance the machine-learning-based matching methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate development of immunotherapeutics and make them broadly available and affordable to patients in need. Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact.  Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value).

    The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seek to improve the quality of life for manufacturing workers, help U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improve the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells may reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The developed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants perform the low-level tedious tasks. Moreover, this technology enables the human operator to guide the team operation. This ability will improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. performing composite fabrication. Most of these companies face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn. These challenges lead to longer delivery times. This project may  enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, the technology may enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing the reliance on human labor and easily scaling production capacity with the change in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robotic sanding solution for high-mix applications by providing safety under uncertainty during robotic sanding and reducing cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient trajectories by the robot. This award will make computational advances to enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description.  The project will also enable the computational algorithms to account for the uncertainties present in the environment, making robots useful for sanding operations in high-mix applications. A robotic sanding cell for handling large parts in high-mix applications will be developed by selecting the appropriate sensors and tools. Algorithms will be developed for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell while the workpiece is secured with a cost-effective, general-purpose, low-cost fixture. Algorithms will be developed to determine the minimum number of setups needed for sanding large parts in the robotic cell and to generate robot trajectories to produce tool motion patterns that ensure efficient and safe sanding operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the resiliency of the supply chain by implementing flexible robotic systems for materials handling.  The robotic systems that are controlled by artificial intelligence. E-commerce sales are increasing 20% year over year. During the COVID-19 pandemic additional retail volume shifted online and many customers became accustomed to sourcing essentials using e-commerce. This shift has put a greater burden on asupply chain infrastructure that has traditionally relied on human labor to pick, sort, pack, and process items for delivery. These manual processes are monotonous, error-prone, and sometimes dangerous, have extremely high worker turnover. The automation of these processes elevates worker roles and brings greater consistency to the processes. The innovation developed during this Phase II project may enable broader automation of complex materials handling processes by creating novel training systems for artificial intelligence-enabled robotic systems that are configured specifically for individual customer needs. This innovation may increase US supply chain resilience, enabling citizens to rapidly and reliably obtain necessities such as food, medicine, and health supplies without needing to leave their homes. The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a high-throughput biofabrication platform that can create physiologically relevant in vitro tissue models for diverse applications including drug testing, assay development, therapeutics, and biomedical research. The current drug development process is lengthy, inefficient, and expensive. It costs about $1.8 billion and takes 12-15 years to launch a single drug. Approximately 92% of the drugs that passed preclinical testing failed in subsequent human trials, highlighting the lack of adequate preclinical testing tools to generate predictive data. Failure to detect the drug-induced toxicity to the vital human organs in clinical trials often leads to market withdrawal of the drug after launch, which causes enormous financial losses to the drug manufacturer and also negative physical and mental effects for patients. The proposed technology will significantly improve drug safety, increase the efficiency and lower the cost of drug development by providing more reliable and clinically relevant drug testing results in a high-throughput fashion. This technology can also provide patient-specific tissues for critical biomedical research (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo therapeutic applications, providing a viable solution to diseases without no cures or effective treatment yet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-throughput biofabrication platform that is compatible with the high-throughput screening (HTS) systems widely used for drug screening and assay development. Currently, the key bottleneck for traditional microfabrication strategies and mainstream nozzle-based bioprinters is the lack of scalability and throughput to accommodate scalable manufacturing necessary in HTS systems. With the growing adoption of 3D biomimetic human tissue models in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a critical need for advanced manufacturing systems that enable rapid and streamlined tissue fabrication methods that are compatible with already established HTS platforms for preclinical toxicity testing of potential drug candidates. The proposed project will develop a parallel optical projection-based 3D bioprinting platform for direct manufacturing of 3D tissues within multiwell plates commonly used in the HTS systems. Implementation of the proposed 3D bioprinting system will permit subsequent in situ drug screening or assay testing directly within the wells and drastically improve biofabrication workflow efficiencies for the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research community. This bioprinter will serve as a powerful instrument for the mass production of 3D tissue models at the industrial scale to advance drug discovery and assay development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project will be to empower and educate caregivers to make scientifically guided decisions that enable safer and optimally nurturing sleep environments for infants.  Every year more than 130 million babies are born and over 4 million of those are born in the U.S.  Due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 300 babies every month may not live to see their first birthday.  SIDS remains the leading cause of death for babies aged one month to one year.  Infant mortality rates in the U.S. are higher than in the 20 wealthiest nations.  Innogized Technologies has developed a transformative Internet of Things technology (IoT) that combines hardware and analytics to enable caregivers to make better sleep-time decisions, avoiding overheating, a known stressor for SIDS.  The technology guides caregivers to deliver optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth for their infants anywhere and anytime, while at the same time relieving anxiety.  This technology is poised to immediately capture a sizable portion of the rapidly growing $1 billion US baby monitoring solutions market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a novel consumer product that works  with caregivers to proactively mitigate the risk of under/overheating events in newborns. Sleep-time clothing choices are thermodynamically matched with environmental conditions to create baby-specific safe sleep environments.  The temperatures are  maintained by leveraging the inherent connectivity of the IoT platform. The technology integrates thermal resistance measurements, thermal models and maps, advanced algorithms, and predictive monitoring.  The research objectives of the project tackle the most important remaining technical challenges driving towards successful commercialization and adoption of a product that is essentially an intelligent system, capable of understanding context and tracking and managing complex interactions while anticipating requirements.  The technical product of this research will advance caregiver knowledge and increase understanding of the applied thermodynamics leading to the advantageous state of thermoneutrality as well as increase infant wellbeing.

    This broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop low-cost, biodegradable biopolymers to replace non-degradable, single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.  Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.

    The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability of a novel reactive extrusion technology, capable of producing biodegradable and compostable thermoplastics with lignin contents of at least 50 weight percent, using solvent-free reactive processing. The polymer alloys will have mechanical properties comparable to commodity polymers, such as low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and thermophilic composting conditions in under 6 months. These materials will be validated for commercial scale production using twin-screw extruders, converted to raw material feedstocks used in plastics manufacturing including filament, pellets, and sheet, and then converted with standard equipment into products such as containers for agriculture, floral, and forestry plant production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make it possible for astrophysicists to dramatically expand their ability to collect the spectra of distant galaxies, and so to advance their understanding of the universe. The most important factor in large-scale spectrographic data collection is the number of spectra taken per viewing hour. The planned Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) is mechanically simpler than the current state-of-the-art positioning systems; it will cost less to produce per installed fiber, and it will provide more fibers per unit area than any existing design. The spectra of galaxies is critical to dark energy and dark matter research programs, and these programs address the greatest open questions in astrophysics today. The relative simplicity of the DFPS mechanical components makes it a better choice for spectrographs of tens of thousands of fibers, but also for much smaller arrays of a few hundred fibers, such as could be installed on smaller telescopes. Thus, the DFPS will win a share of the small market for very large spectrographic instruments, but also to create for itself a large market for smaller spectrographic instruments.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a small Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 fibers on a 5-mm grid. Each fiber will provide a 3.6-mm x 3.6-mm range of motion and will be controlled by electronic circuits consuming less than 20 mW. A calibrated camera will view the illuminated fiber tips, monitoring their position with an accuracy of 10 µm, to measure and demonstrate the precision and repeatability of the fiber positioner. The stability of the positioner will be determined over the course an hour in warm and cold environments, and in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The direct method of fiber movement requires accurate control of voltages applied to many fibers in parallel, which is a challenging electrical engineering problem that has been avoided by other, mechanically complex systems. If we can locate fibers with an accuracy of 10 µm in the focal plane of a telescope, we will be able to provide a new and superior type of fiber-positioner, one that will be more compact, less vulnerable to mechanical failure, less susceptible to corrosion, and more resistant to fatigue than any other existing fiber-positioning system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device supporting multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. The success of this project would not only benefit patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce health care expenditures by decreasing the length of hospitalization as well as associated medical resources. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research brings together academic collaborators from different fields of expertise. The project provides a unique experience and training for engineers and scientists in the fields of neural interface design and medical device experiments, bridging the gap between the engineering and medical communities, as well as promoting and cultivating future neural engineers to focus on developing emerging/unmet diagnostic and therapeutic devices for improving human health.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops and demonstrates a wireless, miniaturized, intraluminal bioelectronic capsule capable of performing on-demand neuromodulation and multi-modality sensing on the gastrointestinal tract, supporting closed-loop neuromodulation. The device will be tested and characterized on benchtop and also through porcine models to demonstrate its potential for treating and monitoring post-surgical complications. The lengthy process of diagnosing and treating post-surgical complications significantly increases healthcare costs. Costs from hospitalization time alone exceed $2,000 per day for post-operative ileus alone.  Additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could reduce hospitalization time, accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life for patients. The success of this project has the potential to bring disruptive impact and revolution to the current pharmaceutical-based post-surgical management and treatment. In addition, the technology developed during this project may be useful to treat other chronic diseases and injuries that are incurable pharmaceutically.  The technique may be used as research tools for investigating the biological mechanisms and new therapeutics for different diseases.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to optimize a system to rapidly synthesize long, user-defined sequences of DNA as a commercial service. The process will be capable of producing error-free DNA fragments, each long enough to encode multiple genes, in 1-2 weeks, at a price that will be affordable even to university research labs. Researchers currently can purchase short DNA fragments that must be stitched together to make functional genes – which is labor-intensive and sometimes impossible – or pay vendors to do it. The ability to buy an intact group of genes on one piece of DNA will help deepen the understanding of all biological systems, from animals and plants to the bacteria and viruses that infect them. Easy access to long DNAs will also allow synthetic biologists to build completely novel biological devices, such as bacteria that manufacture vitamins or medicines, cells that detect and destroy cancer, or new sustainable food ingredients and novel biomaterials.

    The proposed project is focused on developing an enzymatic method for DNA synthesis that will alleviate several problems inherent to chemical DNA synthesis, the only method currently available commercially. Chemical synthesis works well for short DNA fragments, but high-quality synthesis is limited to <200 bases. Longer fragments often are created by stitching together many short fragments, but this process is unreliable for sequences that contain repeats or high AT or GC content. In the proposed enzymatic DNA synthesis method, a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is conjugated to the template-independent polymerase Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) by a cleavable linker. When presented with a DNA primer, the dNTP-TdT conjugate adds its tethered nucleotide and remains attached, blocking further elongation by other conjugates. Cleavage of the linker releases the TdT, to be washed away with unreacted conjugates, and exposes the oligo for extension with the next dNTP-TdT conjugate. These two steps of “extension” and “deprotection” are iterated to synthesize a defined sequence. The accuracy of the resulting DNA strand depends on the stability and cleavage efficiency of the linker. A variety of linkages and cleavage enzymes will be tested to yield >99.9% stability and cleavage in rapid, 30-second reactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a software application that identifies clinical outcomes to support high validity real-world evidence (RWE). Approaches to ensure data accuracy and protocol validity are critical to maintain safety and efficacy in healthcare.  This project will analyze electronic health data to generate clinically meaningful information for personalized treatment plans for patients with multiple conditions that can confound treatment. This technology will fulfill an unmet need to improve patient outcomes, improve healthcare delivery and chronic disease care management, and reduce healthcare costs for patients. This technology can also improve regulatory and reimbursement decision-making for therapeutic approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the need for consideration of using additional health data to allow for individualized personalized therapeutic plans for patients with multiple co-morbidities. Subgroup analysis or individualized therapy plans for precision medicine are currently not available based upon the structure of randomized controlled trials for broad conditions like breast cancer or hypertension. This proposal seeks to identify clinical outcomes from unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR). The proposed work is to develop analytics using natural language processing and inference to leverage the large amounts of health data from real-world evidence (RWE) and observational studies to augment data provided in randomized controlled trials (RCT). The analytic tools will allow a comparison of the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in defined cohorts of patients and develop a personalized treatment plan for an individual patient with multiple co-morbidities. The tasks include: 1) Leverage linguistic phrases extracted by natural language processing (NLP) to recognize outcome-related clinical findings to be maintained as clinical feature metadata; 2) Combine NLP and inference to accurately identify candidate clinical outcomes; and 3) Apply machine-learned and expert knowledge to accurately define complex outcome measures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves both reduced costs for technology companies as well as increased access to cutting-edge engineering jobs for people from all backgrounds.  Commercializing this product will provide the market with an innovative, automated solution that reduces the time hiring managers spend on recruiting and growing the best candidates.  Until now, metacognitive skill development has been the purview of in-person mentors – a practice that provides fewer on-ramps into engineering careers for individuals from backgrounds historically underrepresented in technology as they often lack access to in-person engineer mentors. A scalable system which delivers metacognitive benefits to users in an automated way may create greater access to technology education by reducing the need for in-person mentorship. The product will also enable job seekers to enhance their engineering potential by strengthening the "hard to teach" practices which distinguish professional engineers from aspiring ones. Overall, the product commercialized during Phase II seeks to increase broader participation in engineering careers and a more equitable set of hiring practices in technology companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project brings cutting-edge Cognitive Science to bear on the problems of manual candidate screening and ongoing employee upskilling. For the first-time, it marries an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and opens the door to build talent pipelines for individuals whose metacognitive traits match closely with the needs of tech employers.  The proposed project combines key advances in the field of Cognitive Science with best practices in software design in order to create novel user interactions inside a Computer-Based Learning Environment (CBLE).  Objectives include: 1) collecting microdata (also called "trace data") from user interactions to make automated inferences about the user's metacognitive traits and 2) creating inputs designed to foster metacognitive growth.  Correlating real-time trace data with metacognitive ability is a new area of research enabled only recently by the increased adoption of CBLEs.  The proposed project contributes to the fields of Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction by validating novel methods measuring metacognition against existing static look-back techniques. The project also pioneers new modes of delivering personalized metacognitive growth through CBLE interaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, high-performance platform to monitor and characterize plankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be harmful or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns and economic consequences, such as billions lost annually in the aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms and sea lice. The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collections and evaluation. In contrast, the proposed platform may enable low-cost, portable and fast monitoring, as well as automated characterization of harmful aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, this platform will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets such as marine biology science and STEM education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, and production algae monitoring. The proposed technology is envisioned to have a significant societal impact and commercial potential.

    This project may result in a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput aquatic microobjects monitoring instrument.  The instrument will have a wide spectrum of applications and initial focus on aquaculture market. The technology will initially focus on early identification of specific microorganisms, such as sea lice and harmful algae as they are detrimental to the wellbeing of aquaculture animals. This demonstration will provide high quality data at an affordable price to ensure confidence and credibility to aquaculture farmers, marine scientists, and other users interested in aquatic microobjects characterization. To accomplish this plan, several operating regimes will be implemented enabling the device to switch from high-resolution (monitoring harmful algae) to high-throughput (identifying sea lice).  An autofluorescent camera module will be developed to further assist with differentiating microorganisms. Next, an innovative neural network framework will be developed and tested for identification of different types of sea lice and harmful algae. Finally, the system will be integrated into an environmentally protected enclosure and rigorously tested in laboratory, as well as in-field in realistic conditions. At the end of the Phase II program a prototype will be completed that will be designed in coordination with aquaculture partners and prospective users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient system for robust point-of-care blood tests.  The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and represent a bottleneck.  This Phase II effort will explore the design and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated by comparison
    of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead separation assay with a conventional centrifugation process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the efficiency of air traffic operations and increase airport and airspace capacity utilization, enabling reductions in emissions, noise impact, flight delays, and operational costs of airports and airlines. The anticipated result is to produce a software platform that will become an industry standard used by 200 major metropolitan airports and over 50 airlines globally, addressing an available market of over $100 Million. The technology may contribute to a sustainable future aviation system that enables economic growth, while minimizing environmental impact. Preliminary development and testing of the technology in New York indicates the potential to increase airport and airspace capacity by as much as 20%, with savings for delays, fuel burn, noise impact and controller workload from 10%-21%, and cost savings of $2 Billion/year. The proposed innovation may increase the understanding of airspace operations and related trade-offs by bridging the gap between aviation professionals and the public through 3D visualizations of proposed airspace changes and quantification of their expected impacts on the environment and safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a software platform for integrated airspace and airport system planning, design, and management. Currently, airport authorities, airlines, and air navigation service providers use legacy software tools for the above. These tools are outdated and difficult to use, fail to properly quantify trade-offs between design objectives, and produce unsustainable design solutions leading to sub-optimal system performance. The research objectives of this project are to unify the disjointed functions of design, planning and performance evaluation of airport operations, quantify trade-offs between competing design objectives, and optimize for system efficiency in terms of maximizing safety and capacity while minimizing delays, emissions, noise, fuel burn and operational cost. To achieve this, the company will work with major airports and airlines to identify key requirements, develop tractable mathematical models for addressing the tasks and validate the results via application in real operational environments. The anticipated technical result is a unified software platform that will enable airports/airlines to be more efficient, while also balancing operational, societal, and environmental objectives in building a sustainable aviation system for the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting parameters. Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually.  However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients’ quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help advance the health and welfare of individuals living with retinal and neurological disease. This includes multiple sclerosis (MS)—a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A fully automated, wearable, and low-cost retinal imaging device will be developed for use in both clinical and home settings that detects changes in the retina, allowing patients and their physicians to more routinely track treatment efficacy and ocular side effects. Early detection and treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and positively impact the research and care of other retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal pathology. While OCT is a widely-used modality for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for unsupervised use by patients at home. This includes a ruggedized and ergonomic design suited for those who suffer from low vision, low mobility, and other symptoms that make frequent trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly as often as prescribed by their doctor, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Complete development of a clinical-grade beta prototype that is suitable for use in clinical and home settings, 2) Develop a software pipeline for automated image analysis and report, and 3) Conduct a usability study in a cohort of AMD patients with varying degrees of vision loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20% and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776 million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, 11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain diabetic foot ulcers each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible, robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the prototype and scale up hardware production.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the development of disruptive technologies that use drones and artificial intelligence to monitor livestock.  Almost 75% of United States cattle are purchased by taking out bank loans, and lenders need to audit cattle inventories for collateral verification and appraisal purposes.  Additionally, more than 140,000 ranchers need to monitor their herds and detect cattle illnesses before infections spread.  The proposed technology will leverage aerial imaging and artificial intelligence to count cattle, characterize cattle weight, and diagnose cattle illnesses up to one week before clinical symptoms appear.  The ability to count herds regularly will enable ranchers to discover cattle rustling issues early and provide banks with a reliable way to perform collateral verification on ranches and feedlots, ensuring that banks can continue extending livestock operations the loans that they need to survive.  The ability to detect cattle illnesses early is expected to reduce cattle mortalities, the economic cost of antibiotic use, and possibly antibiotic resistance in humans.  Ultimately, the proposed technology that will be developed for monitoring cattle promises to also transform the way that land and marine wildlife, fisheries, and endangered species are monitored.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide cattlemen and bankers with an efficient way to detect and count cattle on pastures and ranches, estimate livestock weight, and identify ill cows before they spread infection further.  Despite daily monitoring of cattle herds, small discrepancies and losses are undiscoverable, and bovine illnesses are often left undetected until they spread, infecting more cattle and requiring large-scale administration of antibiotics.  Machine learning and image processing tools will be developed that (a) automatically analyze natural and thermal drone images to count cattle on multi-topography ranches and estimate livestock weight and (b) discriminate between healthy and ill cattle based on aerial radiometric imaging. The outcomes will be (1) a ready, drone-agnostic solution for counting cattle and estimating their weight and (2) a pilot-tested drone-and-software system for monitoring cattle health via radiometric imaging and notifying cattlemen about cows with suspected illness in real-time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide near-real time information of changes in the spatial extent (flood mapping) and flow of rivers (water resource management) to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Effective management of water resources and associated risks has become a major challenge for society. Floods are common disasters around the world and droughts lead to major disruptions to economies and a loss of life. This project will leverage artificial intelligence, and peta-bytes of satellite imagery to implement a physics guided data-intensive approach for advancing global hydrological modeling. The project will provide efficient and accurate imagery-derived observations of water dynamics in rivers at relatively low computational cost (compared with ground sensors) in a user-friendly web environment. This will be a significant step towards improving the modelling and forecasting of water resources around the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop advanced artificial intelligence techniques to track surface water changes in rivers across the globe using vast amounts of satellite imagery. While conventional artificial intelligence techniques are purely driven by data, the proposed technology incorporates known physical laws into these algorithms. This physics guided approach makes these techniques much more robust to atmospheric disturbances (clouds, shadows, haze, etc.), and enables synergistic use of imagery datasets at different resolutions which are two major issues with satellite imagery analysis. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty quantification techniques will enable domain experts to incorporate their local knowledge about river flows into the framework to refine results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a significant increase to the security of healthcare safe public-private blockchain protocols. The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development and adoption of next generation portable energy storage devices.  Lithium-ion batteries are the most common energy storage technology for a wide variety of applications. Most recently, they have been adopted by small to medium sized Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and electric vehicles (EV). The weight carrying capacity and flight/operating time and range of these UAS and EV are issues mainly dependent on battery components and materials.  With the proposed lithium-ion battery technology, high-capacity, lightweight, and advanced batteries may store significantly more energy without increasing their weight. The development and integration of the next generation battery technology may significantly increase the performance of battery powered vehicles and their adoption by society. This technology has the potential to have a drastic commercial impact in the UAS/drone industry; For example, with successful batteries, medicine, blood, and organs can be quickly delivered to remote locations on unmanned platforms. Utility workers may be able to identify pipeline leaks or transmission line damages in advance of an accident and packages may be delivered faster, with significantly less carbon footprint, along with myriad of other applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop high capacity, lightweight lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells with a novel carbon-based anode component. Existing LIBs still utilize graphite with additives as the primary anode material due to their ability to restore the charge and provide consistency in voltage. However, graphite's limited capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of long lasting, higher energy density (over 340 Wh/kg) LIBs. Graphite's internal structure limits sufficient lithium diffusion into interlayer spaces. This project offers a new class of higher energy density (over 500 Wh/kg) LIBs, with an innovative multilayer graphenic anode.  Replacing graphite with the multilayer graphenic anode offers a solution in overcoming the issue of the  limited capacity of the carbon anode. This patent-pending, commercially feasible, only carbon-based anode has the unique capability of an intense lithium (Li) intercalation within its networks. The large Li/electrolyte interface contributes enhanced charge-transfer kinetics, resulting in effective charge/discharge cycling throughout hundreds of cycles with over 1500 mAh/g specific capacity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to improve fruit and vegetable storage and dairy powder production in situations that currently require additives and carrier agents during the high-temperature processing techniques. The creation of novel, high-quality, shelf-stable food products is an important step toward increasing food system sustainability and accessibility.  The team seeks to increase shelf-stability, reducing reliance on the expensive and limited cold chain. This technology has potential applications for pharmaceutical drug preservation. Additionally, global water shortages have increased reliance on desalination technologies that are expensive and environmentally taxing. With the potential cost, scalability, and portability benefits of the proposed separation technology, there is further potential for use in water treatment.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to further develop a hybrid separation technology combining supercritical fluids and sonication to instantly separate a solute and solvent at operational temperatures of 15-55 °C, with inputs as low as 1% solids.  The technology results in products with particles sizes of <10um to >250um and varying crystallization without hardware changes. By creating a continuous separation effect using velocity (supersonic flow as the kinetic driving force for phase separation instead of heat), the technology overcomes the end-product quality limitations of traditional thermal drying techniques, and has the potential to scale with attractive unit economics,.  This method is significantly more energy efficient than existing methodologies. Specifically, the technology can produce pure fruit, vegetable, and dairy powders without preprocessing concentration steps, additives, carrier agents, or thermal treatment.  The method may also be used to develop drug formulations for aerosol delivery and/or enhanced bioavailability, streamline sugar manufacturing to create co-energy generation, and potentially offer cost effective compact desalination systems to make drinkable water. The Phase II research seeks to design, construct, and optimize a scalable pilot system through computational fluid dynamics modeling, custom fabrication, and analytical testing to validate the unit economics and end-product attributes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality and efficiency of bedside spinal access procedures by developing a needle guidance system that interfaces with existing ultrasound machines. Lumbar punctures (LPs) are performed to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as meningitis. The traditional LP technique requires practitioners to manually feel for spinal landmarks to form a mental image of the anatomy before blindly inserting the needle into the spine, aiming for a small target containing spinal fluid. This methodology can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming and is highly dependent on practitioner experience and patient body type. Up to 42% of procedures fail to access the target. Failed cases require radiological intervention, increasing the cost of care, lengthening patient stay, and exposing patients to radiation. Hospitals in the United States lose an estimated $2 billion annually due to inefficiencies and failures in LPs. The proposed needle guidance system will enable bedside spinal access procedures to be performed under real-time ultrasound imaging, significantly improving first-attempt success rates. The guidance technology can further be applied in other clinical segments, improving the quality of care across a variety of needle-based procedures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) Complete development of a needle guidance system designed to interface with existing ultrasound machines; and 2) Develop an AI-powered anatomy detection software feature for the guidance system. These combined objectives will generate a functional, intuitive, and accessible solution that minimizes barriers to adoption while maximizing clinical and operational value. The proposed research involves conducting an array of safety and reliability studies to investigate the performance of the guidance system under realistic conditions. In developing a robust anatomy detection software feature, a spinal ultrasound data set will be created from a variety of non-patient volunteers. The data will be analyzed, processed, and used to train a machine learning model for anatomy detection. It is anticipated that the results of this project will demonstrate a sufficiently safe and efficacious system that can consistently guide a needle to an intended target with an error of less than 3 millimeters. The anatomy detection feature is expected to perform with at least 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity in identifying five key spinal landmarks; this level of performance would significantly reduce the knowledge barrier to performing ultrasound-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to increase the quality of consumer products and services by scaling the data sharing economy. Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are “messy" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with “feature stores,” which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to unleash the potential of water as a thermal energy storage medium for building air conditioning. Today’s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns.  First, materials testing will be completed after a year’s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to close gaps in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) proficiency, improving participation and sustained achievement, particularly for historically underserved student populations. Learning science has validated that the mathematical sciences are processed experientially — through seeing, moving, doing, perceiving — but current educational solutions generally do not explore this learning modality.  This platform will utilize Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and advanced analytics to scale these best practice pedagogies for both students and teachers. The aim of this project is to actualize the vision of technology-assisted STEM learning and operationalize it across the US K-12 system to close long-standing barriers to access and proficiency at scale.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform offers a way to rapidly close significant learning gaps students are facing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate how multimodal and game-driven learning in IVR can be used to enhance math proficiencies and the ability to transfer mathematical knowledge across contexts.  Such abilities have so far eluded incumbent learning technologies and interventions for math. In particular, this research may culminate in an experiential solution for students to learn Algebra efficiently, effectively, and purposefully. Immersed in relevant real-world contexts, students will use tactile 3D tools, movement, and a research-based pedagogical framework to build lasting fluency with math concepts while solving high impact problems. The platform will leverage the latest advances in data analysis to personalize learning experiences based on individual behaviors, skills and goals. This solution provides teachers with real-time data on student thinking so they can closely monitor, identify, and support priority students while providing timely feedback during critical cognitive moments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce a fusion-based engine in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive. The ultimate system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy.  Since the system is small and has low radiation, it also has applications for manned space flight.  This new engine could enable more direct and shorter flights to other planets, which minimizes the exposure of astronauts to the radiation encountered in outer space.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue the companies research on using a harmonic well to produce fusion by particle kinetic energy, rather than general thermal energy. The proposed concept utilizes a new heat engine technique that always maintains the plasma distribution function in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the proposed fusion system, a plasma is created in a specially designed harmonic well and then induced to form into two counter-oscillating spinning rings. When the two rings collide at the center of the well, the particle velocities are high enough to cause fusion.   This phase of the project will increase the energetics of the device. The project will move up to deuterium, a fuel which is twice as heavy as hydrogen (the current fuel) and has a much larger cross-section for fusion. The proposed approach is expected to make the harmonic well sufficiently energetic to produce deuterium-on-deuterium fusion by increasing the natural oscillation frequency of the well to give ion collision speeds of about one million meters per second. The project expects to be able to detect the neutrons produced by the fusion, demonstrating aneutronic fusion.

    \ of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) project includes\
    \ reducing the US dependence on foreign-sourced materials for the production and\
    \ supply of battery systems. There are increased concerns about the shortage of\
    \ materials for lithium ion batteries (LIB) as the number of electric vehicles\
    \ increases.  Lithium Sulfur (Li-S) batteries use sulfur which is more readily\

    \ the use of sulfuric acid or other more harmful chemicals, which allows them\
    \ to be disposed of easily or recycled. This project will advance knowledge in\
    \ addressing challenges to the development of practical and commercially viable\
    \ (Li-S) batteries. The Global Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) Battery Market was valued\
    \ at $696 Million in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $6,686 Million by 2028,\
    \ with a CAGR of 29.6% during the forecast period. Li-S batteries are mainly used\
    \ in aviation, automotive, electronic device, and power & energy sector due to\
    \ the growing demand for environmentally friendly energy with higher energy density\
    \ than other battery types. Li-S technology has potential to enhance safer battery\
    \ manufacturing in the US.\n\n\nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to address\
    \ important technical challenges against the development of practical Li-S batteries.\
    \ These challenges include limited cycle life, high self-discharge rates and over-heating\
    \ at end of charge. These are thought to be caused by the shuttle, where cathode\
    \ species diffuse to the anode and react directly with the metallic lithium. A\
    \ system approach will be employed to develop practical high performance Li-S\
    \ Cells by focusing on: Performance (high energy density, large temperature range,\
    \ and considerable cycle life); safety; and manufacturability. The project combines\
    \ experimental and electrochemical modeling approaches to achieve a Li-S cell\
    \ with 400-600 Wh/kg; ≥200 cycles; - 20oC to 60oC @ 1C. The project will use advanced\
    \ trilayer multifunctional separator and lithium metal anode to solve the problems\
    \ associated with the shuttling effect. Simulation tools will be used to study\
    \ and optimize the design and performance of the Li-S cells. The technical objectives\
    \ for Phase 2 include the design, fabrication and characterization of progressively\
    \ larger pouch cells (from 50 mAh to 500 mAh/1000 mAh). The development path will\
    \ focus on achieving high energy density Li-S cells first and increasing the temperature\
    \ range at a reasonable number of cycles.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is related to the underserved, emergent bilingual population in US school systems. In spite of their growing size (approximately 20 percent of the total US population), emergent bilinguals still do not have adequate support to succeed in academic settings and are often victims of a subtractive bilingualism process that favors the acquisition of English at the expense of the home language. The lack of adequate bilingual resources has led to a disproportionate misplacement of emergent bilinguals in special education as well as an increased drop-out rates in bilingual populations, in general, and Latino communities in particular. To address these problems, a recommendation system powered by machine-learning algorithms that will generate a personalized bundle of fun, bilingual literacy activities linked to a fully-automated bilingual assessment is proposed. The unique characteristic of this solution is that the personalized activities are generated automatically based on assessment results and activity performance. The goal of the activities is to develop the skills identified by the assessment as needing improvement, both in English and in the home language of the child.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the educational needs of the growing, school-age, emergent bilingual population (i.e. children in the school system whose home language is not English or only English), as well as the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic acumen for society as a whole. The main research objectives involve: a) designing game-like bilingual activities that can get the young child’s attention, b) developing age-appropriate and culturally-sensitive content for the bilingual activities, c) refining the speech recognizer to work well with children's speech in both Spanish and English, and d) implementing the latest trends in data-analysis and machine-learning technologies to develop a recommendation system that proposes personalized activities tailored to each child’s needs based on assessment results and activity performance. The research and development plan aims at developing an innovative product that stands out from existing solutions. The key differentiator features are: 1) its focus on bilingual children and its adaptability in accepting bilingual answers for the activities, 2) its capacity to help children develop speaking skills due to the integration of automatic measures of speech performance, and 3) its recommendation engine that suggests personalized bilingual activities for each student tailored to their specific needs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.  Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks, develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed decisions.

    The research and development activities include: (1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps. These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods, potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaska’s environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-makers.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is in development of fully-biodegradable disposable personal care products, particularly menstrual pads. In general, menstrual pads cannot be recycled or be composted by municipal facilities after use because of issues with the biodegradable hot-melt adhesives to construct and position them. Biodegradation may be the best way to reduce the environmental impact associated with them, particularly in geographies where municipal solid waste facilities are underdeveloped.  Ultimately, non-toxic, safe and effective disposable menstrual pads could improve quality of life for menstruating women and the environment, and provide a new commercial opportunity for producers in the US and around the globe.

    The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of synthesizing a combination of biodegradable thermoplastics and biological additives that will create a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). This PSA must performs well in commercial hot glue application machinery as well as in the intended products, completely and safely degrade within six months of use, and is commercially viable at scale. These parameters have yet to be met by biological-based adhesives. The research approach is as follows: First, develop and synthesize PSAs using a biological base polymer and biological-based biodegradable additives, including plasticizers, tackifiers, and compatibilizers to enhance the performance of the PSAs. Second, characterize PSAs based on established use and manufacturing requirements and optimize the composition to ensure the requirements are met. Third, test PSA compositions for degradation, including length of time required for complete biodegradation under landfill, soil, and water conditions, including marine environments.  Identify intermediate chemical molecules and structures that form as a result of the biodegradation process, determine their potential hazards on both the environment and the health of biological organisms.  This project will develop a biodegradable PSA that will meet manufacturing and performance standards in menstrual pads and show that the PSA can be fully biodegradable in less than six months under non-specialized environmental conditions, without the need of mechanochemical or photo degradation processes.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants, including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over 85%.

    The proposed project turns supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling. Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new markets, such as wastewater treatment.  Recovery of compression energy during SCWO has been demonstrated previously.  This project's goals are to further optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours between major services.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in teaching K-12 and college students STEM concepts in the fun-filled context of designing, building, and programming machines and robots and preparing them for the future technology-driven jobs. This project seeks to make robotics education affordable, equitable, and inclusive for students at all grade levels. By taking a multi-disciplinary and cross-curricula approach, the product developed through this project engages students, especially women and minorities from diverse backgrounds, effectively in STEM disciplines and helps them make suitable career choices. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce and help fill the 2.5 million STEM jobs that are vacant according to the current US Department of Labor Statistics. The technological innovations emerging from this project would result in a computational tool for synthesis of robot motions, which can be used broadly in industrial automation and invention of machines and robots. The proposed design-driven educational robotics product has the potential to improve engagement with science and technology and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to bring together rigid body kinematics, machine learning, and engineering design to create a new product for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools, freshman college programs, and STEM camps. The leading commercially available educational robotic systems emphasize 1) instruction-driven prototyping of robot structures using many specialized parts, and 2) programming them without providing any intuition behind the design process or guidance to creating mechanism design concepts for the realization of the motion of the robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, new science standards, and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This product would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. If successful, this project would result in a state-of-the-art motion design software, a novel hardware kit, and standards-aligned curriculum and learning resources for schools and colleges. The software based on the machine learning in mechanism design research will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide students necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    \ Phase II project is based upon establishing a consistent, reliable source of\
    \ high-quality hollow metal nanoparticles, thus enabling their commercial adoption\
    \ in applications where they markedly outperform their conventional counterparts.\
    \ One such application is point-of-use testing: by switching to hollow metal nanoparticles,\
    \ lateral flow assays will reach higher levels of sensitivity and lower limits\
    \ of detection, improving field testing for environmental contamination; detection\
    \ of toxins and pathogens in agriculture; and early disease identification in\
    \ clinical and veterinary care. Integration into rapid antibody and antigen tests\
    \ for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19 should prove particularly impactful,\
    \ as the resulting higher sensitivity would reduce the occurrence of false negative\
    \ results, thereby improving the performance (and public perception) of rapid\
    \ testing. Critically, it would also improve baseline testing availability for\
    \ rural and under-served populations who do not have access to PCR-equipped clinical\
    \ laboratories. They can be applied to many other industries as well. \n\nThis\
    \ Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will advance the state of\
    \ the art of continuous flow synthesis of plasmonic nanomaterials. Nanoparticle\
    \ synthesis is a highly sensitive process, and obtaining high quality samples\
    \ of advanced architectures has previously required labor-intensive, small-batch\
    \ processes incompatible with large-scale production. Simply scaling traditional\
    \ batch techniques has led to product with poor quality and prohibitive costs.\
    \ This project advances a prototype reactor that has demonstrated high-throughput\
    \ production of hollow plasmonic nanoparticles with control over size and color,\
    \ while maintaining structural uniformity (<15% CV). Importantly, it reduced the\
    \ cost of labor per liter of product by 950% from that of small batch synthesis.\
    \ The proposed project will increase fidelity, further scale production volume,\
    \ post-process and stabilize the final product, and benchmark its optical performance.\
    \ The resulting production-scale reactor will have the capacity necessary to supply\
    \ LFA manufacturers with ready-to-use, advanced color labels. It will enable new\

    \ of high performance plasmonic nanostructures with well-controlled physical properties.\
    \  The manufacture of hollow metal nanoparticles for point-of-use testing applications\
    \ will also pave the way for their expansion into other industries that would\
    \ also benefit from their advantageous optical and photothermal plasmonic properties,\
    \ such as photocatalysis, water purification, and phototherapeutics.\n\nThis award\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.

    The proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    \ Phase II project is to address health concerns associated with peanut allergies.\
    \ Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for\
    \ those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut\
    \ allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising\
    \ incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free\
    \ peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen\
    \ the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits:\
    \ (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives\
    \ by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut,\
    \ (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their\
    \ families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting\
    \ food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination.\
    \ \n \nThe proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free\
    \ peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing\
    \ tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\
    \ and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after\
    \ contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound\
    \ to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut\
    \ allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for\
    \ the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h\
    \ 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens.\
    \ The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara\
    \ h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut\
    \ plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble\
    \ lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize\
    \ the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative\
    \ development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions. If the resulting\
    \ plants demonstrate tolerance to the gene deletions, the allergen-free peanut\
    \ will be very significant in protecting the peanut sensitive populations and\
    \ promoting peanut sales.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has\

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a universal protein sample preparation\
    \ kit that extracts proteins from any biological sample, removes contaminants,\
    \ and prepares them for downstream analytical methods with higher yields and deeper\
    \ coverage than currently available technology.  Proteins are the molecular machines\
    \ of the cell that do all the work required to keep humans healthy, and incorporation\
    \ of protein analysis is becoming increasingly important for developing a clear\
    \ understanding of integrated biological systems, realizing the promise of precision\
    \ medicine, and rapid drug discovery. Sample preparation is the first step in\
    \ any protein-based project workflow and without a high-yield, fast, and reproducible\
    \ way to prepare samples, downstream analyses are difficult to interpret and highly\
    \ variable, leading to long project times and wasted resources.  The proposed\
    \ innovation improves sample yields, reproducibility, and speed, accelerating\
    \ research seeking to discover new therapies and diagnostics and improving cost-effectiveness.\
    \  It will also purify other important biomolecules from the same sample, such\
    \ as DNA, RNA, and metabolites, allowing researchers to obtain more information\
    \ from each sample, prepare multiple samples in the time it takes to prepare one,\
    \ and improve reproducibility by using the same starting material. \n\nThe proposed\
    \ project will utilize reversible protein tagging chemistry to create a one-tube\
    \ workflow for the capture, wash, and elution of protein samples for analysis.\
    \  Because this novel reversible protein tagging chemistry is not dependent on\
    \ a catalyst, does not produce byproducts, and is completely biorthogonal, it\
    \ has the potential to work universally with all types of buffer systems, including\
    \ harsh denaturants and detergents commonly used for cell lysis and protein solubilization.\
    \  This proposed work will optimize the utilization of this sample preparation\
    \ technology in the most used buffer systems, model organisms, and will show superior\
    \ yields in the preparation of diagnostic sample types such as blood, urine, and\
    \ cerebrospinal fluid.  Additionally, because our reversible protein tag does\
    \ not cross react with other biomolecules, we will show that we can also use this\
    \ technology to purify other important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites.\
    \  The technology developed in this project will revolutionize how researchers\
    \ prepare samples for analysis, providing them with modular tools that can purify\
    \ any biomolecules they need from the same starting sample, reducing time, improving\
    \ yields, and decreasing batch to batch variability by comparing within the same\
    \ starting sample.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail items moving in and out of buildings.  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  This project will address these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The effort is focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase its effectiveness.  If successful, the project will address critical public health and safety challenges.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset.  No commercially viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One challenge is the detection of liquid or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame – such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device.  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a novel non-toxic antifoulant that keeps the hulls of vessels clear of biofouling without the environmental harm imposed by today's current antifoulant products.  Biofouling is the accumulation of algae, barnacles, and other marine organisms on underwater surfaces such as the hulls of ships and boats.  A ship with a biofouled hull experiences drag, which slows it down and drives up fuel consumption by as much as 40%.  For the global shipping industry, this increase imposes an annual fuel cost penalty of $36 billion. Moreover, the excess fuel consumption due to biofouling adds 386 million tons of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.  Over 90% of antifoulants in the market today contain copper, a toxic biocide harmful to the marine ecosystem.  This project will develop a competitive antifoulant which avoids harmful environmental impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project develops a first-of-its-kind antifouling marine coating that is high-performing and safe for use in aquatic ecosystems.  This antifouling coating contains no biocides but delivers antifouling performance matching that of the market leading copper coatings. The novel coating consists of a hydrophilic polymeric material that is naturally antifouling.  It prevents biofouling by creating a liquid barrier around a surface which masks the surface from fouling marine organisms. While other hydrophilic coatings are notoriously unstable in aqueous environments, this innovation includes a method of application that helps to greatly increase the coating's stability and durability. The objectives of this Phase II project are to tune the formulation of the novel coating to meet marine end user performance requirements and regulatory benchmarks and to demonstrate small-batch production capabilities.  The outcome of this work will be a rigorously tested, ready high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable advanced 3D printing materials to solve challenges in emerging electronic devices, transportation technologies, heating and cooling system for buildings, and in thermal management in manufacturing processes. Overheating is a major challenge as electrical devices continue to grow more compact and energy dense. Heat exchangers manufactured through traditional methods are often expensive and energy intensive to fabricate and suffer from corrosion, limited performance, and high maintenance costs. Traditional mold tools machined from metals are often expensive, require long lead times, and have limited design freedom. To address these challenges, this project will develop a platform of novel high thermal conductivity composite materials that can be used to 3D print parts that enhance electronics cooling and performance while also reducing the product weight and cost, can improve heat exchanger performance while also reducing corrosion, fouling and associated maintenance, and can also be used to 3D print low cost and high-performance molds with low-cost capital and short lead times. The project will result in an advanced materials platform for engineers to create parts with metal-like thermal conductivity, but with the speed, low cost, and ultimate design freedom of printing plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develops 3D printable, plastic composite materials with 500x higher thermal conductivity than standard plastics. The unique materials incorporate continuous wires and fibers in 3D printing filaments to achieve thermal conductivity values not possible in traditionally manufactured composite parts.  The polymer composite shell and wire/fiber core can be tailored to offer high strength, high temperature stability, and even joule heating. These materials are printed directly on commercially available and low-cost Independent Dual Extrusion (IDEX) 3D printers using a modified hardware and software platform. Printing and filament production will be accomplished through the following five objectives: 1) finalize filament formulations for the desired material properties, 2) establish a pilot scale filament manufacturing line to demonstrate production scalability, 3) complete minor 3D printer hardware modifications to accommodate filament printing, 4) develop software to print and optimize parts for desired properties, and 5) print application examples and validate product performance with commercially relevant demonstrations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve personnel safety from flammable gas leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential facilities. Additionally, the technology contributes to combating climate change by tackling one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.  The technology enables the mitigation of methane and refrigerant leaks that constitutes a significant market opportunity in the oil, gas and HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) markets. The innovation may solve important technical bottlenecks that have prevented widespread adoption of pervasive gas sensing in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As an enabling system, it may be utilized in a variety of other applications area such as the detection of explosives, narcotics, chemical weapons, indoor air quality monitoring, and diagnosis of disease via breath analysis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a gas sensor with an unparalleled combination of size, power, and cost while offering high detection performance. The proposed architecture fabricates high-frequency bulk acoustic resonators directly on the backend of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) integrated circuit chips which permits low-cost, mass-production and improved noise characteristics of the sensors. The direct co-integration also allows the fabrication of a receptor array to obtain responses from multiple target analytes that can be used to classify materials and for real-time calibration against environmental confounders. The objective of this project is the development of a single-chip gas sensor based on co-integrated piezoelectric materials. This effort will consist of the design, fabrication and characterization of integrated resonator arrays onto silicon circuits; integration of the chips with receptor materials, allowing selective adsorption of target gas molecules; and testing to assess the gas sensing performance.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the optics and lenses used in near infrared 3D imaging.  Glass lenses, which have excellent transmittance and thermal properties, are used in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and rangefinders for distances beyond a few tens of meters.  Polymer lenses, which are moldable and lower cost, are typically used in consumer-mobile 3D cameras and emerging automotive LiDAR systems.  The refractive indices of these lenses limit the numerical aperture and require longer-than-desired lens barrels.  The proposed polymeric chalcogenide lenses combine infrared transmittance, index, and thermal properties with the cost and moldability of optical polymers.  The innovation enables the molding of freeform polymer lenses with increased numerical aperture and reduced barrel lengths.  These properties make possible more compact, lighter, and lower cost 3D imagers.  With these advantages, rangefinders can be more easily carried and scan faster and smartphone cameras can have wider viewing angles.  Additionally, LiDAR systems can image more accurately around a vehicle and improve both driver and pedestrian safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance sulfur polymer chemistry and materials processing for the development of a new class of near infrared (NIR) optical components.  Innovative chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering has led to the development of a new class of optical polymers with the potential for imaging applications in the NIR.  As a result of extensive optical and mechanical characterization, including the determination of the optical constants over the full infrared spectrum, measurement of mechanical properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, measurement of thermo-optic coefficients, and determination of stress-optic coefficients, the materials will now be developed and integrated for product applications with innovative optical designs based on material's unique property set.  Freeform optical design concepts will be used which, to date, have not often been used in infrared imaging.  Such designs may lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for infrared imaging applications, further leveraging the advantages of the material's transmission spectrum, incorporating absorption, bulk scattering and surface scattering, and surface scattering contributions.

    \ create a new way to deliver certain fluids, such as intravenous drugs.  Small\
    \ dose dispensing ($35.63 billion annual global market) is a vital activity across\
    \ many different industries including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer\
    \ products (e.g. flavors & fragrances). Firms in these sectors are creating highly\
    \ valuable concentrated liquids and need to deliver extremely small volumes in\

    \ the safety of their customers and integrity of their product. Current dispensing\
    \ technologies create a bottleneck in the manufacturing process by inhibiting\

    \ in throughput, 75% footprint reduction, and 95% reduction in cost without compromising\
    \ accuracy or precision. These properties directly meet the needs in several industry\
    \ segments such as pharmaceutical dispensing, scientific research, and manufacturing.\
    \ \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to advance a method of elastic\
    \ filament velocimetry (EFV), which utilizes a strain-based sensor to measure\
    \ the velocity of fluid passing over a free-standing, electrically-conductive\
    \ nanoscale ribbon. Drag from the passing flow deflects the nanoribbon and induces\
    \ an axial strain and a change in the resistance that is directly related to flow.\
    \ The small dimensions of the sensing element result in viscously-dominated drag\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help patients with cardiorespiratory conditions, including sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia. The project will develop a wearable sensor platform to simultaneously diagnose and monitor conditions. Multiple physiological measurements are collected by a comfortable, wireless sensor patch, resulting in a convenient remote monitoring clinical framework. Interfacing sensor data with an efficient cloud-based provider portal and automated algorithms will enable rapid screening of the 24 million undiagnosed sleep apnea patients in the United States. The proposed innovation will also provide insight into the practical clinical benefits and efficiencies to be gained by bundling multiple comorbid or otherwise related diagnostic pathways into a single workflow, such as reducing time to treatment for comorbid atrial fibrillation. This remote monitoring bundle concept represents the only all-in-one device capable of servicing multiple highly pervasive health challenges in a method unobtrusive and user-friendly for both the patient and the provider - particularly for telemedicine applications made more urgent by the global pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a simple, accurate, cloud-connected wearable patch and collect clinical comparison data to develop automated, low-power algorithms to simultaneously detect sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, and cardiac arrhythmias. The project integrates materials science, mechanical engineering, and signal processing approaches to detect critical physiological signals from the torso, including oxygen saturation and several hemodynamic metrics. The project will also conduct studies that offer early insights into the clinical benefits of bundled workflows across cardiac and sleep medicine specialties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve drone control. Current controllers are effective in specific environments but perform poorly in environments and flight conditions such as turbulence, thereby narrowing the scope in which drones can be used.  This project will advance a plug-and-play solution in which users can focus on higher-level tasks specific to their use case, like obstacle avoidance and route planning. This new controller has broad applications in both commercial and military settings: it enables stable flight across a wide array of environments, expands the flight envelope in turbulent conditions, and allows for longer missions due to increased control efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of drone control in turbulence through the development of a reinforcement learning-based flight controller. The project will enlarge the design envelope for quadcopters as well as provide a system and environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to other control problems. Contemporary systems rely on Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controllers as an essential part of stable flight. These PID controllers rely on holistically tuned, static functions to convert maneuvering commands into voltage changes across drone motors to meet the rotor’s targeted rotation speed. In lieu of statically defined PID equations, this novel controller uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a subset of machine learning where an agent is trained to select actions that maximize a reward across an environment. This technique has led to greater-than-human performance across a variety of different control and game theory tasks, but little is known about how these techniques fare when replacing PID control systems. The primary advantage the development of a reinforcement learning controller would have over simpler PID controllers is the ability for the user to view drone control at a higher level of abstraction, thus mitigating the need to focus on the minutiae of flight control for complex missions.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include the ability to enhance the security and trust of critical infrastructure networks for applications including defense, electric grids, health care, and emerging autonomous systems (i.e., self-driving vehicles and robotics), as many of these systems are mission- and life-critical. The proposed innovation will allow distributed and autonomous systems the ability to make decisions based on highly trusted data sources. More importantly, the innovation addresses an immediate customer need to stop data breaches and prevent unauthorized activity on networks under flaky and uncertain conditions. The proposed innovation will enhance the practical applications of distributed computing fault tolerance and consensus mechanisms by applying them to real-world critical infrastructure networks. Mission-critical systems data are constantly under attack by adversaries at the rate of a billion times per year. For mission-critical systems, compromised data is a serious problem including huge economic losses, potential for mission failures, and in some situations, life-critical consequences. Protecting that data/information is one of the biggest market opportunities of this decade and the proposed work addresses the concerns of information assurance directly.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance an innovation that solves the complex problem of maintaining data integrity for mission-critical data within critical infrastructure networks.  The proposed innovation simplifies the extremely complex science of consensus and fault tolerance in distributed systems by combining flexible deployment of state-of-the-art Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT)consensus algorithms with the proposed novel file system innovation, creating highly useful solution to protect data integrity before it can be compromised under varying network operating conditions including asynchronous network conditions (byzantine and crash fault scenarios, ability to retain all transactions, provide liveness guarantees, maintain local node state integrity, and maintain data ordering and timestamps). The proposed file system solution is designed to be an easy to deploy software platform that keeps data safe, tamper-resistant, verifiable, and trusted over the system’s life cycle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the enablement of verifiable and confidential computing through research and development that improves the performance and cost of the underlying cryptographic computations. Digital services play a foundational role in varied sectors including communication, education, banking, and others. Without cryptography these services would be impossible to conduct online in a secure and private manner. However, many new and more powerful cryptographic techniques remain out of reach due to their computationally expensive nature. Reducing the cost of these operations enables not just secure communication, but also verifiable and confidential computation, of rapidly growing interest to both the enterprise and government segments for use cases such as privacy-preserving machine learning. The market for verifiable and confidential computing solutions is expected to grow to over one billion dollars in the next five years.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and develop a high performance cloud-based system for verifiable and confidential computing. Currently many verifiable and confidential computing techniques can not be brought into production due to their computationally expensive nature. This project performs algorithmic research, hardware design, and software development, that will improve the performance and cost of these operations. In particular, this project optimizes cryptographic algorithms to make them more amenable to GPU-based processing, optimize the software implementation of those algorithms to target GPU architectures, devise methods for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and develop a scale-out architecture that dynamically scales capacity as the complexity of uses and number of users grow. With the appropriate design, the project expects to develop a system with over an order of magnitude or more performance than existing designs. Furthermore, by creating a ‘cloud-based’ infrastructure, these resources can be made available to developers around the world, with low latency and low cost. The expected improvements in performance, cost, and access will enable new use cases that have previously been impractical.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and networking.  Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers.  The proposed project enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum dot based multiwavelength laser sources.  Multiwavelength lasers with adequate output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion.  The designs and materials platform developed in this project address these challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the widespread adoption of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) by developing and commercializing a decentralized control and optimization platform capable of aggregating and managing millions of independent energy assets connected across the U.S. electric grid. The resulting end-to-end solution will enable private and public project developers, as well as utilities to quickly commission and cost effectively operate DER systems composed of solar arrays, batteries, generators, fuel cells and many other kinds of energy assets in residential, commercial, and industrial sites with complete confidence on the reliability, seamless grid integration, and economic performance of the systems. By making it that much easier and cheaper to own, integrate, and operate clean energy equipment, the resulting solution will transform the energy industry from the ground up, using DERs as the pillars of a new clean, resilient, and equitable grid.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will drastically simplify the way distributed energy resources (DER) systems are commissioned, aggregated, and operated. Such deployments are complex due to an endemic lack of standardization, the sheer number of key variables to control and optimize, and the lack of modularity in conventional approaches. Properly coordinating them as they continue to rapidly increase in number on the grid requires a decentralized approach that puts the decision-making at the DER level.  The project consists of two stages: (1) A development phase, where the algorithms will be integrated into a best-in-class solution, which will include all the necessary end-user facing tools, cloud infrastructure, and edge devices to enable full automation of deployments and satisfy technical requirements of customers in the mainstream market; and (2) a demonstration phase, where the resulting solution will be used at two different sites and benchmarked against critical use cases to validate its benefits and leverage the results to scale up market penetration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a sensor system for cell-based manufacturing of such products as biologic therapies, food ingredients, and bio-based materials. These sensors will overcome current limitations for tracking critical cell growth data, which requires manual sampling with slow turnaround times.  This system will enable better predictive growth models for improved production process development and will lead to better decision-making on cell type and culture conditions to produce biologic material. Better performance at this stage leads to potentially significant savings during the manufacturing lifetime of the drug.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a wireless sensor system to address the need of continuously monitoring viable cell density during biomanufacturing. Many industries use cells for production, but the initial focus is upstream development of cell therapies and biologics. Central to this development is tracking the growth of cells in a variety of small-scale, single-use bioreactors to determine key event points for feed and harvest. Current methods rely on infrequent sampling and off-line counting due to the volume required, risk of contamination, and cost. The central research objective is to develop methods for standardized sensor and reader fabrication and quality testing for calibration studies in commercially-relevant environments and systems.  The proposed project will develop: 1) sensor stickers that are applied to the exterior of culture vessels, 2) readers that interrogate the sensor, and 3) algorithms to convert the sensor signal to cell count and push notifications to operators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a Personalized Text Simplification (PeTeS) technology to be used as a Computer Assisted Tool for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. Several automatic text simplification tools are available in the market. Unfortunately, the existing tools are one-size-fits-all solutions offering no personalization and not supporting the teacher’s instructional goals. The innovation of PeTeS is in the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification customizing texts for each student, enabling him/her to understand the curriculum and improve vocabulary knowledge at the same time. PeTeS will be compatible with both independent use by students and teacher-driven data-driven instruction. PeTeS will be usable both in class and in remote education settings, which is a new critical demand in our schools caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this Phase II Project is to fully develop the PeTeS product and evaluate its effectiveness in classroom and remote education settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project based on this SBIR sensor solution, with its high quality and low cost, will enable the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) industry to accelerate the progress to greater functionality of assisted driving, ultimately reaching full autonomy. The subject focal plane array (FPAS) chips may reduce the current US 36,560 annual vehicles deaths (the leading cause of death for those 1-54 years old) as well as reduce the 4.4 million injuries requiring medical attention and the $ 871 billion in damages and health costs. Additionally, improved assisted driving will enhance the mobility of seniors/disabled. Finally, the technology may reduce the societal carbon footprint by reducing congestion as a result of more fuel-efficient acceleration and braking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve the current ADAS sensor suite to increase safety. Current ADAS systems require many different sensor technologies to be implemented simultaneously. These sensors are insufficient to achieve higher levels of autonomy limiting the vehicle’s used in poor conditions. The proposed sensor solution will function in low light and harsh weather conditions with high performance. The added sensor functionalities will reduce the processor bandwidth required to integrate and analyze sensor data and detect road hazards, increasing the accuracy of the system. Overall, this improvement in performance may increase the overall safety in ADAS vehicles. An evaluation system will be developed to characterize the sensor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a robotic solution to automate a dangerous and repetitive rebar tying task in construction. Rebar tying is performed by “rodbusters”, 88% of whom reported that they suffered some form of musculoskeleton disorder during their career. Removing the repetitive bending over and tying actions can have significant impacts on the quality life of the workers who commonly suffer from carpal tunnel complications and back injuries. The market for rebar tying services solely for bridge decks in the US is valued at over $370 million across the next ten years. The general construction market is estimated to spend at least $1.3 billion annually for rebar tying. A quality transportation infrastructure has direct impacts on national defense readiness, economic competitiveness, disaster response, exchange of goods, and standards of living. However, at present, the US has a growing backlog of bridges deemed deficient. A successful Phase II project may play a key role in addressing the infrastructure maintenance backlog and allowing a key foundation of the national economic engine to function properly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate multiple robots to perform automated rebar tying. Many construction projects have thousands of rebar intersections that need to be tied; A system to detect these intersections is proposed. Various algorithms for detecting rebar will be improved and integrated to build a semi-automated rebar map building software. The research project will build an aircraft configuration and develop various computer vision and controls algorithms to demonstrate that a drone can fly over placed rebar, identify the intersections to tie, land on top of them and tie the rebar together. A small swarm of the customized drone prototypes will be built for demonstration. Speed in executing the job is critical for most construction projects implying that each intersection has to be tied in a matter of seconds for viable adoption of the proposed technology. The success of this project may result in the first commercially-viable swarm of mobile manipulation robots for unstructured environments.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project addresses the monitoring needs via wastewater-based epidemiology of current and emerging viruses that pose high risks to public health. With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic situation and the recent emergence of the coronavirus variants, one common concern is that the virus variants are more contagious than their predecessors, and will likely spread quickly within communities without early detection and warning. Other concerns are that future mutations may not be covered by existing vaccines, in which case early monitoring through high resolution wastewater-based epidemiology will become one of the only effective means of providing early alerts of the presence of such mutated virus variants within local communities. With a wide adaptation of the proposed instrumentation by municipalities, large and small communities such as college campuses and senior care facilities, the project enables the early detection and monitoring of the current coronavirus and its variants during the pandemic. The technology can also be extended to other emerging viruses with risks of community spread in the years to follow, not only in wastewater but also in widespread environmental and recreational water quality monitoring.

    The proposed project is a highly-optimized reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach for in-situ sampling and analysis, and the realization of a corresponding instrumentation platform that is applicable to the early detection and monitoring of different viruses, including the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and other emerging viruses. The proposed technology aims to reduce the time-to-result compared to current wastewater-based epidemiology approaches while minimizing cost and logistics.  The effort will include the testing of several protocols that are amendable to adaption for automated in-situ SARS-CoV-2 measurement, followed by the selection and optimization of the most suitable one. The protocols will be subsequently tested and validated using spiked samples, along with appropriate positive and negative controls. The approach will implement, for the first time in an automated device, the latest advances in molecular biology protocols, such as extraction-free single-step RT-qPCR. The project strives to achieve the first in-situ RT-qPCR available, with the potential to completely revolutionize the fields of wastewater-based epidemiology, general environmental testing and source tracking.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve care for pulmonary conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This disease affects 30 million Americans, kills more than 150,000 a year and is the third leading cause of U.S. deaths. COPD costs Americans nearly $72 billion a year, half of which is spent on ER visits and hospital stays resulting from respiratory crises. Hospitalized COPD patients have reduced quality of life, more rapid lung disease progression, and a 50% increase in mortality in the subsequent two years. Currently, ongoing monitoring of COPD lung deterioration relies largely on patient-reported symptoms and inadequate tools (65-70% accurate). As a result, half of COPD deterioration remains undetected. The proposed technology facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of COPD attacks by continuous remote tracking of lung function, thereby preventing unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. This device improves care for long-term conditions like COPD or asthma, but also those with relatively quick onset, such as COVID-19.

    The proposed project advances translation of a device using acoustic resonance to measure lung air volume. The project develops an expanded data set for analysis and deployment at scale. The project further incorporates advanced classification models into the analysis workflow to track and predict deteriorating lung function in a cloud-computing environment. The project will also develop a version to run on a patient's mobile device to enable real-time feedback.

This project will prove the viability of an aerosolized pan-coronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. An inhalable therapeutic has a stronger commercial potential than the currently approved monoclonal antibodies which require intravenous delivery, and this drug will be more likely to retain potency against future variants. The COVID-19 virus is expected to persist in the human population, and novel variants thereof will continue to emerge. Therefore, this technology could be crucial in addressing these ongoing medical needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of an inhalable decoy receptor that would effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its endogenous cellular target and thus prevent infection of the host. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. The decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface. Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as expanded polystyrene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will be to address the customized needs of automotive applications with tailored high performance-low cost carbon fiber (HP-LCCF) products that are not currently commercially available. The broader impact of HP-LCCF technology is to enable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies to help mitigate the climate change linked emissions caused by fossil fuel powered vehicles.  Volume projections of HP-LCCF for this application are expected to ramp up significantly over the ten years.  After successful entry into the automotive market, the focus will be expanded to address needs in the wind energy market and with a tailored HP-LCCF product to enable longer blades for larger and more efficient wind turbines.  This technology will help spur global adoption of clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a process where heavy tow carbon fiber is subdivided using an electromechanical splitting process that can maintain an acceptable range of regular tow carbon fiber linear densities.  Subsequent tailoring trials will verify the capability to achieve and maintain the linear density targets provided by the automotive industry partners who will, in turn, perform downstream manufacturability trials.  Subdividing the heavy tows enables a seamless commercial entry into customers' downstream composite manufacturing processes without an inherent, potentially fatal heavy tow defect.  Such defects are typically non-uniform intra-band tension caused by the transverse catenary forces across the tow band.  Achieving high band linear density and variable intra-band tension are significant barriers for the commercial adoption of heavy tow high performance, low cost carbon fibers (HP-LCCF).  The process developed here may eliminate such issues and achieve commercially relevant HP-LCCF.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However, operating in today’s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application.  This project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively.  The technology represents a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete colonoscopies.  The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective, manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure realm.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    \ $3.5 billion by 2028. Current treatments for scoliosis include bracing and/or\
    \ spinal surgery. Patients are often treated with a rigid thoracic scoliosis brace\
    \ that does not typically provide curve correction. Compliance with wearing the\
    \ brace can be challenging. The proposed technology is an intelligent, active\
    \ brace that applies corrective forces to the spine via a dynamic, adjustable\
    \ platform and reports compliance through its sensors. This personalized system\
    \ may improve clinical outcomes at reduced cost. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation\
    \ Research Phase II project seeks to advance the development of an innovative\
    \ scoliosis brace. The proposed system is designed to be comfortable to increase\
    \ wear compliance by patients.  The brace has a dynamic mechanism that can be\
    \ adjusted to provide continuous pressure, and will have Bluetooth-connected sensors\
    \ allowing parents and physicians to ensure treatment quality.  The new technology\
    \ will accommodate patient growth and curve correction while maintaining a precise\
    \ fit, and may  lessen the social stigma of wearing a brace. In this Phase II\
    \ proposal, functionality and durability of the smart pad and sensor system in\
    \ a clinical setting will be verified, feedback from end users (orthotists, spine\
    \ specialists, patients and families) on the mobile application and physician\
    \ dashboard will be collected, and the system economics and fabrication will be\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from improved financial resilience of hundreds of thousands of water-dependent businesses and municipalities currently threatened by hydrologic volatility and severely strained ecosystems. This SBIR research will enable the seamless integration of scientific and financial modeling for the water economy. The innovation lowers the costs and improves the performance of two climate risk mitigation investments: 1) Green Infrastructure (projects that emulate or protect nature in order to ensure clean water supply for commercial and public use); and 2) weather insurance contracts, which provide businesses and utilities with financial relief from droughts and floods that hamper their operations. With 50% of the global population projected to face water scarcity by 2050 (according to the UN), and $10B in economic value destroyed annually by floods, droughts, freezes in the US, these new approaches to risk mitigation are crucial to reducing water demand stresses through a free-market approach to water resource conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to eliminate technical barriers currently hindering seamless data and model integration for hydrology and finance. The Phase I project validated technical feasibility by demonstrating the utility of a semantic web technology to provide end-to-end modeling solutions for quantifying hydro-financial risk. Phase I established that the technology 1) greatly improves the interoperability between massive heterogeneous data sets and models for quantifying hydrologic-financial risk, and 2) enables data and models to be linked through a tamper-proof distributed network. The Phase II project builds on the technological foundation to deploy a production environment for running a suite of models encompassing ecosystem services, hydrology, and actuarial sciences. The project builds foundations for AI-enabled decision support tools. If successful, this research will enable significant reductions in the time and costs associated with modeling the financial value of investment in natural water infrastructure, generating comparisons between a wide range of water projects and financial structures seamlessly and without compromising scientific rigor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lower the geohazard risks for assets within critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and utilities. More specifically, the proposed technology will make measuring and detecting ground motion with satellite radar more practical in applications where the observed areas cover very long distances and traverse varying terrain and land types. The innovation seeks to demonstrate that the combined processing of multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations can improve the information collected and that the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data can be used to aid insight. The efficacy of space-based satellite radar interferometry in measuring shifts in spatially-sensitive structures such as buried pipelines, foundations, and rail track ballast will be demonstrated over very large areas and linear distances. The technology developed in this project may have a positive impact on the aforementioned sectors by enabling monitoring capabilities that are timelier and more cost-effective than traditional approaches. The geospatial technology may also enable asset operators to be more proactive when it comes to geohazard threats, lowering the frequency of fatal and environmentally-damaging failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the key shortcomings of space-based satellite radar interferometry as a means to monitor surface motion threats to critical infrastructure assets. While interferometric approaches for specific types of terrain have been well documented and validated, approaches that produce coherent ground motion results over very large areas with varying terrain and radar scattering mechanisms have not been successfully deployed. Furthermore, combining multiple interferometric observations together to decompose ground motion has received little research attention despite being an important step in translating the relative line-of-sight satellite observations into ground motion components relevant to asset monitoring. This research effort seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of using multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations and combining their interferometric results to create a more continuous view of ground motion over areas with varying degrees of vegetation. This project may also demonstrate that combining both small baseline subset and persistent scatter interferometric approaches can improve the density of resolved scatterers over areas where land type variations create a diverse range of scattering mechanisms. The team also seeks to  demonstrate the use and accuracy of GNSS data in the reference setting process as insights are translated into absolute motion components about the geodetic reference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to improve public health.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment (PPE), including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), have been critical to containing disease spread and protecting first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. Shortages of FFRs have led public health agencies to provide guidance in favor of FFR decontamination and re-use as a crisis capacity strategy. This project seeks to develop a cost-effective approach to support sterilization and re-use of personal protective equipment at the point-of-care. The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the high cost and poor safety of Lithium-ion batteries in new energy applications. Low-cost and safe batteries will improve economic viability for solar energy storage, which is critical to increasing renewables penetration to above 30% of total power generation. This project advances a battery material to provide lower cost, higher safety and improved cyclability compared to currently used materials. This can support new batteries in applications including electric vehicles, grid-tied and solar storage, and consumer power tools, among others.

    This SBIR project proposes a novel nanostructured LiMn2O4 cathode chemistry (ND-LMO) that offers ~30% lower $/kWh cost compared to incumbent nickel managanese cobalt oxides (NMC) materials. Furthermore, it will have iimproved performance parameters, such as cycle life, a safer heat generation profile, and a 10% greater amp-hour capacity between full state of charge and maximum depth of discharge. Many of these improvements stem from the “intercalation-pseudocapacitive” properties of finely nanostructured electrode materials. Technical challenges, such as inactive and deactivating surfaces, synthetic costs, and others, must be addressed for these systems to be commercially viable.  The project’s proposed composition and methods used can be applied to other material systems.

    \ the collapse of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.  These loads can\
    \ also destabilize geographical features such as water impoundments and hillsides.\
    \  Increasingly extreme climate impacts and aging infrastructure make these situations\

    \ the US, 45,000 are structurally deficient. Landslides result in $3.5 billion\
    \ in repair costs due to physical damage and result in 25 to 50 deaths annually.\
    \  Since small structural movements often precede damage and even catastrophic\
    \ failure, the ability to detect and monitor these motions at key locations and\
    \ deliver warnings to any user with a cell phone or computer is of great societal\
    \ benefit.  This project will lead to the development of a low cost, rapidly installed,\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an easy-to-use virtual reality (VR) toolkit to enable rapid development and deployment of educational VR experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the “backward design” approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve shellfish production at scale and in an environmentally sustainable fashion, using oyster farming as a launching pad.  Today, most oysters are farmed nearshore under ecological stress.  This project advances the culturing of microalgae using internal waste streams and those from other food industries. The focus of this project is to process one of the most abundant, sustainable, and freely available industrial food wastes, spent yeast from breweries, to facilitate algae production at scale onshore and indoors. Although currently used primarily by the food and chemical industries, the less costly algal product could also energize areas of food and feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, biomaterials, and bioremediation services.

    The proposed project will advance the use of off-the-shelf bioreactors and a novel substrate which, along with CO2, form plant tissue heterotrophically in the dark as leaves do photosynthetically in the presence of sunlight. The proposed substrate enables production at scale of the single-celled microalgae that comprise much of the nearshore bivalve diet.  The yeast is fermented with both agriculture-grade vitamins and plant-based commodities.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel genetic trait that allows plants to rapidly respond to attacking pathogens. Despite modern agricultural practices and chemistry improvements, almost 40% of all crop production is lost due to pests and pathogens each year; within the U.S. over 25% of soybean production is lost this way. These losses are even more severe in regions where pesticide application is prohibitively expensive for farmers.  This project develops a new technology for use in soybean and other oilseed crops to protect against plant disease.

    The proposed project will develop a broad-spectrum pathogen resistance trait.  While the first generation of transgenic trait technologies conferring herbicide tolerance and insecticidal traits have been readily established for oilseed production across North and South America, further development has faltered due to the complexity of these plant traits. Unfortunately, the proteins that provide the best tolerance to adverse environmental conditions also result in toxic side-effects when produced in healthy plants; consequently, the utility of developing these proteins is limited. Current methods for regulating expression of resistance proteins introduced into plants through genetic engineering are insufficient to regulate toxic proteins/compounds that may have side-effects in other environmental conditions. The proposed project will demonstrate an expression system that responds to signals, common to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, in the early and late stages of the plant immune response to release the production of anti-microbial proteins only in when needed, effectively eliminating the off-target side-effects. The project objectives are to 1) perform field and greenhouse trial of soybean with this technology to ascertain extent of pathogen resistance and yield effects in infected and healthy conditions; 2) optimize the technology for tissue specific (i.e., roots vs. leaves) use in soybean; 3) conduct greenhouse experiments to determine response to pathogen detection in canola, cotton, and potato as candidates for future field trials and commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need special probes or dyes to detect viruses.

    The proposed project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images from the common 96-well plate.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve agricultural operations with respect to infection.  Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.

    The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal’s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal’s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable plastic recycling process. In the United States less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the remainder are incinerated (15%) or placed in landfills (75%). Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.  This project develops a low-temperature system for high quality, high-value plastic products in closed-loop recycling.

    The proposed project will apply synthetic biology and related biotechnologies to identify, engineer, and optimize new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.  These enzymes will enable closed-loop plastic recycling in an economically viable, low temperature, low CO2 emission process.   The first objective is to sample plastic contaminated environments for naturally occurring enzymes that have evolved to depolymerize PE and PET synthetic polymers.  Candidate PE and PET enzymes will be engineered to accelerate their ability to efficiently target and cut complex PE and PET polymers under scalable process conditions.  Millions of enzyme variants will be constructed, tested, and analyzed using synthetic biology, high-throughput screening, and machine learning technologies.  A primary goal of this effort is to demonstrate a 10-fold increase in PE and PET depolymerization rates compared to naturally occurring plastic degradation proteins.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an oral delivery platform that can deliver various drugs to the gastrointestinal tract. The market for novel biologics and oral formulations of currently injectable biologics is increasing rapidly, as is the market for gene therapies, necessitating a versatile oral drug delivery platform. This platform would positively impact society by reducing the need for repeated injections. This system would improve ease of administration of injectables by improving oral availability and the transport to the intestinal cells, and subsequent secretion of the protein into the bloodstream. This would also allow for local delivery of therapeutics for intestinal diseases which currently are hampered by poor mucus penetration and represent a multibillion-dollar market. Successful translation of this technology would benefit pharmaceutical companies, patients, and payers by providing an oral delivery platform for a broad range of therapeutics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of improving systemic expression of a protein from the gastrointestinal tract following oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The role of digestive tract is to breakdown lipids and nucleic acids and it has therefore been very challenging to for gene delivery vehicles to survive and deliver cargo to the intestine. The project advances a new lipid nanoparticle system able to protect the genetic cargo to generate protein expression in intestinal cells later secreted into the bloodstream for systemic circulation. This process converts previously injected protein drugs into an easily administered oral drug. The research objectives are to screen and optimize several of the lipid components as well as the nucleic acid to improve secreted expression of a protein into the blood after oral delivery. This research will screen multiple formulations and cargos in vivo and measure serum protein levels after oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The anticipated technical results are that the level of secreted protein will improve 10x from the initial formulation, further increasing the scope of potential therapeutic targets for the oral lipid nanoparticle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of blood clotting and associated bleeding risks in neonatal and pediatric patients as well as vulnerable adult patients. Existing systems put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. Using only a single drop of blood, the proposed non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting for all patients and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by more than 3x. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $1.1 billion annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood. The basis of the technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation. Due to its non-contact feature and low sample volume requirement, this technology can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The goal of this project is to develop and test a system for fast, reliable, and easy-to-use drop-of-blood coagulation analysis under sterile conditions. This goal will be achieved by meeting four objectives: 1) develop the module for automatic sample deployment from standard blood collection tubes; 2) implement environmental control and sample containment (“acoustic cartridge”); 3) assemble prototype devices and develop the control software with improved workflow and a user-friendly interface; and 4) assess prototype reliability, standardize it for coagulation measurements, and conduct initial clinical testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable radiotherapies for metastatic cancer, estimated to account for 90% of the 600,000 cancer deaths in the US each year. Of the approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the US, nearly half are candidates for improved outcomes using some form of radiation-based therapy. Metastatic cancer, however, is generally not treated with radiotherapies due to the need for prior knowledge of the metastatic sites. The proposed project treats metastatic cancer by using the cancer cells themselves to help deliver the radiation. This technology may generate reliable efficacy of radiotherapy for the treatment of the most lethal forms of cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to advance radiotherapy that exploits cancer cells themselves as catalysts for therapeutic delivery. After systemic administration or local injection, the monomers are expected to diffuse through tissues and subsequently polymerize, immobilizing radionuclides in the extracellular space of cancer cells.  Non-cancerous cells will be minimally impacted, as soluble monomers will remain subject to diffusion and relatively rapid tissue clearance in the absence of cancer cell-derived catalysts. The chemistry at the core of the approach is an enzyme-triggered polymerization of native-like compounds under physiological conditions.  The final therapeutic compound features the polymerizable compound and covalently-conjugated radionuclide 131-I, a commonly used radiotherapy isotope.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to reduce the risk of complications and associated costs caused by standard bag valve mask (BVM) resuscitators, which are widely used in emergency resuscitation and airway management. In the United States, about 13.1 million BVMs are used annually. Medical providers frequently deliver unsafe manual ventilation with BVMs, regardless of the qualifications and experience of the provider. Dangerously high pressures, flow rates, and volumes of air flow can result in complications such as gastric insufflation, and less frequently, aspiration pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, barotrauma, volutrauma, and pneumothorax. There is an urgent need for an intervention to improve patient safety during manual ventilation with the resuscitator bag. This project involves the development of a safety device to be used with all standard BVMs on the market to regulate air flow and pressure. The device that will offer safe, affordable, and optimized ventilation while minimizing gastric insufflation.  The technology should have broad applications across the entire care continuum, but especially in emergency and battlefield medicine.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project seeks to further develop and optimize the BVM safety. This effort optimizes the haptic and auditory feedback the provider receives when using the device and optimizes the design and manufacturability of the product. In addition, biocompatibility studies and animal studies of the device in anesthetized pigs and in pigs undergoing cardiac arrest will provide data necessary for FDA clearance. This Phase II work will ensure that patients will receive the most optimal evidence-based treatment and will help establish the safety device as the standard of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves leveraging an innovative approach to deliver and monitor therapeutics more effectively. Real-time monitoring and tracking of immune and stem cell therapies is in its infancy. However, without the capability to precisely know where therapeutic cells localize, clinicians cannot assess safety, design optimal doses, or make clinical decisions related to therapeutic approaches. As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients. This proposal addresses a critical unmet need in the cell and gene therapy industry for rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic cells specifically to enable tracking in the body. The addressable market for preclinical and clinical cell tracking in clinical trials involving therapeutic cells in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $1.14 billion by 2024.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an innovative approach to intracellular delivery where mechanoporation or cell-squeezing is achieved simply by propelling cells, in the presence of exogeneous cargo, through a proprietary mechanoporation element that resides in a column designed to be processed in a centrifuge (spin column). End users will realize significant advantages over conventional and microfluidic approaches to intracellular delivery including: 1) Convenient spin column format; 2) Short cell processing times; 3) Ease of scale-up and multiplexing; 4) Applicability to numerous cell types; and 5) Compatibility with automated/robotic cell production systems including autologous cell production systems designed for clinical settings. Three objectives are proposed involving the generation of prototype spin columns and their use in optimizing aspects of element design to afford efficient intermolecular delivery of iron-based nanoparticles (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent) into T-cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells. The study will enable rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic and regenerative cells for in vivo tracking, empowering clinicians to make timely decisions with respect to treatment strategies, thus ensuring better clinical outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to revolutionize wildlife field work and research. Many wildlife professionals already understand the potential for using video as a sensor, but without commercial software to turn video into data, its vast benefits remain untapped. It is important to monitor environmental effects and the impact of urban growth; billions of dollars are spent annually understanding how construction and infrastructure projects are impacting species and habitats. The state of practice is to send technicians into the field for observation. In many situations using a camera system to monitoring for wildlife is not only safer and more effective, but also much less expensive that using human labor. This project will reduce the cost, decrease the timeline, and yield better outcomes for these important conservation efforts, allowing the existing biodiversity to be preserved.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a web-based software-as-a-service to detect, track, and classify wildlife from video and images captured in the field. There is substantial potential for video to provide better data to help wildlife biologists perform their work, but the main barrier is the complexity. Using video systems to study wildlife requires advanced multidisciplinary knowledge; appropriate camera technology, recording methods, advanced video processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.  There are currently no commercial-off-the-shelf hardware or software packages available for biologists. This project will reduce the complexity of obtaining quantitative data from video by developing commercial-off-the-shelf equipment packages, automated video processing software, and the advisory services needed to make this transformational technology more accessible to biologists in the field.  The video processing needed is the focus of the research; the goal is the create algorithms that automate object detection and classification from the video and allow non-experts to create an accurate machine learning classifier with minimal labeling requirements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several industries, the company’s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase.  The project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent flows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The software  will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows. The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions. The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy simulations of the vortical wake.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases, often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  An unbiased screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further enhanced binding to FcRn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to save water and energy across a wide spectrum of industrial and commercial applications (i.e. boilers, baking ovens, furnaces, proofers, HVAC systems) that emit wet exhaust into the environment. For example, the U.S. bread baking market segment alone may save over 50 million therms of energy and over 400 million gallons of water annually with the proposed technology.  The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon’s optimal performance at unconventional conditions. The non-linear phase-change heat transfer mechanisms will be defined and simulated, followed by a sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the channel geometry and thermosiphons array for subsequent prototype design and performance demonstration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make a new class of antibody-based immunotherapies that can be generally applicable to oncology patients. For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy using a novel and proprietary precision gene editing technology. The proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of gene editing by optimizing the precision of editing to correct the disease. This technology can be used to improve and even cure patients of genetic disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using a novel and proprietary CRISPR-Cas precision gene editing system. Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases. However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies. This project will develop an engineered anti-CRISPR (ErAcr) protein to eliminate unintended off-target editing. The ErAcr protein will be paired with a novel CRISPR-Cas nuclease and developed into a therapy for SMA> The therapy will be packaged into an adeno-associated viral vector and tested for editing and SMA disease correction in patient-derived cells and in an SMA mouse model. Effective editing will lead to disease correction in both patient cells and mice with no observable off-target editing events.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance clinical outcomes for patients with a traumatic or palliative peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In the U.S., 20 million people suffer from PNIs, with a high prevalence among young individuals and a total economic cost to society in excess of $150 billion per year. Acute PNIs account for more than 500,000 annual surgical procedures in the U.S and frequently result in permanent disability. This project develops a platform technology with the potential to address many types of PNI.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a novel nerve graft/conduit for nerve gap injury repair and a nerve cap.  The project goal is to advance a solution to improve the nerve functional outcome while still reducing the tension across the repair.  It provides a tissue-like matrix that allows aligned nerve growth out of the free nerve ending. The technology is derived from decellularized porcine nerve tissue and maintains native structural and functional proteins, providing an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration. This project conducts in-vivo studies, sterilization demonstrations, and lyophilization. Supply chain security, packaging development, and tooling will be developed in preparation for commercial launch.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop strategies to mitigate occlusion of thoracic catheters (chest tubes). A study by the Cleveland Clinic determined that 36% of chest tubes were completely obstructed at one point, with 86% of these clots existing in the thoracic cavity, undetected by clinicians. The complications that result from occluded chest tubes can include postoperative atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade. The team will design, develop, and commercialize a novel chest tube to solve the high impact clinical need. This  novel chest tube seeks to reduce drainage-related complications following cardiothoracic surgery. The novel system proactively manages fluid flow within the inner lumen of a catheter in order to flush and drain the tube, reducing the incidence of blood clogging.

    The proposed activity seeks to develop a chest tube that proactively provides fluid flow in order to prevent blood clot formation associated with draining fluid and blood during cardiovascular surgery. The product introduces a novel approach called dilutional coagulopathy for addressing clotting issues, where sterile saline or anticoagulants is proactively used to reduce thrombosis in an enclosed drainage spaces, rather than rely on historical methods of chemical or mechanical barriers for reducing or hindering clot formation. The project aims to develop prototypes using biomaterials and fabrication methods suitable for eventual patient use, and undertake the risks of demonstrating proof of concept and reduced clotting in an animal model of post-surgical drainage complications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is develop an innovative medical technology for localized and sustained antibiotic treatment in the case of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The proposed activities may result in commercialization of an implant with novel reservoir technology to be placed at the infected site, and which will locally deliver antibiotics to eradicate the infection. This solution may improve patient care as well as reduce costs associated with treatment of infection. The development of an implantable, antibiotic-eluting orthopedic spacer which enables patients to return to ambulatory conditions while providing sustained, appropriate, anti-infection resistance for a sustained duration could benefit patients and reduce medical costs. The proposed product seeks to reduce infections and reduce the need for surgical revision and significant antibiotic treatments. If successful, this technology will reduce the burden associated with unresolved infections and avoid amputations.

    This team will design, develop, and validate the proof of concept for an orthopedic spacer. The system will be 3-D printed using a novel porous medium capable of controlled antibiotic elution.  The product will be tested using benchtop mechanical testing and in vitro studies of implanted system viability and controlled elution. The objectives include a study of the prototype's ability to meet design criteria for mechanical performance, as well as a demonstration of a superior antibiotic elution profile over an extended-release period. The mechanical testing to be performed include load, stress, and cycle testing within current standards, in conjunction with in vitro laboratory elution testing of the specified antibiotic substance over a sustained duration of time (up to >180 days).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the creation of a "digital twin," a real-world system projected into spatially-computed environment such as virtual and augmented reality. This technology creates the infrastructure necessary for the application of virtual and augmented reality in industrial workplaces, at scale. By making the full-scale roll out of these technologies possible, the technology seeks to impact human health and safety, operational efficiencies, and environmental risk reduction for process operations facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The long term impacts of the technology may also enable automation and optimization, improving their efficiency, security, and safety. Such facilities are critical infrastructure and play a significant role in the national economy. The availability of this product may also enhance market opportunities for other businesses in the scanning, spatial computing, and training markets. The impact may be further broadened by adapting the process for digital twin production to new domains unrelated to the industrial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing knowledge and understanding in both machine learning and spatial computing. This project focuses on a method for digitizing a complex, real-world system, in an efficient manner, sufficient to recreate the captured reality as an interactive digital twin. The primary technical hurdle is the combining of different data sources that describe aspects of a particular real-world system into a single complete description. The initial physical systems being modelled are industrial process operations, but the core methods could apply to other types of systems, including natural systems, such as a rainforest. For industrial process operations, the goal is to encode the entire process operations facilities at the component level, with sub-cm accuracy, at 10% of the current time and cost requirements. To achieve this, this project will combine physical scans with engineering documentation and relational probabilities. Once combined, the model will be used as the basis for a digital twin of the real-world system projected into spatial computed environments, such as virtual and augmented reality. These techniques replace a tedious and impractical static scan and human labor workflow with rapid scans, computer vision, and a combination of procedural and trained algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of
    conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often
    uncomfortable in the early days because they aren’t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student
    personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be development of a novel platform for the design and high-volume fabrication of microfluidic devices for educational and research purposes. Currently used fabrication methods are not conducive to the large-scale production of robust, high quality, open-channel microfluidic devices that are cost-effective for widespread use outside of specialty applications. The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels. The kits will contribute to educational efforts that address the nation’s demand for STEM professionals, projected to grow at twice the rate of all occupations in the next 10 years, while training students in a field expected to reach a $60 billion market value by 2029.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to eliminate the main technical hurdles that prevent the large scale production of open-channel microfluidic devices. Current lithographic, additive and micromilling fabrication technologies require a combination of expertise, equipment and production time that make them ill-suited for the purpose of assembling devices that are inexpensive and robust enough for consumer use, for example, in educational settings. The proposed platform will leverage new and existing high-volume fabrication technologies to manufacture film-based devices with channels and chambers measured in the tens and hundreds of micrometers, featuring strong bonding between layers to allow for high pressure flow, and at a projected cost of <0.15 USD per device. Research objectives include the development of gravity-based and hand powered pump setups appropriate for educational and low resource settings. The advancements in device fabrication processes achieved in this project are expected to have a positive impact beyond the field of education, facilitating the commercialization of microfluidic technologies in fields like analytical chemistry, biomanufacture and point-of-care biosensing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a stronger understanding of how living things absorb carbon in the ocean. It is important to have an accurate measure of the natural carbon uptake by the ocean because this affects ocean and fishery health, as well as future efforts to intentionally sequester carbon in the ocean to mitigate climate change. This goal will be achieved by developing a low-cost sensor that can be widely deployed on ocean robots, which are already being used to measure processes like ocean heat uptake. The sensor will use light to detect sinking debris in the ocean.  This debris is a major way that carbon is naturally sequestered in the ocean. Distributed, robotic platforms in the ocean allow observations to be made in locations and seasons that are not accessible with research ships. Such platforms are generally lower cost than sensors associated with research ships. Development and sale of sensors for robotic platforms are areas of growth because of the increasing reliance on these platforms for scientific observations. This project may also enhance academic and industry partnerships and help to train upcoming scientists and engineers in instrument development.

    There is a significant desire to expand measurements of ocean biological carbon pump processes to better understand climate change, in particular the flux of carbon by particles settling out of the surface ocean. This project will create a sensor that is designed to be carried aboard globally distributed, autonomous profiling floats.  The sensors/floats may help distinguish among the different modes of biological carbon uptake in the ocean. The sensor will be designed from the ground up to meet the challenges of sampling floats, which have stringent power consumption, cost, and data quality-control requirements. The sensor will also have specific optical and housing geometry characteristics tailored for measurement of sinking particle fluxes. The development stages will consist of optical modeling of proposed sensor geometries, modeling of particle collection efficiencies of different housing geometries, laboratory testing of model particles, and dissemination of results to the scientific community.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – often called “forever” chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.

    \ stressors such as soil salinity and drought, making the seeds more climate resilient.\
    \ The project will provide tools that will make it easier for microbe-based agriculture\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a viable and scalable process to manufacture a bamboo-based strand composite for application in low-cost roofing globally.  This project develops a new production process for exterior-grade natural fiber composite building products, derived from a highly renewable resource, bamboo, through public-private partnership.  The resulting roofing product will help protect users from extreme heat by passively cooling and reducing indoor temperatures. In addition, this solution can be used to create value-added energy-efficient building products from highly renewable natural fiber waste. The innovation holds immense potential to replace harmful and hazardous materials, including asbestos, in many regions of the world, store captured carbon into long-lifecycle products, and reduce heating and cooling energy use.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will: (i) refine the design of the 3D panel geometry used to make commercial-size panels with improved load-carrying capacity and constructability; (ii) improve the bamboo-stranding process, evaluate a bio-based adhesive system, impart fire-retardance, enhance panel durability, manufacture panels using the new geometry, and evaluate performance; and (iii) demonstrate and evaluate panel use as a roofing material through field tests and the versatility of the corrugated panel in interior and exterior energy-efficient building products. This research will advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing challenges of long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including moisture resistance, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide environmentally friendly, self-cleaning coating technologies. Fluorinated materials, known as forever materials, have been widely used due to their excellent self-cleaning properties, but the detrimental environmental impacts resulting from these coatings motivate the introduction of environmentally friendly solutions. This project plans to create a new technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties, and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g., excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion) while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and 3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the technology into  relevant applications. The anticipated results include successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace, to name a few.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is utilizing thermal energy management to simultaneously improve the affordability, comfort, and safety of buildings, with an initial focus on meeting urgent market demand for non-combustible building insulation.  This project will focus on developing a lightweight, easy-to-install, non-combustible insulation product which is also eco-friendly and non-toxic.  Structure fires represent 37% of all fires in the US. These fires caused $12.3 billion in property damage and 80% of civilian fire deaths.  Wildfires in the Western US, where >$220 billion in residential construction is in “extreme” wildfire-prone areas, add to the urgency of this situation.  Mineral wool is the only non-combustible insulation product available today but requires personal protective equipment for installation and was recently classified as carcinogenic.  Fully non-combustible building insulation is a high growth market, and the broader market for all types of non-flammable insulation represents a significant opportunity.  This Phase II project seeks to cost-effectively increase the supply of energy-efficient, non-combustible buildings for both new and retrofit construction, while also addressing high-temperature industrial markets which have the most intensive energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up a novel nanocomposite insulation product using a proprietary foaming process for inorganic aerogel-based insulation that minimizes shrinkage (thus maximizing porosity for insulation performance and minimizing material and processing cost). This approach leverages readily available materials such as clay and silica, as well as potentially renewable cellulose biomass, to produce an environmentally friendly, high performance insulation product for non-combustible buildings which is easy to install, lightweight, and non-toxic.  Successfully scaling this approach on existing manufacturing equipment may solve a significant materials research challenge, creating organic-inorganic nanocomposites for thermal insulation with a competitive cost / performance ratio versus incumbent products such as fiberglass, mineral wool, and plastic foams.  The Phase II project may result in the first industrially-engineered composite material for thermal insulation which is fully non-combustible.  The integration of flexible polymers and radiation blocking additives would also enable use for high-temperature industrial pipe insulation, a critical energy-saving application where most existing products have significant limitations due to radiation loss.

    \ Phase I project is to reduce emergency medical services (EMS) response times\
    \ and improve patient outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) through\
    \ the creation of a 911-integrated drone service. Sudden cardiac arrest is responsible\
    \ for more than 450,000 deaths annually and is the third leading cause of death\
    \ in the United States. Of these deaths, ~350,000 occur outside of the hospital.\
    \ Survival for OHCA in the U.S. is around 8%-10%, and despite considerable effort\
    \ this statistic has changed little over the past three decades. The solution\
    \ to improving OHCA outcomes is early and effective bystander cardiopulmonary\
    \ resuscitation (e.g., chest compressions) and prompt defibrillation using an\
    \ automated external defibrillator (AED). In locations with publicly-available\
    \ AEDs, survival has increased 40%-70%. However, ~70% of OHCAs events occur in\
    \ private residence, and public-access AEDs are not available for these patients.\
    \ Drones can deliver AEDs to the scene of a cardiac arrest more quickly than a\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to remediate the 17 million tons of textile waste that ends up in landfills annually. Working within the existing economic drivers of the clothing industry, this project aims to deploy technology that can profitably transition the USA away from a wasteful zero-sum linear raw materials model into a resilient local and sustainable circular economy. This project will enable local communities, urban and rural alike, to create economic value (raw materials and jobs) out of textile waste, with a drastic reduction in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions compared to business as usual. This project will develop technology that has an impact on the security and sustainability of the US textile raw materials marketplace, by enabling a re-shoring of an industry in a distributed way that can affect every single American through their clothing purchasing options. If successful, the US could lead the world into a new era of a truly sustainable circular economy for fashion.

    This project aims to advance knowledge and develop the core technologies required for widespread adoption and commercialization of cellulosic textile recycling within the American textile manufacturing industry. By leveraging core competencies and innovative models for polymer science and continuous process design, this project will develop a non-destructive extractive process that will locally and domestically convert end-of-life textile waste into high-value cellulosic circular economy feedstocks of equal or greater quality to virgin material at kilogram scale. As part of this project, the focus will be on extracting cellulose from mixed material textile waste that contain other contaminant components that often hinder its recycling. This approach involves innovative mixtures of green chemistry that enable the rapid extraction of cotton, the spinning of novel fibres, and the efficient recovery of the process chemicals. This project will optimise and further develop this core technology and conduct the prototyping and engineering design required for reproducible cellulosic material (cotton) extraction from clothing waste and its demonstration at multi-kg scale.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality and reproducibility of cancer diagnosis and margin screening.Surgery currently represents the best opportunity for curing invasive cancers but is limited by modern pathology methods. Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for skin cancer because it results in the highest cure rates, but it often takes place in stages, extending surgical procedures. The use of ex vivo confocal microscopy (XVM) is potentially faster, less costly, and inherently both 3-D and digitized, with benefits including: 1) enhanced accuracy, precision, and margin control via enriched 3D information content and simplified specimen orientation maintenance, decreasing error and improving functional outcomes; 2) decreased duration of open surgical wounds potentially reducing the rate of complications; and (3) enhanced and accelerated surgical workflows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve Mohs surgery and other margin screening applications. Using confocal image processing software, the proposed software will improve current pathology processing methods by enabling rapid processing and re-coloring of XVM images, visualization without the need for retraining, and automated detection of residual tumor at the patient’s bedside, all within minutes. The research described here will result in the production of a fully functional and robust software product through the following development projects: 1) Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software for image preprocessing and colorization/enhancement, and 2) AI-based software for automated identification of key morphological features and diagnosis of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The proposed technology will streamline cancer specimen processing, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  II project is to improve disease research and drug discovery. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most impactful and vital tools of biological structure analysis today.  The proposed project improves the current methods to achieve better accuracy and productivity, with faster user training.

    The proposed project improves imaging by cryo-EM. The images currently generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy and thus requires extensive processing to build recognizable structures (proteins and others). Single-particle cryo-EM is a method that produces images of individual particles and can potentially analyze biological structures at the single-molecule level.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques to mitigate the issues.  AI/ML algorithms can automate the workflow, facilitating quality data and the development of 3D models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to help the 60% of the 21 million African American women in the US who are overweight or obese, increasing their risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in greater severity than the general population.  This project overcomes barriers to weight management in African American women through its customized data library. The proposed automated food tracker is combined with a social network function to incentivize new users to engage with the application. These features provide a powerful tool for the user to achieve a healthy body mass index and maintain health over a lifetime.

    The proposed project is a mobile weight-loss management application to help African American manage diet and track physical activity. It helps women build their knowledge of proper nutrition and follow a healthy lifestyle, thereby improving adherence rates for diet and exercise regimens. The application's innovation is to automate the tracking of food intake from the users with image recognition and machine learning algorithms. This innovation creates a unique data set for foods common in the African American community, labeling the carbohydrates, calories, proteins, fats, and serving size.  This automatic process provides a framework that eliminates the barriers created by the manual calculations that current solutions require. Furthermore, it will incorporate a game-like interface to increase engagement for better long-term weight management outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities. This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper insights into their customers’ hair care-related goals, pain points, and health conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors (porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1) Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-esteem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling (unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels) of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation. This project seeks to develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed. This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to ship hulls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas. The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous, electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls. This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial transport and Naval vessels can be addressed.  The project will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the participation of the underrepresented population of blind and low vision (BLV) persons in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Through a novel assistive technology that provides BLV individuals with multisensory access to scientific data in real time, this technology will enable access  on par with sighted peers. BLV students, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data whether in the laboratory or in the field. This inaccessibility either precludes their full participation in hands-on science inquiry, or leaves them dependent on sighted peers to access real-time data. With this project, BLV students across K-12 and post-secondary institutions, as well as BLV scientists and others interested in STEM, will benefit from a tool that makes it possible for them to work independently in laboratory situations. This innovation will make science laboratory learning and laboratory workplaces more inclusive and equitable for the blind and low vision individuals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing a 2-dimensional, hand-held, portable, refreshable Braille and tactile graphics scientific data collection tool that can be used to collect quantifiable data in real time using wireless sensors. Blind and Low Vision (BLV) students are as capable as their sighted peers in STEM yet, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data in the laboratory. This effort seeks to address this inequity by leveraging the expertise of blind scientists and pioneers in STEM access technology to iteratively develop a interative versions of novel, blind-accessible innovations which will give BLV students, scientists and others access to quantitative data collected in the laboratory or in the field. This innovation will be optimized for the BLV by documenting usability concerns and making the necessary modifications to hardware and source-code prior to field-testing.

Additionally, the proposed technology will address anode stability and advance studies in novel platinum group metal anodes. The team will use multi-physics modeling for high-temperature electrolysis and for modeling low gravity and lunar vacuum environments. The project may result in the ability to extract oxygen and raw metals from lunar regoliths advancing research in space resource extraction efforts. This advancement in knowledge may aide in the research and development efforts in the fields of materials science, inorganic chemistry, and metallurgy which could result in the carbon-free production of steel and other metals on Earth, new anode materials for high-temperature electrolysis, new electrochemical processes for electrorefining raw feedstocks, and the ability to source oxygen and metals from the Moon and other planetary bodies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the current lack of useful, realistic feedback in commercially available bionic prosthetic devices. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide closed loop control through sensory feedback. Without this type feedback, prosthesis users tend to avoid manipulating certain objects because they run the risk of handling them incorrectly or destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research seeks to develop a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. The expected outcomes of this research are: a controller that can regulate both intensity and quality sensation and a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for day-to-day manipulation tasks. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million upper limb amputees worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enhance a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator, by integrating a control system that will be able to regulate both intensity and quality of sensation. The design and controller of this stimulator are unique.  The stimulator will integrate existing prosthetic hand systems. The sensation controller will modulate stimulation parameters to compensate for changes in measured resistance between the electrode-skin interface, thus reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The sensation controller will also maintain a consistent quality of sensation throughout usage. Upon completion of the Phase II project, the prosthetic technology will be a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reducing the cost of getting people online and connecting people in emergency situations such as natural disasters. Natural disasters often destroy cellular networks, exactly when people need communication the most. The influx of users on the limited remaining infrastructure often overwhelms existing resources, making it impossible for first responders to coordinate, for families to call their loved ones, and for volunteers to help. In other potential markets, the technology seeks to provide cellular phone access to parts of the world where it is now prohibitively expensive. This project seeks to develop small, portable cellular base stations that can provide access in both emergency and hard to reach and poorly resourced locations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project researches and implements a small, portable cellular base station. The technological focus for the base station utilizes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (or 2G and 2.5G) radio for communicating with a high density of cell phones in a computationally cheap manner while utilizing WiFi for local, high bandwidth applications. The technology implements many “micro-cells” in lieu of the current macro cell approach to cellular coverage, blanketing the area with a high number of towers. This decentralized approach provides high reliability even if one or several nodes fail. This project will develop the algorithms necessary for interconnecting large numbers of base stations together and mesh the networking capabilities that provide radio links between each base station. Finally, this project will finalize the mechanical design and make the base station manufacturable at large scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration with a new type of three-dimensional (3D) sensor. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate in densely crowded spaces in a safe and socially compliant/acceptable manner. A key potential outcome is the development of a collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).  This method would be capable of handling dense crowds and optimized to run on compact and power-efficient embedded processors. Such abilities would increase the commercial potential and adoption of learning-based navigation methods that have demonstrated excellent collision avoidance and noise handling capabilities. The technology may unlock commercial opportunities by deploying AMRs in the airport, retail, healthcare, and hospitality industries, where the environments are highly dense and dynamic. The airport industry may derive postive impacts from AMRs that can navigate in complex, indoor environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are not allowed by providing contactless deliveries of food, beverages, and other retail products to travelers at the gate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a hybrid collision avoidance approach enabling autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate safely in dense crowds, while being socially-compliant in sparse scenarios. Preliminary research has shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches can compute collision-free robot velocities with inaccurate, uncertain perception data. The proposed DRL-based model will be implemented as an optimized neural network that works on power and cost-efficient embedded processors.  The key technical hurdles in this technology are: the DRL model trained in simulation may not perform well in real-world environments (known as sim-to-real gap), the fully-trained DRL model may have some performance degradation compared to the company’s current DRL models due to the lower number of parameters used to run on embedded processors, and the localization modules could compute erroneous locations when the AMR is navigating through a dense crowd due to occlusions. The key objectives of Phase I are to address these challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the reduction of honey bee colony mortality by up to 75% through early identification and improved breeding of pest- and disease-resistant colonies. Honey bees are dying at unprecedented rates, with annual losses up to 45% in the United States. A primary cause of colony death is the parasitic mite Varroa. The unhealthy brood odor (UBO) assay is a pheromone-based tool that reduces labor costs required to measure Varroa-resistance by 18x, accelerating decision-making by 20%. The assay’s user-friendly design makes honey bee selection and queen evaluation more accessible to beekeepers, who are often restricted by the high technical skill and/or extensive labor required for existing assays. The UBO assay has potential to improve honey bee health and increase profitability of beekeeping operations, and thus may significantly improve global crop pollination and food security.

    The proposed project will assess the technical feasibility of using a honey bee pheromone-based assay to predict colony-level disease- and pest-resistance. This novel tool has the potential to improve honey bee health, revolutionize honey bee breeding, and inform important apiary management decisions, as it improves efficiency and efficacy of honey bee selection by enabling rapid and accurate identification of Varroa-resistant honey bee colonies. However, to be highly effective and achieve widespread uptake the technology must be practically and economically accessible, must perform consistently despite environmental variability, and must be established as a reliable indicator of heritable Varroa-resistance traits. The proposed research will employ sophisticated behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery, reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of Varroa-resistance traits identified by colony response to the prototype assay. Expected results include improvements to the safety and efficiency of the product delivery system, improved understanding of the effects of environmental variability on product performance, and confirmation of the heritability of traits identified by honey bee behavioral response to in-hive tests of the product.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve reuse of wastewater.  This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.

    The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities—by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.

    The Broader Impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support widespread distribution and adoption of sterilizing biopesticides that are effective and efficient to control Lepidoptera. Lepidopterans, such as the corn earworm, circumvent insecticidal properties of certain crops by developing resistance.  Models show that incorporating sterile insects in a corn earworm population can suppress the incidence of resistant individuals in the populations.  Enhancing oral infectivity of this sterilizing insect biopesticide will improve product manufacturing, distribution and most importantly, ease of use to support farmer adoption.

    The proposed project develops a functional orally-infectious formula of a specific strain of the sexually-transmitted, sterilizing-virus, Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV2). The resulting technology will be suitable for prototyping and testing oral formulations for sterilizing adult corn earworm moths. Genetic selection and candidate gene approaches are proposed to improve stability of the virus entry complex required for oral infectivity. This project will decorate viral envelopes with genes absent from HzNV-2 and thereby improve virion stability.  The pseudotyped virus will be assayed for increased oral infectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).  Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.  This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.

    The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.  The project will develop a test to measures a compound's biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to commercialize a novel technology that enables compact, efficient, silent, reliable, and fuel-flexible power generation. Existing power solutions can lack endurance, reliability, and portability and often generate harmful emissions; or they are prohibitively expensive or incompatible with existing fuels and distribution infrastructure.  The power generation platform developed in this project has the potential to be a key enabling technology for the future rapid growth of commercial drone applications, which currently are often limited by the performance of lithium ion batteries. Drones are expected to make an impact across numerous industries including transport and delivery, power and utilities, telecommunications, and remote sensing. Additionally, this power generation technology can benefit industrial internet of things applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel power source that is easily portable and is compatible with existing fuel infrastructure. This project develops a system that converts most fuels to electricity via light; combustion heats a nanophotonic material to incandescence and the resulting light drives photovoltaic cells. The nanophotonic material is engineered to be spectrally matched to the photovoltaic cells, enabling efficient conversion. This technology can increase the endurance of drones or other systems up to ten times over batteries alone. This work is focused on cost reduction through new material development. The specific research objectives are to demonstrate a low-cost and scalable process for the nanophotonic material and photovoltaic cell while maintaining high performance, and then integrate and pilot the low cost system. Successful completion of these objectives will enable this technology to translate to drone applications with a compelling need for long-lasting portable power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a scalable carbon nanotube (CNT) production process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of the production process. This project will support domestic supply chains for CNT materials at potentially disruptively low cost-levels. There is market need for low cost CNTs to companies where replacement of existing additives with CNTs can lead to improved products at equivalent or lower cost. Two examples of this are in battery additives or tire additives, where CNTs can replace lower quality carbon black materials to break traditional materials trade-offs such as energy vs power density (batteries) or fuel efficiency vs lifetime (tires).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, sustainable electrochemical Carbon Nanotube (CNT) production technology, which uses CO2 and electricity to produce high quality CNT products that meet and exceed the quality metrics of today's market products, while feasibly offering a disruptively lower priced CNT product.  This project leverages experience in electrochemistry and carbon nanomaterials synthesis to develop rapidly scalable electrode architectures and preparation processes to fabricate such electrode architectures that enable the production of CNTs at cost structures that are truly disruptive in the marketplace and enable rapid commercialization.  To further complement these technical efforts, this project optimizes post-growth CNT processing to better align products for customer integration and utilization.  Finally, this work will demonstrate the commercial viability of the approach and a scaling pathway for the materials platform.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable wider adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across industries such as real estate, agriculture, construction, energy, entertainment, oil & gas, and journalism.  The project develops advanced UAV camera systems with seamless 360-degree imaging capabilities to increase flight time and the imaging capability. End users benefit from reduced labor demands and real-time high-fidelity images of remote areas otherwise inaccessible. Industrial inspections, crop management, field surveying, and site security are most often conducted by deploying humans into the field - often creating labor bottlenecks and potentially dangerous situations. Adoption of UAVs for these applications can be limited by image processing that consumes too much power for UAV use, delayed image presentation affecting navigation capabilities, or image artifacts that obscure the details pertinent to market needs.  These limitations can all be overcome with the camera technologies developed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a lightweight, parallax-free, 360-degree panoramic camera system with an innovative optical design based on a polyhedron-shaped configuration of adjacent cameras. Each camera's field of view closely abuts but does not overlap with the next, enabling seamless and computationally simplistic capture of images from 360-degree views, while limiting blind regions and lost content between cameras. This approach eliminates the stitching errors and image distortion associated with wide angle lenses and multi-camera systems, and reduces the computational demand for 360-degree image capture. As a result, low energy edge-computing presents images in real time with minimal impact on flight time or energy use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications. Furthermore, this project advances system designs optimized for UAV weight and size, as well as improved concepts for kinematic space frames, in which the cameras can be integrated to form robust multi-camera systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the environment with cleaner diesel engine exhaust. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.  This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of an aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery that is a replacement for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries in stationary energy storage applications.  This battery has a nonflammable, environmentally-friendly, water-based electrolyte and does not utilize cobalt or nickel, reducing reliance on critical materials and helping to diversify battery material supply chains.  The battery chemistry combines the high safety and low cost associated with zinc-based batteries with the long life of lithium-ion batteries.  This aqueous battery may help to advance the adoption of beneficial energy technologies such as intermittent renewables and electric vehicles.  The battery utilizes zinc that can be sourced domestically and does not introduce a dependency on foreign sources, promoting both national security and the creation of US-based jobs.  The battery is also fully recyclable using existing methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery technology by focusing on optimization of individual battery components to improve cycle life and power as well as scale up from pouch cells to larger-format prismatic cells.  The research will include refining the intercalation electrode design to increase capacity retention during long life cycling, developing the zinc electrode design to suppress zinc dendrite growth, improving separator functionality to maintain high-rate capabilities and increase cycle life, and developing an electrolyte designed to stabilize zinc while also allowing for faster reactivity with the zinc and lithium ions.  Larger format cells with optimized components will be built and tested to evaluate scaled real-world performance metrics compared to Lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries traditionally used in stationary energy storage applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance energy sustainability, especially regarding estimation, understanding, and optimization of real-time grid carbon emissions. Decarbonizing the grid means reducing its carbon emissions by decreasing the emissions per unit of electricity generated. In-depth, accurate knowledge of real-time grid emissions will facilitate various grid decarbonization use cases and applications ranging from corporate carbon accounting, carbon-aware energy management, and new emission tracking standards to future electricity and carbon market design. More broadly, the prposed platform may demonstrate that achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reductions via co-optimization for costs and carbon is possible and provide a commercially viable, scalable path for policy makers, regulators, and corporations to meet their ambitious sustainability commitments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop novel and practical approaches to estimate, learn, and optimize real-time grid emissions. The Phase II project will optimize carbon estimation and forecast models, develop decision-making algorithms, implement the proposed methods as software, and validate the software platform through pilots. The team seeks to will build a user-friendly, cloud-based software platform with multiple applications that will enable climate regulators and sustainability directors to meet their public commitments and stay compliant with new regulations. Integrating real-time carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management is a critical challenge. Little is known about real-time carbon signals from the grid and the proposed project aims to demystify grid emissions to enable accurate, actionable, and transparent carbon tracking, reporting, and management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a breakthrough power source for small electronic devices that will move the reality of smart cities and smart rural areas closer to the vision. The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the 'Internet-of-Things' vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures.

    The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of "things" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to more completely understand the real world through a perfect virtual copy. This SBIR Phase II project makes it possible to create virtual reproductions of real cities that not only show how the world looks, but reproduce every object and every detail perfectly, allowing users to interact with it. These virtual copies make it possible to quickly and effectively train soldiers and first responders, train autonomous ground and flying vehicles, place new construction into a dense city, simulate the effects of catastrophic weather, and explore imaginary scenarios through games. Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project addresses a paradox faced by ‘open web’ developers, users, and regulators: the use of centralized platform-creator hosted web portals to interact with an evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) application ecosystem. The proposed work will instrument a new open web paradigm that will improve user accessibility and ability to compose and perform data analysis on smart contracts. The approach will enable improvement of web-service reliability and security while weeding out bad actors.  Improving the accessibility and analysis of smart contracts is anticipated to help unlock further value and solutions across a range of applications and new business opportunities that can benefit from dynamic contracting.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build a blockchain-adjacent metadata model that enhances the utility and security of smart contracts for users and developers. The project will undertake the practical challenge of reverse-engineering smart contracts to outline a metadata model which will enhance discovery and security of services, creating a scaffold for composable apps. The approach will organize blockchain abstractions through code similarity analysis and program de-obfuscation by reverse engineering, instrument compile-time creation and publish metadata models by developers, and demonstrate how this data can be used to build a composable app user experience. The project will deploy privacy-preserving targeted advertising frameworks using deterministic services alongside the data from the metadata model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of lightweight, thermally safe batteries with high energy densities that can be charged fast, last a long time, are composed of environmentally benign materials, and can store energy at a low cost. Such batteries would enable the large-scale penetration of long-range electric cars and other electric vehicles, including airplanes and drones in transportation.  This process reduces environmental pollution and leads to greater energy efficiency.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to use boron nitride based layered ceramic materials as a means of storing electrochemical energy in solid state batteries.  This project enhances scientific and technological understanding on the design of advanced functional materials for energy storage at the atomic level.  To achieve the targeted high performance energy storage at the macroscopic level, the underlying material structures must be carefully selected on the atomic and molecular levels.  Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, may contain functional groups that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized and can be utilized as electroactive species in cathodes of rechargeable batteries. The great advantage of these materials is that they can realize simultaneously high energy and power density for thousands of charging/discharging cycles as demonstrated in graphene oxide batteries with lithium and sodium anodes.  Graphene oxide is, however, thermally unstable.  The project proposes to substitute graphene oxide with functionalized boron nitride in order to achieve thermal stability while preserving performance.  Furthermore, the functionalized boron nitride is also capable to play the role of a solid electrolyte in addition to being an electroactive species.  Particular focus will be made on synthesizing -OBF3 functionalized boron nitride. This functional group occurs as a Lewis adduct of surface oxides (such as graphene oxide or boron nitride oxide) with BF3 (an electrolyte component) and is particularly promising as a compact electroactive species and electrolyte.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content is commonly limited to very short clips (typically < 10 seconds) due to huge file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices. both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment and telecommunications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable. The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time. There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard HD video content.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safe, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy storage solution.  This project offers a non-chemical, non-hazardous alternative energy storage to accelerate grid modernization and non-polluting renewable power integration.  The project’s core technology is a design that is cost competitive with deployed Lithium ion (Li-ion) chemical batteries, but would be significantly less expensive per charge than Li-ion over its 30+ year service life.  This proposed approach allows the long-term advantages of kinetic (flywheel) energy storage (low service life costs, high power throughput, high daily charge cycles, no battery replacements, potential for 24/7 operations) and makes it affordable and safer for deployed stationary grid operations. With solar and wind renewables on par with traditional carbon-based power generation costs, affordable flywheel energy storage is vital to store and dispense intermittent renewable power, enabling the replacement of carbon-based power generation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a comprehensive testing effort to verify the technical feasibility of the project’s 3D flywheel composite structure for next-generation energy storage systems. The proposed research and testing objectives are to demonstrate the improved 3D flywheel performance and projected 9x reduction in the traditional flywheel weight for the same energy storage capability. Testing methodology includes dynamic balancing, torque transmission determination, critical failure/fatigue modeling, assessing magnetically coupled commercial external motor/generator power transmission and performance in a TRL-5 operational vacuum environment. The effort will also include energy storage market analysis for commercial market entry based on tested 3D flywheel performance. Anticipated results include the characterization of the 3D flywheel structural technology, demonstrated commercial subsystem operations and readiness to develop a full prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to improve the assessment of cognitive and motor skills in K-6 students. More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the introduction of non-flammable, easy-to-manufacture solid battery electrolytes that are also compatible with lithium metal. The cell architecture seeks to ensure safety while enabling a significant improvement in the energy density.  The teams also seeks to lower the costs of the lithium-ion batteries by eliminating extrinsic costs associated with thermal management and explosion containment.  Safe, easy-to-manufacture electrolytes may alter the rate of electrification of the global economy. The next generation of battery powered medical devices, a large proportion of which are manufactured in the United States, may also benefit from the adoption of the new solid electrolyte. In addition, the proposed composite solid electrolyte aims to enable new cell architectures with significantly higher energy densities than what has been possible in liquid electrolyte systems to date.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a non-flammable, high-conductivity composite, solid-state battery electrolytes that are compatible with mixed metal oxide cathode chemistries and cell manufacturing processes. The morphology of the composite electrolyte is such that it offsets disadvantages present in polymer electrolytes, as well as inorganic sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes, when they are used as monolithic materials. The unique heterostructures of the proposed solid electrolytes advance the current state-of-the-art by enabling faster diffusion of lithium ions through multiple pathways, while mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte's nonflammable nature makes it a potential replacement for conventional liquid electrolytes in reducing fire hazards and reducing the costs of reqired thermal protection systems in lithium-ion batteries. The compatibility with lithium metal presents a unique opportunity for improvement in the energy density over currently used silicon-graphite anodes, that translates to a lower cost per unit of stored energy ($/kWh). An additional advantage is that these batteries do not require special handling and they are compatible with both spiral wound and planar battery form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to facilitate access to banking services through use of blockchain/distributed ledger technology, even with limited internet access. The proposed technology can make transfers more affordable and convenient. Digitizing transfers increases speed, reduces exchange and transfer fees, and lowers the risk associated with carrying cash.  This proposed technology enables access for the 13 million people currently underserved by the financial industry.  If successful, this technology could improve efficiency and resilience of transfers worldwide. The project's anticipated results include 60% cost reduction compared to traditional transfer systems, <30 second transaction completions, and an anticipated 0% fraud rate.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research and develop a blockchain-based solution to store, send, and make transfers without a smartphone or internet. The proposed core technology includes a blockchain back-end that powers an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) front-end, allowing mobile devices to securely send and receive data without an internet connection. This project’s intellectual merit lies in (1) developing the first-of-its-kind blockchain-based system for international transactions with access even in low bandwidth/no bandwidth environments; (2) creating a digital identity protocol that is distributed, accessible offline, and usable by any entity without exposing personally identifiable information (PII); and (3) developing the first machine learning-based microlending algorithms using offline behaviors to predict, prompt, and automate actions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes providing a high-throughput system for recycling critical metals like cobalt to reduce the conventional energy-intensive mining and refining processes used to produce materials for manufacturing today. Most importantly, this project will help secure a supply of critical materials, reducing the United States’ reliance on foreign supply chains and guaranteeing a secondary source of battery materials. A new, domestic supply will also reduce the social and human health impacts associated with artisanal mining, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to (1) validate novel electro-extraction nanotechnology based separations technology in the battery recycling and cobalt mining space, and (2) validate a new, value-added product (a battery cathode precursor material) for this rapidly growing market, rendering the conventional refining stages unnecessary.   The proposed electroextraction process utilizes flow-through water electrolysis to produce high local concentrations of hydroxide to precipitate transition metals as metal hydroxides.  This understanding will allow tuning the device operating conditions for metal or mixed-metal specific precipitation, for example, the precipitation of Ni-Mn-Co hydroxides at battery stoichiometries or highly selective precipitation of individual metals.

    \ Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the introduction of a new wind farm control\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address fire and explosion safety hazards associated with lithium ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage technologies. Fueled by growth in the energy storage and electric vehicle industries, the Li-ion battery market is expected to grow to a size of several hundred billion dollars by 2025. Future viability of these clean energy technologies are dependent on Li-ion battery technology. However, Li-ion batteries occasionally catastrophically fail, posing thermal hazards as serious as fires and explosions.  The proposed technology has the potential to be an effective, low cost solution and accelerating adoption of transformative clean energy technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the safety of Li-ion bateries. Under certain scenarios, Li-ion batteries can fail, resulting in an exothermic release of flammable and toxic gases. For applications including large multi-cell battery systems in energy storage and vehicle use, the risk of thermal runaway can result in catastrophic fires, explosions and toxic gas release that can damage nearby infrastructure and cause injury or death. Thermal runaway poses significant challenges for available suppression and mitigation systems because the hazardous gas release can continue despite suppression of the incipient fire. The proposed thermal runaway protection and suppression technology addresses the source of the hazards by exploiting a series of novel physio-chemical processes to reduce flammable and toxic gas species concentrations released during a thermal runaway event.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will significantly lower the initial cost of residential and commercial ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems used in space heating and cooling applications. GSHPs are inherently more energy efficient than most heating and cooling technologies. This technology will accelerate electrification of the US economy, lessen the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels, reduce peak electricity demand, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. GSHPs operate quietly and reliably, provide humidity control, and can provide both heating and cooling, greatly increasing the comfort of building environments and quality of life. GSHPs can also reduce and levelize utility bills in low-income housing and enhance the ability to provide energy assistance programs to those in need.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further develop a novel technology that will overcome barriers in the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The project’s chief technical objectives are to improve tools and knowhow relating to the application of the proposed novel in-ground heat exchanger technology and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this technology in real-world applications in targeted geographical markets. Specifically, the project will further refine the computational modeling tools used to size heat exchanger systems; and develop and integrate sophisticated geospatial data sets that these models will use/ This will result in more accurate and more rapid heat exchanger sizing on a site-specific basis. Next, the project will validate these tools through extended testing and data collection on a prototype system installed on a home system. Finally, this project will apply these tools during the deployment of three commercial systems in targeted geographic markets and collect additional data regarding their performance over time.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve lowering the barrier to adoption of renewable energy generation and energy storage. The project seeks to take advantage the sheer abundance and low costs of sodium materials compared to state-of-the-art lithium materials. This will reduce upfront energy storage cost and in turn the payback time and costs of electricity for end users can be significantly reduced. The United States has 23 billion tons of domestic sodium reserves, which makes up 88% of the global supply of sodium. Successful utilization of the vast U.S. sodium reserves in new battery technologies will significantly reduce import reliance of critical materials and alleviate supply chain limitations on lithium-based materials. This project will accelerate the adoption of solar and renewable energy generation, making the grid cleaner, more sustainable, and more resilient.

    This research project advances new batteries enabled by a novel halide-based sodium solid state electrolyte. The technology offers several beneficial properties compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries: enhanced safety due to the use of completely nonflammable materials, higher volumetric energy density by using a dense alloy-based anode, lowered costs due to the abundance of sodium-based raw materials, and improved longevity from the use of superior halide-based solid-state electrolytes. Unlike the commonly used sulfide-based or oxide-based solid electrolyte materials, the halide-based innovation provides enhanced electrochemical and chemical stability while eliminating the need for high temperature sintering during fabrication. This project develops the halide solid electrolyte material, improving its baseline material ionic conductivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, as well as exploring scalable synthesis routes using single-step fabrication at room temperature.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new class of batteries for transportation. The proposed battery design will maximize the rate of charge and battery lifetime while maintaining high energy density, in contrast with current battery research that primarily focuses on maximizing energy density. This new operating parameter will open the design space for smaller batteries that result in lighter weight, lower cost and longer life vehicle platforms to enable all-electric transportation. In addition, the new operating parameters enable the widespread adoption of two new applications, (i) vehicle to grid and (ii) mobility as a service. The associated reduction of greenhouse gases will be 1+ gigaton annually.

    The proposed project develops a lithium battery coin cell that demonstrates 3 minutes ultrafast charge and 20,000 extended cycle life performance, using the novel disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode. This project explores ultrafast charge lithium ion battery platforms.  Technical objectives include: 1) charging times comparable to filling up today's gas tanks; 2) batteries with a higher safety profile that last the entire service life of the vehicle; 3) vehicles that can connect to the electric grid for renewables integration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.

    The SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project improves inventory management.  An estimated $818 billion is lost annually due to incomplete knowledge of a company’s inventory.  The problem occurs because of the absence of a label at manufacturing that survives through the supply chain (retail, logistics, and end user). Currently, traditional supply chain management forces a company to add at least one new tag at each step. This project will reduce the number of tags per product, exponentially decrease waste, increase supply chain efficiency, and prevent knockoffs or counterfeits from being added to the supply chain. All of this will help businesses run more effectively, better serve customers, and enable consumers to gain detailed knowledge of their purchases.

    The intellectual merit of this project is development of the first commercially viable, cradle-to-grave inventory tag through optimization and scalability tasks. The innovation is a chipless inventory tag with a unique serial number for every product to provide the cradle-to-grave functionality. The underlying Material Adjusted Signature Tag (MAST) technology uses printable materials to create a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. The MAST tags will enable direct printing or application of a tag onto a product, allowing an efficient way to reliably identify, track, and attribute data to a product throughout its life. This project will improve the tag’s data potential, optimize manufacturability, and achieve greater readability. Beyond optimization and scalability milestones, this project will test the tags, readers, and manufacturing equipment in relevant environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of automatically refocusing reading glasses for wide adoption by the two billion people with presbyopia, a common form of vision loss with age that prevents focusing on nearby objects. Current presbyopia corrections, such as reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses, are unwieldy or unnatural solutions that fail to perfectly replace healthy vision. An automatically refocusing system will provide an attractive alternative by restoring natural vision, such that objects are brought into focus according to where the user looks. With a lightweight and robust implementation for all-day use, such a system will be poised for wide translation to address a ubiquitous cause of decreased productivity and quality of life for billions worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop key technologies leading to the miniaturization of the automatically refocusing glasses. Existing systems address only the highest performance implementations of full 3D gaze estimation for demanding applications like VR or AR, and they are too power-hungry and large for automatically refocusing reading glasses. This project will develop a customized hardware and software system for novel depth-estimation specific to this application. The project will explore the trade space of weight, power consumption, and form factor to develop an optimal parameter set.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance a novel, reusable, intermittent, urinary catheterization system from a functional prototype to the final production-equivalent device. By progressing the system through additional design improvements and FDA submission, the goal of this project is to enable the product to reach the hands of individuals who require intermittent catheters to urinate. Current intermittent urinary catheter use is fraught with complications including frequent urinary tract infections, expensive supplies, and large material footprints, as well as the generation of a significant amount of plastic waste. This project seeks to improve the current catheter landscape by allowing for commercialization of a reusable catheter system that will reduce contact contamination during insertion, reduce plastic waste, and enable widespread use of high-quality urinary catheters by decreasing the per-use cost. Through these improvements, healthcare costs associated with intermittent catheterization can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, based on frequent interactions with individuals who catheterize and suffer from impaired dexterity, the design of the system will incorporate the needs and ideas of people who are often ignored during innovation within the current catheterization space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will finalize the design of a novel, reusable, intermittent urinary catheterization system and portable reprocessing device as well as advance the system towards commercialization. Intermittent urinary catheterization is a technologically static field that has not changed significantly since the 1970s, with minimal improvements in urinary tract infection risk, supply cost, and environmental waste reduction. While the associated SBIR Phase I project established proof-of-concept catheter reprocessing, the Phase II project will include optimization and more advanced microbiologic efficacy testing. This assessment will focus on specifically addressing concerns regarding lubrication and compactness brought up during SBIR Phase I customer discovery activities, as well as multiple reuse reprocessing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase access to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Over 554,000 kidney failure patients in the US require some form of dialysis each year but only 58,000 receive PD, despite its lower cost of care. Despite the many benefits and advantages of PD compared to in-center dialysis, adoption is limited due to the risk of peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneal membrane. Peritonitis occurs in nearly 30% of PD patients each year and is responsible for the death of 1 out of every 6 patients who receive PD. The proposed device significantly and broadly reduces the risk of peritonitis, resulting in nearly $2 billion in Medicare savings and improved clinical outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop a medical device that internally disinfects catheter tubes in a closed system. This innovative disinfection method is designed to prevent microbial infection threats during peritoneal dialysis. The aim will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disinfection prototype, including evaluations of its ease of use. The technology will be designed to meet medical device design and safety standards. The project will perform optimization studies, develop cGMP-ready manufacturing processes, and develop an advanced prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve capacitor technology in power conversion equipment used to electrify our transportation systems. Capacitors are critical components to the systems needed to accelerate the energy transition from petroleum to other fuels. This project will develop new electrical materials and production processes for capacitors. The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles. Through development of these new electrode materials and processes, manufacturing of capacitors in the United States will be available to serve the growing US electric vehicle industry.

    This goal of the proposed work is to develop electrode materials and roll-to-roll processes compatible with an integrated, continuous manufacturing process for multilayer capacitor products. By combining additive manufacturing process in a roll-to-roll system, sequential deposition, drying, and curing of alternating layers of dielectrics and electrodes will enable production of multilayer capacitors in a single system at atmospheric pressure. Electrode inks and printing processes used in flexible/hybrid electronics do not meet the specifications to replace vacuum-based evaporation or sputtering of thin electrode layers for capacitor applications. The primary approach will be based on adapting the layer coating and alignment techniques developed for dielectrics to conductive materials. These electrode materials will improve upon state-of-the-art conductive inks with poor interfaces between particles to produce dense layers with uniform thickness and low surface roughness. This project seeks to provide prototyping of multilayer capacitors produced in discrete processing steps for verification of electrical performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies ultimately in saving lives. This project proposes a Machine Learning-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) firearms detection system for law enforcement. Implementation of this technology would significantly reduce the cognitive burden of police officers in dangerous situations, allowing for more informed decisions. Additionally, there are benefits to the warfighter and security professionals to improve their capabilities in keeping the nation and public safe. Successful implementation and commercialization of a firearms detection system will grant capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data to find insights previously unknown, and to provide a data-driven approach towards real-time reactions around firearms and firearm usage.

    The proposed project aims to research and develop a Machine Learning-enabled, integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm activity, such as discharges and unholsters. The challenges are two-fold: 1) to develop and iterate based on pilot user feedback regarding the hardware and software portions of the system; and 2) to employ machine learning on a unique dataset for insights on firearms knowledge and handling. The proposed research and development plan calls for pilots with several law enforcement agencies, hardware and software iterations based on user feedback, and research into a real-life dataset collected by police officers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is addressing the critical societal need to remediate toxic organic pollutants in soils and sediments. The proposed technology would enable environmental goals to be met on many contaminated sites whose remediation is currently limited by high costs. The technology would contribute to the re-development of many billions of dollars in real estate by returning properties to productive and appropriate use. The hybrid bacterial augmentation and thermal technology provides a model for additional systems with other bacteria uniquely suited to applications in emerging contaminants and water treatment.

    This project proposes to commercialize a bacterial treatment for the degradation of organic contaminants of concern in environmental matrices such as soils and sediments. The thermally-enhanced bioaugmentation technology evaluated in Phase I is based on a novel bacterial strain and its enzymes that function at elevated temperatures and are capable of degrading a variety of ring based, organic pollutants, including chlorinated forms difficult to remediate. Pilot tests on soils contaminated with Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) demonstrated degradation for both TPH and for the heavier poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PaHs) on the EPA's list of priority pollutants. Phase II goals are to expand these initial studies to the full commercial scale of 100s to 1000s of tons of soil by working with established environmental engineering firms with extensive experience in thermal treatments of large volumes. To fully commercialize this new technology, the production capacity for the biological agents also will be scaled up by over an order of magnitude. The technology will be applied both ex-situ and in-situ as the process evolves.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide waste concrete as a new raw material source for the glass and other industries.  It is estimated that 2.2 billion tons of waste concrete is generated globally each year.  About 70% of the construction waste generated in the US is concrete, but it is not typically used as a raw material for glass production or other chemical processes.  Using concrete as a raw material reduces its contribution to landfills as well as the need for mining virgin raw materials., and contributes environmental benefits.  This STTR Phase I project will study processes to prepare furnace-ready concrete for glass production.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the feasibility of waste concrete as a raw material constituent (feedstock) for calcium-silicate glass and glass-making.  Environmental benefits are possible because concrete contains the same key oxides used in glass making (silicon, calcium, aluminum and iron oxides) as well as sulfur compounds (e.g. gypsum mixed with the cement to regulate setting, and therefore can potentially serve as a candidate raw material in the production of calcium-silicate soda lime and calcium-borosilicate glasses.Research objectives include: 1) characterize variations in chemical composition from industrially relevant sources; 2) determine variation in contaminant concentrations; 3) demonstrate processes and methods to address contaminant variations' 4) characterize the specifications for a furnace-ready waste concrete glass batch; 5) produce pilot batches of calcium-silicate soda lime glass; and 6) characterize variations in produced glasses.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the lab-on-a-chip and other related life science platforms by the introduction of a new standardized microfluidic chip interface. The proposed project advances a novel interface to advance the applications and capabilities of microfluidic chips in both medical and non-medical fields, including dramatically increasing the rate at which doctors and medical researchers can prepare and perform diagnostic tests. The interface enables easy interoperability of devices as the chips can be freely switched out while the result of the hardware remains the same. The success of this project could lead to great breakthroughs in bioenergy, medical diagnostics, and drug therapeutics.

    The proposed project undertakes the development of chip interfaces with reduced size and increased channel density by making use of novel interfacing and sealing methods, on a reusable micro-patterned surface. While the technology exists to fabricate microfluidic chips with much smaller dimensions, with more complex on-chip operations, and at a reduced cost, the current limitation is the size of the interfaces bridging the microscopic world of the fluid microchip with the macroscopic world of the laboratory. The work proposed herein could enable chips with 16x the density of sample channels, allowing for vastly more complex diagnostics to be performed and thereby vastly reducing the sample volume needed for accurate diagnostics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the success rates of cancer therapy, reduce the costs and duration of treatment, and to improve patients’ life quality. More than 70% of the 16 million Americans diagnosed with cancer will undergo ineffective chemotherapy cycles through trial-and-error methods. On average, a cycle of chemotherapy costs $30 k and takes 12 weeks to complete; cancer patients undergo 5-6 cycles at a cost of an estimated $180 k. This project advances a method to pre-screen response to chemotherapy drugs so that clinicians can select the most effective treatment, consequently shortening the duration, reducing complications, improving outcomes, and reducing the financial burden. The technology uses a quick, single-step, scalable, inexpensive, and automated process that tests a wide range of drugs in less than a week. With this technology, the oncologist will be able to select the most effective chemotherapy drug for a cancer patient, on an individualized basis and prior to initiating treatment. The proposed personalized approach would reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles to 1-2, and save up to $120 k per treatment, generating annual national savings of $18.2 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development, proof-of-concept validation, and preclinical evaluation of an automated biochip platform that grows patients’ cancer cells outside the body to screen them against chemotherapeutic drugs. In the research described herein, tumor specimens from patient biopsies will be grown and maintained as microtumors in the biochips to recapitulate clinical tumor behavior. The biochips and process will be optimized to create microtumors that can be used toward evaluating the performance of cancer treatment. Research objectives are to I) evaluate, refine, and optimize the design of the biochips through simulation studies to ensure compatibility with native tumor microstructure and mass transfer behavior; II) evaluate the formation, growth, and behavior of patient-derived microtumors in the biochips; and III) investigate the response of patient-derived microtumors to anti-cancer drugs in comparison to longitudinal clinical data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable the efficient emulation on classical computers of simulations carried out on quantum computing hardware. The proposed emulator technology is expected to address problems an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present using classical computing hardware. The emulator will be specifically designed for electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials. The successful completion of this project will disrupt the research and development associated with the use of quantum computing in the pharmaceutical and materials spaces by enabling faster assessment and development of quantum algorithms. Since it is widely accepted that these are impactful early applications of emerging quantum computing platforms, there is a paramount need for creating a user- and developer-friendly software stack specifically tailored for such simulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a quantum emulator on the basis of the so-called matrix-product-state (MPS) representation of fermionic wave functions. The innovation results from the fact that the proposed emulator will be specifically designed for fermions and therefore can take advantage of the physical symmetries inherent in these systems. The first-principles MPS wavefunction ansatz has been developed in the quantum chemistry community in the context of the ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) over the past two decades, and will be generalized such that the same APIs as used for the standard quantum emulator will be exposed to users. The proposed new software is expected to allow for emulation of quantum simulations involving 100 spin orbitals/50 electrons, or more, on commodity classical computing hardware, which is an order of magnitude larger than is possible at present. In this SBIR Phase I project, a Python prototype and associated command-line tools will be completed to demonstrate the technology and commercial viability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and commercialize an ocular gene therapy to reverse the effects of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting over 11 million Americans today and representing the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the United States. The proposed treatment has the potential to preserve independence, economic stability, and quality of life of those affected by AMD and reduce US healthcare costs with just a single treatment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project technical plan will optimize the formulation, dose, and route of administration of an investigational therapy in a large animal model. The project will first develop gene therapy formulations with various vehicles. The formulations’ efficiency in retinal tissues with an injection into the eye will be assessed with preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses. Toxicology studies will be performed to assess safety and efficacy of the novel formulation and the injection route at various doses over 3 months. Subsequently, the project will assess risk in manufacturing the gene delivery vehicles to ensure that high concentrations can be manufactured for future clinical use.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in transforming a ubiquitous source of water pollution into a renewable source of fertilizer, while facilitating onsite treatment and reuse of recycled greywater. This technological solution is intended to conserve precious drinking water supplies and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources for both wastewater treatment and fertilizer production. Rather than combining all domestic wastewater into one dilute stream, this project separates and recycles the largest source of nutrient pollution: toilet waste. Source-separating bathroom fixtures (including waterless urinals, urine-diverting toilets, and vacuum-flush toilets) direct the waste through dedicated plumbing to a compact building-scale processor, which converts it into a purified liquid fertilizer. This technology may have immediate utility in sensitive watersheds where regulations require landowners to remove nitrogen from wastewater, and in urban settings where municipalities are subsidizing or mandating distributed wastewater treatment because their central wastewater treatment facilities have reached or exceeded their design capacity. The technology may create jobs in installation and service, reduce loads on wastewater treatment plants, restore waterways, and yield clean, domestically-produced fertilizer for use in agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on developing a building-scale, high-strength, wastewater treatment system paired with source-separating bathroom fixtures to result in a resource recovery system. Nutrients are recovered from the influent wastewater through a four-stage treatment train that includes: (1) acidification to minimize pipe occlusion, (2) freeze concentration to reduce volume, (3) pasteurization to destroy pathogens, and (4) filtration to reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. The objective of this research project is to develop this technology to the point where it can be installed in a building and is capable of capturing greater than 90% of nutrients from 600 liters of wastewater per day with minimal energy inputs. This goal will require increasing the working volume of the current freeze concentrator, optimizing the energy usage of each element in the treatment train, packaging each element so that they are durable, readily installable, and easily maintained, and developing a fully automated control system. Each element of the treatment train will be tested individually to demonstrate that a consistent, concentrated, sanitized fertilizer can be produced from high-strength wastewater while decreasing building water demand.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for a healthy, sustainable built environment. Stringent environmental protection policies are presenting the building industry with challenges in reducing environmental impacts. High performing windows could play an role in reducing energy use and pollutant emissions. Creating a window system that reduces building energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may have broad societal, economic, and commercial impacts. The proposed biochromic windows can serve as an alternative, energy efficient retrofit and help meet net zero energy, net zero carbon buildings. Their multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits include high energy efficiency, improved air quality, carbon capture, and renewable energy production. Energy efficient window retrofitting accounts for over 60% of the global window market share. In 2021, the global window market grew to $10 billion for replacement and renovation and $6 billion for new construction with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. This energy efficient, carbon sink technology may result in 20~30% energy savings and carbon reductions. The good air quality further benefits occupant health and well-being, making the building more appealing to occupants, industry professionals, and stakeholders.

    The key technical innovation of the biochromic window is to integrate biological cells within a window assembly for commercial building retrofitting applications. As a primary building enclosure system mediating between indoor and outdoor environments, the biochromic window offers improved insulation, dynamic shading efficacy, daylight penetration, views to outside, carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation, and biomass production, all of which are attributes of improved building energy efficiency, good indoor air quality, beneficial carbon sequestration, novel biofuel production, and user satisfaction. The primary project objectives are to: 1) prototype of a biochromic window, integrated with an intelligent control system to enable the maximum performance; 2) conduct performance testing and obtain performance certificates; and 3) scale-up mass production manufacturing and carry out technology demonstrations at early adopter’s buildings. Project outcomes seek to save building energy consumption in heating, cooling, and artificial lighting load while producing on-site renewable energy and sequestrating CO2. The biochromic windows, coupled with an intelligent control system, further enhance economic and environmental performance depending on solar intensity and carbon concentration. The view-out area within the biochromic window admits year round daylighting. Proximity to green nature is expected to provide aesthetic quality and emotional comfort for user satisfactions.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project improves treatment of viral conditions, starting with influenza. Each year seasonal influenza infects 9–35 million individuals, causes 56,000 deaths in the U.S., and costs $87.1 billion.  The proposed technology has the potential to produce more rapid protection, expand pathogen/variant coverage, and extend the longevity of protection afforded by influenza vaccination and other vaccines. This added protection will reduce the high healthcare costs and productivity losses due to mortality/morbidity. This technology has the potential to serve as a rapidly deployable prophylactic or vaccine adjuvant to enhance protection and reduce the necessary vaccine dose, expanding access and providing a timelier response.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a next-generation vaccine adjuvant platform. While vaccines represent a major medical success, several diseases have proven difficult to address, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. One way to improve the efficacy of vaccines for these diseases is to use an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response to the antigen presented via vaccination. The proposed technology has the potential to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of infections directly and via heterologous immunity because the addition of “Stimulator of Interferon Genes” (STING) agonist overproduction to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) serves a dual purpose: it enhances the elevated trained immunity of macrophages already known to be conferred by BCG and promotes critical antiviral IFN-I responses. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Optimize media and lyophilization for manufacturing of BCG-STING; 2) Evaluate the immunological effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 influenza vaccination; and 3) Assess the protective effects of BCG-STING as an adjuvant for H1N1 vaccination. This will provide proof of concept for proceeding with the development of this novel recombinant BCG as an efficacy-boosting adjuvant that also offers intrinsic antiviral immunity.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to help manage environmental change in coastal cities. Currently, a gap exists in the coastal infrastructure community for an effective solution that supports ecological health and community-based co-benefits over traditional gray infrastructure, such as seawalls, berms, or structured fill. This project addresses that gap through a novel full-scale experimental implementation of a reliable and durable network of floating biomass-based modules for coastal protection. The proposed project develops a dynamic, detail-oriented scientific approach and technical modeling. This project will demonstrate how an interconnected, anchored network of vegetated biomass modules can dampen wave energy, absorb water pollutants, and create an engaging community space for coastal cities.

    The technical innovations of the proposed SBIR Phase II project are: (A) a new material engineering approach for seaworthy floating modules based on biomass and living plants, anchored in a hexagonal array and interconnected; (B) a full numerical predictive modeling suite to simulate biogeochemical effects, fluid dynamic network effects, and hydrodynamic effects of large such networks of modules; and (C) a fully functional prototype network to study physical behavior and effects. This project consists of five separate experimental objectives: (1) extensive unit prototyping, redesign and monitoring to assess manufacturer material and biological behavior over time, (2) ecological monitoring of individual unit and network impacts leading to the development of a predictive biogeochemical model, (3) translation of physical wave tank lab results into a predictive coastal environment simulation model, (4) hydrodynamic analysis of a full-scale experimental network prototype, and (5) development of technical methods for production and deployment at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project benefitd the 70 million people struggling with gait disorders in the US. Gait analysis monitors how individuals walk to predict or prevent injuries and track rehabilitation progress. Due to the potentially high equipment costs, space requirements, and required technical expertise to collect and interpret results, detailed gait analyses are limited to a few centers and mainly used for surgical decision-making.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for gait analysis at roughly 70% less than typical costs, as well as offering reduced set-up time and improved workflow efficiency.

    The proposed project will address the existing technological and commercial barriers that make gait analysis an exclusive clinical tool restricted to only 300 gait labs across the country.  This project will develop a cost-effective markerless motion 3D-tracking system. Technical activities include: (1) increase the motion database to a diverse population, including children and patients with mobility impairments; (2) improve the computer vision algorithms to account for multiple individuals within the camera system’s field of view; (3) integrate EMG and Force Plates; (4) implement skeletal geometry estimation from computed tomography; (5) develop a self-calibration system that can operate with HD low cost cameras; and (5) improve accuracy and usability substantially to reduce the expertise required for computational gait analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve the use of water for the oil and gas (O&G) industry, especially during hydraulic fracturing, transforming the industry into a producer of fresh water and changing produced water from its current status as a waste product to a commodity. The proposed technology creates two reusable products: purified water and heavy brine. In addition to the high cost, disposal of produced water through deep injection wells has recently been linked to seismic activity and may impact groundwater quality, prompting policy solutions.  The O&G industry competes with other water uses, especially in US arid regions where significant O&G production occurs. Produced water, contaminated with salts, hydrocarbons, and metals, is generated each year through O&G production, costing $37B to manage in the U.S. Current demand for global fresh water resources for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes is increasing, primarily due to reduction of water supplies in areas affected by drought, climate change, population growth, and expanding industries, as well as degradation of water quality due to contaminants from industry, flooding, or runoff.  The proposed project will provide a new treatment for water used in O&G production, creating a renewable source of fresh water from otherwise unusable wastewater or impacted water sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance the development of an innovative thermal distillation treatment system for produced water generated during O&G production. Current treatment technologies, like reverse osmosis, cannot handle the high-total dissolved solids (TDS) content of most produced water, and thus only a small portion may be reused currently. Disposal is generally through permitted deep injection wells, with water transportation typically serving as the largest disposal cost component. The proposed system accomplishes the entire thermal distillation process in one piece of equipment - a technological advance over state-of-practice thermal distillation units requiring separate energy sources, heat transfer, distillation, separation, and condensation units. It reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, and it uses less energy in operation.  The system can be set up on-site at the well, eliminating the need to transport produced water off-site for disposal. The proposed treatment process yields two reusable products: (1) purified water, which may be sold for use at the well site, sold for agriculture/industrial uses, or discharged to surface waters; and (2) heavy brine, which may be sold as a drilling fluid.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a cost-effective high-performance imaging technology with widespread commercial opportunities for industrial applications, such as autonomous navigation. The technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of autonomous navigation systems, enabling more precise detection of objects at further distances and enjoying greater robustness against environmental conditions. These capabilities help increase the safety of autonomous driving. The proposed technology is designed for manufacturability at low cost and high volume.  Applications will benefit the defense, industrial, medical and scientific sectors, potentially bringing new opportunities in the areas of surveillance, security, remote sensing, machine vision, material surface characterization, biomedical imaging, as well as novel areas such as quantum imaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a multi-pixel optical focal plane array (FPA) capable of coherent detection by leveraging photonic integrated circuit technology. Current conventional FPA technologies operate by direct photon detection wherein the incoming photons are converted into electron charges directly at each detection pixel. The measured signal is thus proportional to the intensity of the incident light.  However, coherent detection measures both intensity and phase, with advantages including near-shot-noise-limited performance, background light rejection, and additional object information contained in the phase. The proposed technology will enable thousands to millions of coherent detection pixels to be fabricated monolithically on a photonic chip, enabling mass production.  This research will result in a design of the coherent FPA with optimal detection performance and small form-factor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve detection and enable prediction of implantable device failure. The first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain’s ventricles. Hydrocephalus is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail at alarming rates (40% within the 1st year of use), leading first to nonspecific symptoms such as headaches and blurred vision and then to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. The proposed sensor module can be integrated with already-commercialized shunt systems and may allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health, ultimately improving clinical outcomes while reducing overall treatment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the integration of various microsensors to generate a diagnostic data set for data analytics. This data set will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on CSF dynamics over time. The system would include several first-to-market capabilities, including chronic repeated measurement of CSF dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and dissemination. The smart shunt system will enable remote, on-demand monitoring of shunt status, giving physicians the data necessary for timely diagnosis and prediction of shunt failure. At-home electronic shunt monitoring will allow physicians to quantitatively and proactively manage patients’ disease in real-time, and thereby improve their quality of life.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to improve the outcomes of patients suffering sudden cardiac arrest. Approximately 650,000 cardiac arrests occur each year, representing the top reason for mortality and morbidity in the US and an estimated $33 billion a year for out-of-hospital costs. Overall survival remains generally below 10%, and patients are often left with significant neurological injury. Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) still remains one of the most effective treatments, resulting in better outcomes than current technologies. This project will develop a novel medical device that provides a novel superior automated CPR therapeutic system. It combines multiple methods of mechanical chest compression to improve patient blood flow during resuscitation.

    This project will advance preclinical research for developing the first clinically effective noninvasive automated CPR device. The system integrates a multimodal approach for delivering mechanical CPR, and therefore represents a significant advancement to current systems that only deliver a single mode of CPR. The automated and programmable prototype will determine the optimal combination of methods and timing, to control multiple pump mechanisms for applying mechanical chest compressions to improve patient outcomes. This Phase I project will conduct optimization studies in a swine model of cardiac arrest and develop a proof-of-concept model. These results will provide the foundation for the next generation system suitable for human use, as well as advance research results on the hemodynamic interactions of pump mechanisms and cardiac electrophysiology during CPR.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will lead to the development of engineered neutralizing antibodies for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that can be used as therapeutic agents to diminish the severity of a COVID-19 infection and decrease the chances of hospitalization and progressive disease. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate it is necessary to increase collective preparedness by generating a wide collection of neutralizing antibodies that individually provide coverage for a range of variants (Delta, Beta, Omicron). These antibodies, when administered as an antibody cocktail, may offer broad protection over a diverse population of variants. This project’s approach generates neutralizing antibodies that are specifically engineered to bind to different regions of the spike protein thereby increasing the probability that one or more of the engineered antibodies will be effective against future mutated versions of the virus. The proposed combination of high-throughput screening, next-generation-sequencing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based antibody design allows systematic exploration of vast ranges of antibody sequences. This approach also has the benefit of engineering antibodies that are more potent, easier to administer, more stable under challenging environmental conditions, and less costly to manufacture, leading to therapeutics that can be more readily distributed to low-income countries.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to enable AI and machine learning antibody engineering approaches by providing needed antibody sequence mutation binding data. Currently available antibody datasets number in the thousands of datapoints and the team proposes to generate datasets that number in the tens of millions. The project will also be generating both positive and negative antibody binding data, potentially leading to higher performing learned antibody binding models. This project seeks to test the hypothesis that synthetic antibodies can be the equal of, or better than, naturally occurring antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This approach could potentially develop a wide range of antibody variations. The application of this AI-based antibody engineering will be focused on discovering a large array of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple, different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the combination of yeast-display, high-throughput fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and next generation sequencing. Combining these high-throughput data generation workflows with the latest deep neural networks may lead to a new methodology that can efficiently discover high performing antibodies for the current pandemic and those in the future.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to improve education and experiential learning.  The proposed tool will support both synchronous and asynchronous learning while providing students with the opportunity to engage independently and connect their learning to internships, job shadows, service projects, and other real-world learning experiences. This project will enhance teacher capacity to guide and assess student learning, increase transparency and objectivity in assessment, and expand the learning ecosystem of schools by empowering students to engage in and validate authentic, real-world learning experience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel competency-based evaluation tool and learner recommendation engine designed to: assess a range of currently needed skills and competencies, aggregate assessment data for the purpose of generating a comprehensive learner record in real time, and generate personalized competency pathways and recommendations for learning and growth. The key intellectual merits of this proposal are the formulas used to aggregate assessment data over time and the algorithms used to generate personalized competency pathways and learner recommendations. The technical challenges are the development and testing of the associated algorithms to guide and evaluate learning in both academic and authentic, real-world contexts. Research conducted during this Phase I project enable testing and refining of the data aggregation formulas utilized by the assessment tool, as well as optimization of the learner recommendation algorithms used for the creation of personalized competency pathways.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve cancer treatment. This project advances a new therapy that targets cancer cells and addresses their malignancies.  Following the initial application of lymphomas, the results obtained herein can be applied to several types of cancer.

    The proposed project will generate Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies to improve treatment for lymphomas.  Currently, these therapies show negative effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and metabolic exhaustion upon reaching the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, low nutrient availability for CAR cells in the tumor microenvironment decreases the efficacy. Therefore, strategies utilizing CAR therapy to help target the tumors and keep these cells sufficiently metabolically fit to perform their functions are beneficial.  The main goal of this project is to test the feasibility of generating biomaterials that maintain activation of immune cells in resource-poor environments. This project will generate CAR-macrophages and test the ability of our biomaterials to maintain metabolic fitness in these cells. Technical activities include: (1) Generate human CAR macrophages using non-viral electroporation, (2) Show proof-of-concept that human CAR macrophages can survive in a resource-poor environment, and (3) Show proof-of-concept that mouse CAR macrophages do not induce toxicity in vivo in mice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a synthetic lung surfactant product for the potential treatment of serious respiratory illnesses in neonatal patients.  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia affects 10,000-15,000 pre-term infants per year and has a high mortality rate. Exposure of immature lung tissue to air results in inflammation and damages lungs and airways. Decreasing  bronchopulmonary dysplasia is anticipated to reduce the number of days infants spend in the hospital, the need for supplemental oxygen, and other burdens on the healthcare system. The average length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is currently 103 days.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project may result in the formulation of synthetic proteins for a bioengineered lung surfactant that contains full-length critical phospholipids and anti-inflammatory agents. Currently, bioengineered pulmonary surfactants are not as effective as animal-derived pulmonary surfactants for the treatment of illnesses related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The synthesis of full-length, native surfactant proteins has yet to be achieved. This research seeks to synthesize proteins which may add significant viscoelasticity to the pulmonary surfactant. The protein will be combined with major surfactant phospholipids and anti-inflammatory therapeutics at defined ratios to potentially generate fully-synthetic pulmonary surfactant preparations with anti-inflammatory properties. These surfactant formulations will be screened in vitro and in vivo using a neonatal rat hyperoxia model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a sustainable fashion.  The proposed system can manage MSW without generating toxic air emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 98% compared to landfills and incineration. An additional benefit is that waste does not need to be separated, thereby promoting recycling of glass and metal, as they are left untreated.  In addition, the technology is envisioned to be  affordable and easily deployed to enable on-site treatment, saving transportation costs and associated impact. Finally, the system has the potential to use excess heat to generate electricity and use the by-product effectively. This system promotes a circular economy and supports multiple benefits to the environment.

    This project advances development of a novel system of applying gas plasma to create thermal degradation of MSW.  Phase I objectives are to research, design, construct, and test a prototype and define an industrial-scale design. Tasks include testing functionality and emissions quality with a variety of waste feedstock and operational parameters, and conducting a life cycle analysis. Furthermore, the project will explore the co-generation of electricity and beneficial reuse of the ash by-product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing social enterprises with software that performs social-impact forecasting and tracking using machine learning, computer simulation, and data visualization. These digital tools provide social enterprises with better visibility into where their resources can be invested for maximum impact. The adoption of quantitative data analysis has made commercial enterprises more formidable, but these tools are slow in coming to the $7 trillion world of non-profits, charitable foundations, international development agencies, impact investors, and government agencies. The software informs investment strategies by providing a quantitative estimate of impact-per-dollar. The software will also track the ongoing social impact of each resource allocation, enabling social enterprises to iteratively adapt and improve the efficacy of their operations, and provide more accountability to their funding sources. These software tools can help address some of the most vexing societal concerns than span health, sustainability, poverty, and access to education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project makes use of software data analysis tools including Agent Based Modeling (ABM), machine learning (such as Gradient Boosted Machines and Artificial Neural Networks), and Interactive Data Visualization. Agent Based Modeling involves building a digital simulation of the target ecosystem, capturing the essential actors and behaviors. For example, for the opioid epidemic, this may be the addicts/drugs/doctors/pharma agents, along with their attributes, histories, and interactions with each other. This modeling allows simulation of intervention scenarios and quantification of outcomes. Machine learning techniques, once trained and calibrated with past data on the target ecosystem, provide forecasting and allow the exploration of what-if scenarios. A bottom-up model is built for each target social issue, shared by relevant social enterprises, and calibrated using their collective data and subject matter experts.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce injuries and costs due to overexertion and heat strain in firefighting through a real-time, biometric monitoring system and accompanying analysis tools. This system collects each firefighter's vital signs and sends the data to authorized commanders for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, commanders can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Almost 60% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year, and associated costs total over $7 billion annually.  The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve other first responders, such as military personnel, industrial workers, and others with occupational risk.

    The proposed project will improve the occupational safety of first responders through the research and development of the following components:  1) An improved biometric collection wearable; 2) software used by the biometric monitoring system; 3) a location-monitoring tool; 4) algorithms to estimate sleep quality, fatigue, and detect symptoms for certain diseases, and improve exertion and core-body temperature estimates. 5) network improvement solutions allowing first responders in remote areas to utilize biometric monitoring tools. All five objectives will consist of multiple pilot studies with ongoing research and development that will incorporate crucial feedback from end-users. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for partnering fire and emergency services.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop low-cost, low-power, wireless sensor networks with long lifetimes for high density deployments in the field, primarily for precision agriculture. Existing solutions in the market consist of sensor modules with bulky batteries and repeaters driven by solar panels which drive up the cost.  These batteries and repeaters are infeasible for large-scale deployments. This project aims to provide sustainable solutions to increase the accuracy and efficiency of agricultural operations, while maximizing the crop yields and minimizing operational costs. The proposed sensor networks may also serve as a solution for military surveillance in the field, forest-fire prediction/mitigation, and smart highways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the use of wake-up receivers for radiofrequency (RF) communications, while also using the RF communications for moisture sensing. This use of wake-up receivers and RF-based sensing brings down the size and cost of the nodes and enables mesh networking. The research objectives of the project include both evaluation of such a network and the determination of the feasibility and reliability of wireless sensor nodes deployed inside the soil across varying soil conditions and permittivity variations. The outcome of the experiments will be a set of specifications for integrated circuits (ICs) and networks required for a dense network deployment in precision agriculture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to empower brain scientists with a high-resolution optical imaging instrument to reach currently inaccessible regions of the brain with minimal damage. The instrument contains thin fiber optics probes that enable access to very narrow cavities within the body or penetration of tissue. Deep brain imaging, photo-stimulation, and photo-ablation are possible applications, all of which could help understand brain function and potentially unlock treatments for brain diseases. The imaging instrument to be developed in this project may be amenable to scientific studies in animal models, addressing the need of neuroscientists and imaging facilities. The proposed technology could bring about innovations in biophotonics instrumentation as well as in the ensuing biomedical applications.  The project seeks to advance novel imaging technologies with broad applicability addressing a new segment in the endoscopy market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a critical need in scientific brain imaging studies for endoscopes that are minimally invasive with a diameter in the order of 100 microns, which represents a cross-area about 10 times smaller than the thinnest existing endoscopes. While current endoscopes are appropriate for insertion in large cavities, their size produces excessive damage in brain imaging applications. The objective is to develop a new class of fundamentally less invasive techniques to investigate novel imaging probes, and to validate a prototype instrument in animal models. It is anticipated that in-vivo imaging of neurons with subcellular resolution at depth will become routine with minimal tissue damage. This novel imaging approach implements wavefront shaping in multimode fibers, using advanced machine learning and signal processing methods, to generate arbitrary digitally-reprogrammable light patterns and 3D images. The ultrathin endomicroscope (UTE) uses a spatial light modulator to first calibrate the fiber and then scan light at high speed, compensating for the inherent modal dispersion and intermodal coupling.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to ease the burden on early childhood teachers and ensure they have the information needed to support children’s learning. COVID-19 has upended the lives of millions of children and families and disproportionately affected low-income children. The incoming class of preschoolers have increasingly variable levels of development and skills than ever before, and educators need to assess their need and help them to catch up academically. The industry leading tools in early childhood assessment rely solely on observation-based assessment, in which teachers make judgments about a child’s performance based on observations made in the classroom. Observation-based measures have limitations, including time burden, teacher bias, and variability in scoring due to differences in teacher education and training. Observational assessment is especially challenging in the remote context, since teachers were not able to physically monitor children’s development. Even when children are back in the classroom, face masks may shield some of the more subtle cues around learning and development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to ensure an accurate assessment of child development, so that teachers can leverage the data for tailored instruction to help children catch up from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Child assessments are typically observational or direct. This Phase II project collects both observational and direct data, providing an opportunity to compare the data and help teachers understand areas where there may be assessment error due to teacher bias or other factors. At the end of Phase II, it is anticipated that teachers will have access to a self-led teacher training and reliability certification, which may help to ensure a more consistent assessment experience in the classroom. Moreover, educational programs will have access to an assessment quality monitoring dashboard that seeks to highlight differences between observation and game-based assessment scores and provide a path towards reconciliation. Educational programs may be able to customize this technology to fit the needs of English language learners, who are often subject to assessor bias. Finally, teachers may be able to leverage the game-based assessments to understand both academic and “soft” skill development. Overall, the technology may\provide teachers with a robust child assessment system that helps them to accurately and efficiently assess whole child development.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the reduction of food waste and improved nutrition. Each year, more than 30% of fresh produce is wasted. The value of this wasted produce is estimated at more than $60 billion globally. This project’s main goal is to extend the shelf life of perishable foods with an edible coating that regulates the rate of both transpiration to slow moisture loss and respiration to delay ripening. The project aims to enable produce growers and distributors to preserve the freshness and quality of fruits and vegetables. Consumers could benefit by having access to fresher, tastier, and more appealing produce. This technology may also promote healthier food choices, especially in currently underserved food deserts. Packers would benefit by being able to offer a high-quality product that will last longer and that can better withstand the rigors of various types of transport. Extended shelf life also extends the market reach of U.S. exports in global markets.

    The core innovation underlying this project is the creation of stable Zein colloids that employ only edible, plant-based ingredients, are non-flammable, non-corrosive, and meet most global food regulations. These colloids will be initially developed as coatings for fresh whole or minimally processed foods, root crops, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.  The coating will not impede the delivery of nutrients, flavors, and other functional ingredients that make foods appealing, improve their quality, and encourage consumption.  The technology will also reduce food spoilage and improving food safety. Experimental work will be focused on further improving the stability of Zein dispersions and demonstrating the ability to adjust the film properties (water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide permeances) to respond to the physiology of a broad range of crops. This technology will also be piloted at various packing plants to evaluate its operational fitness with existing operations. This research will also enable related applications, such as for compostable coatings on food packaging and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to proactively identify and resolve mental health issues for children ages 10 - 18 before treatments and consequences become more acute and significantly more costly. This project innovation proposes bringing care to children at the onset of need using chatbot companions tailored deliberately and precisely to each child’s mental healthcare needs. Optionally, a child can be paired with live chat therapists and coaches no matter where the child is — at home, school, or when on their own. The system leverages proven mobile device-accessed Cognitive Behavioral Therapies in tandem with machine learning (ML)-enabled technologies that learn from a variety of interactions with the child to detect and digitally triage their experiences of loneliness, anger, anxiety, and depression and to alert adults when intervention and treatment are deemed necessary. Without appropriate care, these symptoms frequently increase in severity over time and become more difficult to treat.  Intervening early can help slow or halt mental illness, reducing for parents, schools, and society the practical and financial burdens associated with reactive, generalized mental healthcare treatments while nurturing children into happier, healthier adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to build a system to determine the nature and severity of a child’s mental health needs through real-time, early detection. Research reveals children face more barriers than adults when obtaining mental healthcare, especially in rural, marginalized, and low-socioeconomic-status communities. Due to a severe shortage of child behavioral health practitioners across the country, children frequently wait up to a decade between the onset of mental health symptoms and treatment. This project seeks to eliminate the delay between when children first experience mental or emotional needs and when they receive appropriate care, ensuring they flourish—not flounder—during those crucial developmental years. Leveraging ML algorithms and proprietary question weighting, the project focuses on: 1) algorithm development to determine the most effective combination of chatbot and live chat counselor engagements to understand a child’s immediate issues and provide resolutions for the child and their parent(s); 2) improvements to ensure the responses are fit for purpose, recognizing and flagging appropriate conversations for human interaction; and 3) refining the frequency and content of notifications; such as, adaptive motivational messages and recommendations to counselors for tailoring interactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the novel scientific knowledge gained by understanding the effects of high electrostatic fields on composite dielectrics, the translation of experimental materials to robust and high performance HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators, and, more generally, the impact of HASEL actuation technology within real-world applications. This knowledge contributes to many highly interdisciplinary fields of science, ranging from electrostatics, materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The advancements of HASEL actuators achieved during this project may have broad impacts on commercial, research, education, and defense sectors. These actuators may be an enabling component for a variety of industries including automation, automotive, medical devices, robotics, and defense applications. Key features of HASEL actuators include: analog motion, mechanical compliance, high speed, high strain, silent operation, customization, and self-sensing. By bringing forward actuator technologies, industries may adopt robotic technologies, strengthening the economic competitive advantage of these industries. The team will continue to leverage academic partnerships to contribute to and train a highly capable technical workforce of scientists and engineers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the performance of HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators. HASEL actuators harness electrostatic forces to drive shape-change in a soft hydraulic structure, providing a variety of muscle-like actuation modes and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. HASEL actuators address critical problems in existing soft actuator technologies. For example, soft pneumatic actuators must be tethered to a system of valves and pumps for high performance actuation, whereas HASEL actuators are electrically controlled and can be operated with battery-powered portable power supplies. The team will develop and validate approaches to advance the performance and ease of use of HASEL actuators. These advances of the technology will be realized through material optimization, fabrication improvements, and a more fundamental understanding of solid-liquid composite dielectric structures under high electrostatic fields. Performance improvements will be applied to actuators well-suited for industrial, consumer, defense, and experimental applications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a platform technology for creating rapid virus diagnostics that directly recognizes the virus surface protein pattern from a patient sample and generates accurate results within minutes. Current standards for high-fidelity viral pathogen diagnostics require complex instruments, technical expertise to run the instruments, and  hours to produce and interpret results. The proposed platform creates a virus-specific biosensor that selectively binds to the target virus and produces visible results without time-consuming pre-processing or expensive instruments. Lower cost tests and faster sample-to-result turnovers could result in more effective control of disease spread.

    This project seeks to develop a highly functional, sensitive, and specific diagnostic for the detection of coronavirus. This technology is based on the company’s Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The solution is a first-in-class diagnostics that uses algorithmically-designed structural DNA to form a trap that may detect and selectively bind a signature pattern of the pathogen. This recognition and binding may generate visual signals without the need of DNA/RNA preprocessing or amplification associated with the current generation of molecular tests (polymerase chain reactions, PCRs). This project will involve building a preclinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral flow based COVID-19 rapid diagnostics with a goal of providing results for each sample within 5 minutes.  This fast test result will be followed by preclinical validation to determine the test’s specificity, limits of detection, and implement mechanism to improve the assay specificity and to avoid cross-reaction to other virus types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide a more economical, scalable, and sustainable type of battery for storing the energy needed to support America’s growing renewable power grid. As more wind and solar power generation is being installed, there is a growing need for economical forms of energy storage to supply power during windless and sunless times. Older technologies like lithium ion and lead acid batteries are not ideal for this purpose due to problems with supply, safety, longevity, and sustainability. This project seeks to produce new chemical components to enable grid-scale batteries based on recyclable zinc metal, which offers a safer and more sustainable alternative grid-scale battery option. Furthermore, since zinc and its other battery components are sourced in the US, this project may help facilitate domestic battery manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign battery supplies.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to produce chemical additives that make zinc-bromine batteries last longer, hold more energy, and run more efficiently so that they can provide sustainable low-cost energy storage for renewable power. Presently, the major problems with these types of batteries are related to unwanted electrochemical side reactions that happen during battery charging. This project will eliminate these side reactions with stable, scalable, organic electrolyte additives designed to prevent problems at the zinc surface.  During this phase of the project, these electrolyte addititives will be modified and optimized for performance and scalability. They will be evaluated via testing in actual cells and full-size batteries by the battery manufacturers. By the end of the project, new class of enabling electrolyte may be available in large quantities to help establish safe, sustainable, domestically made zinc-bromine batteries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve distal extremity joint arthroplasty.  Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure to restore the function of a joint.  The proposed technology replaces cold knife, electrocautery, orthopedic saws and drills with a hand-held, all-tissue laser ablation system that fast cuts bone without necrosis. The effect is to reduce surgical time, create more precise cuts and drill holes, decrease recovery times, and reduce the need for opioid medications after surgery. The integrated visualization system may allow orthopedic surgeons to perform precise surgical planning that is difficult or impossible with current methods. While important in hips or knees, surgical precision is critical in wrists, ankles, and fingers/toes. The proposed device produced in this project may improve surgical success rates and reduce complications and revision surgeries, which will reduce patient suffering and excess healthcare costs. At the same time, the proposed tools may enable safe and successful distal extremity joint arthroplasty to be performed routinely.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an all-tissue laser-based orthopedic surgery system that integrates cameras for real-time, three-dimensional (3D) vision within a single handpiece. Conventional saws and drills compress and shear bones, causing postoperative joint pain and prolonging recovery times. A laser cuts by ablating tissue at its specific molecular absorption without killing the surrounding tissue (i.e., necrosis). One critical technical innovation in this project is to use a pulsed, high peak power, 9.3 μm wavelength carbon dioxide (CO2) laser that rapidly ablates hydroxyapatite (bone) and water (soft tissue). The laser pulse widths are chosen to approach the tissue’s Thermal Relaxation Time, TRT, which eliminates necrosis. Another critical technical innovation is to integrate various cameras (similar to smartphone and confocal microscope cameras) within the 9.3 μm ablation laser pulse train to provide real-time, high-definition, intraoperative vision. The proposed device may be enhanced to demonstrate sufficiently large bone ablation patterns, clinically acceptable bone ablation speeds, and non-tapered laser drilling tapering. The instrument will be housed in a handheld device that mimics existing orthopedic tools and will be run by firmware to perform at speeds necessary for clinical use.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital imaging in dentistry.\
    \ The goal is to create an imaging device to assist dentists when they assess\
    \ gingival health. This project uses ultrasound in contrast to the X-rays typically\
    \ used in dental imaging. The project impact will be a decreased overall radiation\
    \ dose to both patients and oral health professionals as well as high-resolution\
    \ imaging details on the soft tissue (gums). Details on the gingiva is often difficult\
    \ or impossible to obtain with X-ray imaging. The impact of commercialization\
    \ will include improved patient satisfaction as well as faster and better treatment\
    \ outcomes. Oral health professionals will be able to treat more patients per\
    \ unit time. This ultrasound-based approach will also offer early detection of\
    \ periodontitis to reduce the high cost of treatment associated with advanced\
    \ periodontal disease.  This device will reduce the risk of advanced periodontitis\
    \ and tooth loss and thus improve patient quality of life. Other broader impacts\
    \ include new insights into miniaturizing imaging equipment and processing imaging\
    \ data: These insights will improve acoustic imaging in areas well beyond the\
    \ mouth. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project offers\
    \ creative ideas to improve oral healthcare. The gold standard in dentistry is\
    \ physical inspection and X-ray imaging. This project will take advances in ultrasound\
    \ and integrate them into oral health. Ultrasound is ideally suited to image the\
    \ gingiva where gum disease resides and leads to tooth loss. The first objective\
    \ of the project will use creative strategies to miniaturize the size of the imaging\
    \ equipment. This miniaturization is important in order to access all teeth in\
    \ the mouth—conventional ultrasound imaging equipment can only access the incisors\
    \ and canines. The second objective is the development of novel algorithms to\
    \ automate image collection and image analysis. The software resulting from this\
    \ project will document dental health and track it over time. The software will\
    \ give clinicians detailed information about teeth and gums for diagnosis, prognosis,\
    \ risk assessment, and treatment planning. The ultimate technical result will\
    \ be an integrated device for acoustic imaging of the entire mouth that automatically\
    \ processes the imaging data.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient’s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient’s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients’ mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project’s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project’s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence/machinge learning (AI/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient’s future cognitive function.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to facilitate the blue economy’s continued transition to a big-data paradigm. Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation. The project enables adaptability by using an advanced control model methodology which adjusts the device hardware based on ambient environmental conditions for optimized performance. Due to the deployment environment, this project will capture training data under a laboratory setting, train the control model offline, and apply it in the field by leveraging edge computing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is potential commercial development of superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits with the ability to enable true biological brain-inspired deep neural network circuit algorithms and to improve efficiency, speed, and scalability of NC by orders of magnitude. The knowledge and approaches developed through this effort may help advance the foundational development of next generation computing hardware, helping NC continue its advance toward broad market adoption, and helping the US maintain its position as a leader in processor development and production. Additionally, the integrated synthesis-characterization-application approach can be extended to a range of applications, including sensors, metamaterials, catalysis, and renewables, which require atomic-scale control of materials and interfaces. Finally, through a partnership with University of Kansas, the project will facilitate university technology transfer and will serve to educate the next generation of materials and advanced electronics scientists and engineers. The atomic-to-nanoscale design, fabrication, characterization, and application experience will not only assist in recruiting top-quality students and provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel superconducting neuromorphic computing (NC) circuits consisting of atomically tunable memristors (synapses) with superconductor interconnects and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs, neurons). This superconducting NC circuit aims to enable true biological brain-inspired deep network circuit algorithms and to achieve currently unattainable levels of energy efficiency, switching speed, and scalability in NC.  The proposed research will design, fabricate, and characterize superconducting memristor-SQUID NC circuit hardware including development of the corresponding algorithms for pattern recognition, with machine learning capabilities, using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database to prove viability. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is illustrated in: (1) novel, atomically-tunable memristors with 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic range in the on/off ratio and switching frequency that can enable spikes of different amplitudes and frequencies as demanded for emerging deep circuits, (2) SQUID neurons with very high sensitivity and low noise, and (3) neurons and interconnects that can significantly reduce power consumption by eliminating the parasitic wire resistance that, in current NC circuits, increases substantially with circuit scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions in order to make infrastructure and operational decisions. This decision-making capability is important as many facilities spend millions of dollars each year on improving sewer system function, yet are constrained by lack of quality data on sewer flows. Improved sewer flow data may help to optimize infrastructure improvements and reduce costs to taxpayers. In addition, this work may directly advance the health and welfare of the American public through improved wastewater collection systems operations and reduced overflows and basement backups. This technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to advance a novel, non-contact sensor that collects video of wastewater flow in sanitary sewer systems to measure flow rate and detect critical sewer events. Specifically, the technology collects video of sanitary sewer flows and processes it in real time using a machine learning algorithm to measure the velocity and water level of the flow. This technology also evaluates images of sewer flows to identify illicit discharges into the system. Several key technical hurdles crucial to successful commercialization of this innovation will be addressed in the proposed project, including the use of artificial illumination systems in closed pipe environments, the development of strategies to account for rapid variations in flow rates, and the development of data analytic methods to identify critical sewer events. Given these technical hurdles, the objectives of this project will be to develop a video-based flow sensor that can accurately capture velocity and water level under expected environmental conditions and to analyze data from the proposed sensor to accurately identify critical sewer events such as blockages and illicit discharges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may enable the generation of as much as 65% of a building’s energy needs from renewable heating and cooling, reducing consumption by 13 Quads and saving consumers potentially billions of dollars. Buildings account for 28% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide and at least 2/3 of these structures will still exist in the year 2040. Achieving significant energy coset reductions will require a retrofit solution that is competitive with natural gas and grid-powered heating and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Such a retrofit must also be easily deployed in a wide variety of building types and architectures. The technology under development is a roof-mounted, panelized array that provides solar heat during the day and radiatively cools at night. The technology may be able to supply building energy resources throughout the year, a disruptive capability for a rooftop clean energy solution. The low cost and renewable nature of this resource may also insure that building owners and residents have access to carbon-free energy that is less expensive, less volatile, and more resilient in the face of interruptions to energy supplied from conventional gas and grid sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to validate a panelized rooftop technology to renewably generate heating and cooling resources for buildings. Dominant solutions combust fuel for heat and use grid electricity to power vapor compression for cooling. The proposed solution describes an array of thermal panes that convert a roof into an active environmental interface that continually optimizes the extraction and rejection of heat via absorptive, radiative, and convective processes. The technology continually operates in response to building energy needs. By modulating pane thermo-optic properties the solution enables fluid flow to alter the internal optical and heat transfer configuration. Evaluation of the technology will begin with manufacturing prototypes that incorporate novel thermal bonding techniques for integrating foamed polyiso-, fluoro-, and poly-olefin polymers. A solar simulator will assess efficiency and output temperatures, an iterative process to explore the role of internal fluid flows, visble and infrared radiation paths, and thermal loss mechanisms. An array will be subsequently deployed on a rooftop and coupled to the building energy system. Data will be collected to assess the impact on energy consumption and overall heating/cooling while developing control algorithms for pane modulation.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a visuospatial educational assessment tool.  Visuospatial aptitude is a facet of intelligence that underlies innovative thinking, i.e., how do new ideas emerge? and What are the physiological processes involved? Today, there is an overwhelming exposure within society to digital visual stimuli and national assessment authorities acknowledge visuospatial abstract reasoning as an accepted and sought after cognitive ability. Future curriculum designs must develop along with how people are changing and perceiving knowledge. This project seeks to set standards in education on visuospatial ability by introducing a novel assessment. This visuospatial assessment tool will utilize a software platform that allows customers to take the assessment online, and has commercial potential to improve industry, science, and educational programs for the advancement of human communication.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the development of an information technology consisting of a visuospatial ability assessment for measuring the biological processes that are required for being creative. Humans are biologically predisposed both to perceive and to reproduce symmetry, mainly in visual form, but also aurally; This proposed visuospatial assessment tool measures some of the biological processes that are required for the perception and reproduction of symmetry. Specifically, this assessment measures a form of sensorimotor perceptual action referred to in this project as ‘affective symmetry gauging’ (ASG). ASG consists of a subject’s innate visual perception/identification of the division in extreme and mean ratio point (DEMR; i.e., the symmetry point) in a given pattern. Because this process measures the extent to which a subject can perceive/identify and reproduce the symmetry point in given patterns, the tool also suggests the degree to which a subject may be inclined to reproduce symmetry, marking this inclination as a natural human expression of creativity aligned to pleasingness.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable one million Americans that suffer with the loss of ability to speak through disease of or damage to the larynx or mouth (aphonia). The inability to fluently communicate with other people has severe consequences. Voiceless individuals are three times more likely to suffer a preventable adverse event in medical settings than speaking patients, and this can lead to health problems and even life-threatening situations. Up to 50% of these adverse events could be avoided with adequate communication between patients and clinicians. The proposed solution is a video-to-speech software application that provides voiceless people with real-time communication assistance, especially geared towards medical settings. The technology could help prevent hundreds of thousands of adverse health events each year (costing $6.8 billion annually), with benefits for the voiceless population and the healthcare system in general. The innovation may improve voice restoration by providing real-time translation with no training needed and allowing complex messages to be expressed while looking eye-to-eye (an important part of human communication). Moreover, the technology does not require invasive installations nor complex equipment, is readily accessible, and has maintenance requirements that are marginal.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the intellectual challenge of overcoming the ambiguity of visemes when trying to automate lip-reading. Visemes (the gestures made when talking) and phonemes (the sounds produced with these gestures) do not share a one-to-one correspondence. This makes accurately predicting the intended speech based on visual information challenging. Previous researchers have failed to reach acceptable accuracy levels in the interpretation of visemes, while other tools only work with a few dozen words that must be structured according to pre-defined, fixed rules that are impractical. The main goal of this effort is to develop a combination of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network transducers that is capable of accurately differentiating visemes and permits real-time, reliable voice assistance for voiceless people. Project objectives include: (1) pre-training an algorithm to detect phonemes using publicly available speech video, (2) optimizing the phoneme-trained algorithm against healthcare relevant vocabulary, and (3) alpha-testing of the lip-reading algorithm against real-time speech.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic. Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep, insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10 Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an innovation in sleep therapy.  Approximately half of all American adolescents and young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression, and suicide.  The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively advance teenagers’ circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities. This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better sleep hygiene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in its ability to use machine learning and wearable technology to reduce uncontrolled destructive episodees, known as meltdowns, in children with autism. Meltdowns are highly distressing events for these children and their families and may require intervention on behalf of emergency response personnel and healthcare providers. Treating individuals with autism by proactively detecting meltdowns will allow caregivers time to intervene, mitigate, and prevent the onset of destructive behavioral episodes. The ability to predict a meltdown, and then implement strategic intervention to prevent the meltdown, may have positive life-changing effects for the children, their families, and their caretakes by reducing social stigma, enabling more mainstreaming of school and family activities, and reducing significant financial healthcare burdens. This technology may also be used to mitigate panic attacks in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a wearable device that detects, predicts, and helps prevent meltdowns in children with autism. Wearable devices that measure physiological parameters are available in the market, but none of them are specific to autism, and none of them proactively predict behavior episodes. A unique feature of this wearable device is that it uses machine learning to predict meltdowns. Incorporating machine learning allows each device to learn the unique biometric signature of the wearer so it can predict meltdowns with high accuracy. When a child is at high risk for a meltdown, the device will detect the relevant physiology and alert caregivers and therapists in time to intervene. The objectives of this project are to create a prototype which includes the wearable product and the individualization enabled by machine learning to correlate a child’s biometric measures with behavioral states. The goal is to achieve decreased frequency and/or severity of meltdowns. By enabling caregivers of children with autism to take control of and prevent meltdowns, this project has the potential to eliminate the stigma these children face during a meltdown in public, and empowers the children to become more independent as they age.

    \ by 2035. In a rapidly changing civilization, one cannot predict which professions\
    \ and skills will disappear in the next decades and which new ones will emerge.\
    \ This makes an individual’s existing skill level less informative than their\
    \ potential to acquire new skills. Unlike existing assessment methods, which focus\
    \ on finding already skilled individuals, this project will help identify those\
    \ better at obtaining new skills.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\
    \ Phase I project will create an assessment algorithm as well as an online testing\
    \ platform to address the current lack of fairness and equity in high-stakes cognitive\
    \ and educational assessments. This will be accomplished by combining two innovations:\
    \ (i) measuring the growth of learning capabilities directly during an educational\
    \ intervention without separation into pre-test, post-test, and training phases;\
    \ and (ii) maximizing the rate of change of a student’s cognitive capabilities\
    \ by applying adaptive item selection and personalized feedback. These two innovations\
    \ will maximize both the effect of intervention and the accuracy of its measurement.\
    \ As a result, learning capability can be measured in a single relatively short\
    \ session comparable to the time typically allocated for standardized testing.\
    \ The Phase I goals of this proposal are (i) demonstration of feasibility of extracting\
    \ learning capabilities, (ii) increased signal-to-noise ratio, and (iii) elimination\
    \ of the imbalance in initial proficiency levels.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help hospitals improve their sterile processing departments (SPD), where decontamination, sterilization, and assembly of medical equipment and devices occur. The company’s proposed solution seeks to enhance SPD technicians’ work performance and skill levels, decrease SPDs’ operating costs, reduce Hospital Associated Infections (HAI) and Surgical Site Infections (SSI), lessen expensive surgical delays, and reduce related healthcare service delivery costs. Sterile processing technicians play a critical role in preventing infection by sterilizing, cleaning, processing, assembling, storing, and distributing medical supplies. They are directly responsible for disinfection and sterilization of hospital instruments/devices. The team uses mixed reality designed to augment the day-to-day work responsibilities of SPD technicians while supporting the cost-effectiveness of operating a SPD. The solution’s digital content and holograms provide an immersive experience increasing competency, maximizing workflow, and boosting productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project incorporates three applications into augmented reality hardware to enhance the job performance of sterile processing department (SPD) technicians. The applications include barcode/radio frequency identification (RFID) reading, traceability and surgical instrument detection, and inspection utilizing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).  These applications are designed to provide efficient and accurate tracking, improved workflow, and increased worker productivity. The research goals of the project include creating a software application programming interface (API) capable of reading barcodes and RFID tags. By providing additional monitoring and tracking capabilities with automated data within the users' field of view and creating an application to enhance object detection capabilities, SPDs in hospitals, doctors' offices and at-home care locations can learn, in real time, the best practices for sterilization of infected surfaces to enable safer and healthier living and work spaces.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to engage citizen in environmental research activities, potentially increasing the selection of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers for youth. This project focuses on enhancing academic and industry partnerships around citizen science, improving science and environmental literacy, and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields of study. In addition to improving the nation’s scientific and technical workforce pipeline, the project seeks to employ a unique commercialization model for interactive educational media that allows for both authentic learning and widespread use by general audiences. This model mixes digital and in-person experiences, digital distribution methods, and mobile experience commercialization strategies that can serve as a model for other educational and commercial interactive media companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two critical issues: engaging more youth in environmental science and engineering education and increasing local environmental data for scientists. The project team will research and develop optimal methods and tools for creating educational and interactive media with rapid scientific data collection capabilities. For youth and educators, the project seeks to engage users in national standards-aligned scientific learning activities. The project will create hyperlocal networks that collect data and make results directly available to local communities so that they can actively track pressing environmental concerns such as migrations and changes in populations of species. The technical goals of the project include creating new processes for connecting local, crowdsourced user input to citizen science data repositories in a way that automates the categorization and validation of that data. The resulting project will actively engage youth in real scientific research and improve data collection for federal and university environmental science programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides virtual interfaces that can be dynamically customized to address the challenge of user adoption in augmented reality (AR) products. This project overcomes previous limitations for AR such as the lack of interoperability, user-acceptance, scalability, and application-aware user intent recognition. While the AR market is projected to grow, wearable collaboration has unexplored potential. Users empowered by this project may be able to easily collaborate alongside skilled experts as well as robotic interfaces in the same medium. Through contextually-aware dynamic controls, manufacturing businesses can lower the risk of human-error while increasing fulfillment capabilities, as employees working from home can stay physically connected and remain engaged with minimal compromise. The AR innovation proposed in this project has application across multiple industries, including manufacturing, training, and emergency simulations.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create a framework for scalable experimentation of virtual interfaces that empower users to search, tag, and store meaningful data using gesture interactions in a secure and private manner. This project seeks to provide context-based, hands-free interaction with wireless devices while minimizing the need to set up sensors (such as optical components or microphones) in controlled environments and providing visual feedback and accessibility to the end user. A wrist-worn wearable captures pre-trained gesture data, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses identifies and analyzes an object within the context of said gestures to control a mechatronic device, such as a robot, to perform occupational tasks. This dynamic process uses factors such as the user’s gaze area, physical location, and computer application.  The improvement upon gesture control may allow a separate visual unit, such as the AR glasses, to wirelessly receive and display the gesture intents and perform contextually-aware, meaningful interactions with a clear distinction across a plurality of devices or digitally tagged objects associated with a specific use-case.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is not limited to the higher education community, but has broader application at the elementary, middle and high school levels, especially in underserved and marginalized communities experiencing increased rates of suicide and mental health issues. This project's innovative technologies can assist in the mental health crisis in the country's youth, and specifically in the Native American health system as well as Juvenile Detainee/Juvenile Justice systems. This project's implementation of research based on the benefits of game-based intervention coupled with biometric sensing has the potential to provide the technologies necessary to equip the mental health profession to develop options that could replace pharmacological interventions with a path to delivering personalized and measurement-based mental health services.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses predictive algorithms, wearable technology and peripheral autonomic biofeedback to provide timely and effective data to enable mental health professionals to enact treatments and therapeutic support for students. Challenges in the increase of adult mental illness, shortage of mental health professionals and shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists require a move towards tele-psychiatry, collaborative care and innovative technology to bridge the gap between inadequate supply and increasing demand.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a technology that delivers low cost of energy from offshore wind and unlocks new markets inaccessible to current technology, e.g., small populations with smaller, locally-maintained turbines, deep water locations where conventional floaters are not economical, and regions lacking deep ports. If successful, the global impact may have the potential to suppress carbon emissions at the scale of gigaton carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent/year. The proposed technology is a floating wind turbine that may reduce 80% of the weight of a conventional floating turbine and makes it possible to fabricate more components locally, with domestic businesses and jobs. The newly proposed architecture will be tested to ensure it survives and operates well in the ocean environment. The crucial first step is to adapt the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) world-class wind-wave software to simulate the unusual motions of the system and demonstrate its viability. The end goal is the commercialization of a disruptive offshore wind turbine, developed in the U.S. and deployed globally, that can outcompete all of today’s designs, in a market estimated to soon reach ~$100 billion/year.

    This project seeks provide the intellectual foundation that leads to a first-of-its-kind class of offshore wind turbines that have minimal weight, that rides on top of the waves, taht expands deployability into regions inaccessible with current technology, and that increases mobility for installation / maintenance. Such a floating structure has never before been designed and this project may provide deep insight into several questions about the loading and motions that arise from a complex superposition of turbulent wind, random waves, ocean current, rotor elasticity and angular momentum, and dynamic blade pitch and generator control. This STTR proposal seeks to address a critical technical risk: adaptation of NREL’s simulator OpenFAST to characterize the unique motions of the system operating in a complex environment of loading from wave, wind and current and the resulting impacts on loading and power production. The proposed system departs from long-standing industry conventions that have relied on the design principle of limiting system motions. The results of the simulator may be used to refine the system design and then demonstrate that it's dynamic behavior complies with the design load cases required for certification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovaiton Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable method to grow healthy produce for individuals residential consumers, independent of location, climate, or season of the year. Rotary aeroponic growing systems have the potential to reduce food waste, potable water consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions by decentralizing the production of highly perishable produce within a consumer's home. Growing fresh produce in the home may not require the use of pesticides or preservatives. Socio-disadvantaged individuals located in food deserts may benefit from an automated indoor gardening appliance by subscribing to low-cost organic seed pods that could be delivered and grown directly in their home, generate long-term returns on investment and lowering instances of obesity through healthier diets. Studying the effects of light interactions in a small rotary aeroponic appliance my encourage a new market for high margin seed pods that could be assembled in mass quantities by disabled individuals. Converting highly perishable goods into non-perishable, subscription seed pods may have the potential to reduce food prices and reduce instances of food insecurity throughout the world.

    Rotary aeroponic cultivation is the method of growing plants on a rotating cylindrical tower that is affixed vertically within a controlled environmental chamber. The key innovation in this project is the coupling of rotary aeroponics with tunable lighting to enhance the growing efficiency of the plants. Phase II research will examine how the wavelengths and timing of the lighting can impact plant photomorphogenesis.  The tower design is expected to provide a larger surface area for growing plants in comparison to traditional vertical farming methods, increasing the number of plants that can be grown in a smaller space with less power consumption. The goal of this project is to successfully grow a healthy polyculture assortment of leafy green vegetables in a food safe environment. The multi-spectral light will be used to learn how to maximize plant yields, minimize food safety risks, and enhance the taste profiles of different plant types to ensure the best user experience.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the affordable and energy-efficient design of advanced powered lift aircraft, creating aircraft capable of transporting people and things to new locations. The reduction in transport cost and emissions made possible by this project may ensure that the advanced air mobility market, expected to grow to $120 Billion by 2030, develops community-compatible, economically- and socially-relevant mobility capabilities. The fundamental aerodynamic technology developed by this project may be applicable to a wide range of aircraft sizes and missions, enabling new capability in defense, public safety, and humanitarian roles as well as improving the quality of life for the public by enabling affordable, advanced mobility and logistics in urban, suburban, and underserved rural areas. The increased efficiency of the technology may enable these benefits to be realized while reducing the environmental impacts.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to confirm the feasibility of a new method of distributed electric propulsion for lift augmentation that combines high lift for low-speed performance with low drag, cruise-efficient wing design using a novel integrated propulsor. The project will explore the  complex and incompletely understood aerodynamic interaction of a propeller and wing, which is key to technical and commercial success. The technical objectives include: characterizing the slipstream influence on the wing pressure distribution and boundary layer characteristics, the influence of variations in propeller and wing configuration and location on high lift performance, and the aircraft level effects and tradeoffs of the configuration. The project seeks to meet these technical objectives with a combination of experimental wind tunnel research and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and analyses to thoroughly understand and characterize the complex flow physics and their impacts on aircraft performance and design. The effort may advance the propeller-wing interaction aerodynamics field.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the all-around strength of three dimentional (3D)-printed polymer objects, which will make such objects more useful for structurally-stressed prototypes and manufactured products (including prototypes and products that are physically large).  The prposed strength gains are expected from embedding continuous carbon-fiber filaments in multiple directions within the body of a 3D-print. Designers and engineers seek to tailor internal carbon-fiber arrangements to suit their specific needs. The resulting carbon-fiber-reinforced objects (as with 3D-printed objects in general) may be produced without the expensive and/or time-consuming use of molds, tooling, or specialized hand-labor.  By facilitating the cost-effective production of strong, plastics-based custom and low-volume manufactured products, this project seeks accelerate product development, foster entrepreneurship, and encourage manufacturing endeavors within the United States by making it easier to turn imagined concepts into strong, functional objects in the physical world.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a process for embedding continuous, layer-crossing, carbon-fiber filaments within the body of a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D print in order to provide tensile and shear reinforcement along planes orthogonal to the 3D printed layer. The goal of the research is to employ quasi-parallel filaments oriented orthogonal to 3D print layers, reducing the interlayer weakness and resultant structural anisotropy characteristic of FDM prints.  The project will further examine the use of more complex filament arrangements to provide selective reinforcement in directions and along paths specified by a product designer.  The overall strength, stiffness, and toughness will be assessed adn compared to conventionally-manufactured engineering plastics.  The embedding process, which will take place simultaneously with the layer-by-layer creation of the print, will be achieved by combining the actions of FDM printer nozzles with those of automated robotic filament manipulators.  The project will examine the geometric range of printed parts and components that incorporate reinforcing filaments, with initial goal of printing reinforced shell-like objects that continuously curve along multiple axes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to potentially provide personalized hearing health care for those with hearing loss. Providing a customized amplification device and app solution that allows the user to understand speech more clearly may avoid audiologist appointments and allow the user to take control of their hearing right from their phone. Hearing loss is often associated with decreased employment and potentially lower income.  An effective amplification device may enable those with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to improve their employment and earnings.  Additionally, this technology may remove the discomfort that certain populations experience within the medical system and provide individualized empowerment in relation to their hearing.

    The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber – designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.

    The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used in a variety of settings, including doctors’ offices, physical therapy offices, and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of $1.7 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is creating a tool for police officers and other service members who are expected to perform their job duties under high stress.  This Phase 1 project seeks to develop a technology that creates stress scores and alerts users when they are in “red zones” for decision making based on physiological monitoring via a wearable sensor unit. The initial target market segment for this technology is the ~$1 billion law enforcement market as there is a high need for tools that can help de-escalate situations and potentially improve the use-of-force decisions. The pain points of acute stress impacting decision-making have been validated in military and professional athletic markets as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wearable technology that uses skin conductivity to measure stress and alert users via vibrational feedback. This Phase 1 project proposes to: (1) run a pilot study on police officers to collect skin conductance data during scenario training, (2) build machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) models with a high predictive accuracy of poor decision making using this data, (3) determine ideal sensor location and build a custom wearable strap attachment, (4) develop the mobile application to build a data visualization interface for officers and trainers, and (5) test the effectiveness of delivering vibrational feedback during decision making of officers using the prototype. The successful conclusion of Phase 1 may lead to a hardware-software prototype that measures the police officers' emotional stress using a skin conductance signal, then alerts the user via vibrational feedback when they are in a heightened level of stress.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, “green”, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the productivity and safety of operations across the entire $1.3 trillion Blue Economy. Maritime operations routinely involve significant risks to human life and property and consequently bear extraordinarily high operating costs. Autonomous ocean vehicles (falling under the Robotics technology area) are being rapidly adopted by science, commercial, and defense organizations due to their potential to dramatically reduce cost and risk. The success of the proposed project will advance the state of the art for commercial autonomous vehicle compliance with international laws regulating interactions between maritime vessels at sea. Giving autonomous ocean vehicles the ability to interact with crewed vessels safely and predictably will accelerate the adoption of these tools and the missions they enable. Several specific market segments stand to benefit immediately from the proposed technology, including the $31B offshore wind market, the $2B port automation market, the $233B aquaculture market, and dozens of others. Beyond market impacts, humanity needs ocean data to understand the critical dangers of overfishing and climate change.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the design of systems and software needed for autonomous ocean vehicles to comply with the international collision regulations (COLREGS) for maritime vehicles. The difficulty the industry has faced in creating COLREGS compliant autonomy is the fact that the rules were developed with the expectation that experienced mariners would be able to make qualitative interpretations in unique situations. That led to a descriptive rather than prescriptive set of rules that is good for human mariners, but difficult to implement in software. The objectives of this Phase I project include the design and simulation of autonomous systems able to operate in compliance with the COLREGS. In addition to simulations, the software may be deployed to small autonomous surface vehicles for preliminary on-water testing. Anticipated results include a system able to maintain COLREGS compliance within a documented envelope of conditions. The effective implementation of safe system design, optimized control, and machine learning techniques can combine to produce the first autonomous ocean vehicles that can be trusted in congested waterway settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to produce a high performance, low power, electronic chemical sensor system that does not require a radioactive ionization source. Achieving a low cost, non-radioactive Internet of Things (IoT) systems for chemical sensing in a more distributed and connected network has potentially far reaching implications in many industries. Creating an IoT network of sensors to safely monitor chemical signatures on a large and distributed scale, in real-time, may provide new analytical-quality chemical sensing capabilities. Sensor applications may range from engineering (monitoring fermentations) and to health care (diagnostics), to environmental monitoring (air quality) and defense and security (hazard detection) or agriculture (waste mitigation). The chemical sampling and sensor platform has the potential to be integrated with cell phones and autonomous systems. The market for personal use devices could be substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to establish an experimental and theoretical framework to optimize Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) for analytical quality chemical identification. There are many types of chemical sensors that have been commercialized but no high-quality systems meet the performance, safety, and cost constraints required to be a successfully linked in an IoT system. The fundamental physics and commercial utility of DMS is well established, so it is a leading candidate for this use. The foundation of the system is a miniaturized DMS. Because the microchip operates on lithium ion polymer batteries, it has the potential for widely dispersed IoT-linked chemical sensing but the reliance on radioactive isotopes for chemical ionization is a critical barrier to adoption that limits commercial applications. This technical barrier may be overcome by combining a non-radioactive, plasma-based method of chemical ionization. The experimental results will be used to validate custom software to simulate performance of this complex system. If the performance of the combined system can be successfully modeled, it can be further miniaturized and optimized. The detection of natural gas odorants and selected food and flavor compounds have been selected as initial proof-of-concept commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new technologies to facilitate ocean data collection. Understanding the oceans is important for climate research, naval operations, maritime domain awareness, and ecosystem preservation, yet traditional data collection methods using research ships, commercial vessels, and buoys are cumbersome, expensive, and  limited in their scope of discovery. While satellites have enabled remote data collection, they are affected by weather and limited in the types of data they collect. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) - robotic boats - are promising, but even today’s smallest oceangoing USVs are too costly for many applications. Thus, many regions of Earth’s oceans are rarely studied. The technology developed here aims to meet this need by enabling low-cost deployment of sensor-equipped robotic fleets. Better access to ocean data may improve understanding of the ocean and its resources, leading to better climate modeling, improved safety, economic gains, and more effective regulations. Further, ocean monitoring and surveillance is key to understanding ocean water quality, identifying contaminants, and devising strategies to prevent future contamination and pollution of the ocean’s waters. Ultimately, cost-effective oceanic data collection may help sustain and grow the ocean economy.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a small, low-cost, autonomous robotic sailboat that uses an innovative sail arrangement and weather-optimized navigation system. With a combination of affordability and utility, the technology represents a new approach for widespread oceanic data collection. This technology can be deployed virtually anywhere in the ocean, can be small (2 meters or less), and is 100% wind- and solar-powered. The research in this project seeks to further this technology by advancing two innovations: passive directional stability and weather-optimized navigation. Unlike most other robotic sailboats, the proposed USV does not need active steering to hold a course, once set. Further, the proposed USV has a navigation system that exploits the spatial and temporal variance in the weather and uses local weather data to direct the boats to navigate more efficiently. This STTR proposal seeks to address areas of high technical risk including stability of the steering system under various wind and water conditions, resistance to traveling excessively downwind during storms, effectiveness of the optimized navigation system in both actual and simulated weather conditions at locations worldwide, construction and performance of prototypes in lakes and oceans, and long-term resistance to marine environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to facilitate improved animal husbandry practices by providing high-performance natural supplements that can replace prophylactic antibiotics, drugs, and hormones. The use of medically-relevant antibiotics in animal feed initiated the spread of “super bugs,” causing a public health concern. Reducing the dependency on antibiotics in animal feed requires a concerted effort from multiple sectors. The outcome from this project may provide pragmatic alternatives to using antibiotics. Through research and demonstration, this project aims to overcome consumer skepticism towards accepting new supplements and contribute to maintaining profitability in animal farming even after antibiotics are eliminated from feed.

    The proposed project uses state-of-the-art computational tools in enzyme design to create new biocatalysts with tailored microorganisms. The resultant designer microorganisms with new functionalities may produce supplements used in animal feed using sustainable bioprocesses. A crucial component of the project is to design efficient bioprocesses that provide supplements that are fungible with existing supply chains, without the need for any additional on-farm infrastructure. Many natural supplements are either extracted from plants or produced using harsh processes, contributing to their expense. Successful completion of this project may overcome geographical or seasonal limitations in supplment production and represent the use of cutting-edge technology in the dietary supplements sector.

The primary application area for this project is the mining sector, where the technology may be able to drive efficiency improvements (up to 10%) in the recovery of copper and other key metals. These efficiencies could potentially result in a value opportunity of close to $1 billion per year in the US alone. The technology can also be applied to monitoring the stability of dams and levees, a widely-recognized ongoing concern, where it can provide safety and environmental benefits to the industry and society at large.

    The intellectual merit of this project is primarily related to both the continued development of field-ready instrumentation and of original data inversion methodologies. This includes: i) validation of the prototype sensor developed in Phase I under control conditions; ii) development and testing of fit-for-purpose conveyance and other hardware required for remote operation; iii) development of an original, three-dimensional data reconstruction algorithm driven by customer needs; and iv) development of commercially ready answer products and user interfaces. These innovations will serve to demonstrate the feasibility, technology readiness, and value of the proposed solution to the mining industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.  Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks to  disrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.

    \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower\
    \ limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology. \
    \ Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation\
    \ is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer\
    \ from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional\
    \ electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to\
    \ the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.\
    \  Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects\
    \ during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode\
    \ is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate\
    \ electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.\
    \  The proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic\
    \ surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible\
    \ by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back\

    \  By positioning a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode,\
    \ the team is expected to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision\
    \ therapy.   To accomplish these goals, the project includes three critical tasks\
    \ including:  (1) develop a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics,\
    \ package, and lead array, (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and\
    \ (3) prepare prototypes for subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal\
    \ of the project is to accelerate the medical-grade hardware development effort\
    \ to enable future therapies to treat low-back pain.  Eventual validation after\
    \ this project is completed will be performed in humans by selectively applying\
    \ stimulation and recording if the patient feels therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to serve the breast cancer community. In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology that will improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in combatting the U.S. illegal drug epidemic, which contributed to over 67,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. An affordable, effective field drug test system, superior to conventional color test kits and Raman-based test systems, would address this challenge, particularly because the widely used color test kits are outdated, hazardous, and susceptible to a high false positive rate. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit data analysis that will help LE reduce the supply of dangerous drugs from the communities they serve. This innovation has the potential to expand into other markets, including medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a novel system for on-site presumptive drug testing and collection of drug intelligence for LE. Conventional color tests are inaccurate and highly flawed, often resulting in failure to accurately detect common drugs and novel drug analogues as they are introduced into the illegal substance market. Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the ability to enable a safer, more reliable, and more resilient electric power system. A reliable and efficient grid is the cornerstone of the nation’s economy. With the rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), a transition from conventional generation plants to utility-scale wind and solar farms, and the threat of cyber- and/or physical attacks on the bulk electric system, ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid has become ever more challenging. The software being developed in this project will help grid planning engineers and operators cope with these modern challenges. For the first time, engineers from organizations across the utility industry will be able to collaboratively plan the grid on a secure, scalable, cloud-based software platform that provides the capabilities needed to fully assess the impact of renewables and DERs. The software’s industry-leading simulation robustness will allow users to analyze extreme contingencies, cascading events, and weak grid scenarios to develop preventive and corrective actions that secure the grid. The software is designed to support an annual $50B+ in US power infrastructure investment and an annual $400B+ in power market transactions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software for electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) planning.  Technical tasks are to: 1) Make cloud architecture responsive to demand with autoscaling and queueing services; 2) Architect results generation for minimized data storage requirements; 3) Manage data handling for reduced re-loading of datasets; 4) Implement a file parser for industry-standard three-phase unbalanced distribution system models; 5) Implement models of common distribution system components; and 6) Extend the cloud platform to support integrated T&D analysis.  Integration of these optimized components will lead to an improved system engineered for usage at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may be a fundamental shift in academic and life outcomes for students, especially those from low-income and vulnerable populations, by building metacognition and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. This project will advance the company's technology that builds critical SEL and metacognition skills in a way that is student-led and integrated with academic content and routines.  The effort expands teacher capacity in a measurable way. The project will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the company’s proprietary data of student reflections and teacher feedback, will train Machine Learning (ML) driven predictive algorithms to measure reflection quality and will build a learning strategies recommendation engine. This innovation will allow teachers and students to expand their toolkits of effective pedagogically-sound learning strategies. The deeper application of the innovation unlocks commercialization potential coupled with transformational outcomes for student learning.


    The Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support the feasibility and commercialization of applying NLP techniques and ML algorithms based on the company’s proprietary data to “read” student reflections, rate them on a quality rubric, and help teachers provide feedback. Stage I of this project will be a lower effort, fast value objective to apply data science and analytics to roll-up real-time quality assessments to measure growth at the student.  The project will provide reports on the reflection quality to school administrators and feedback tips to teachers based on student reflection quality and classroom context. Stage II would be a higher effort.  One objective will be to build a Strategy Recommendation Engine driven by NLP and ML techniques and based on the latest research in pedagogy and learning sciences. This technology will analyze past reflections to identify which learning strategies a student has tried, then provide teachers with suggestions on pedagogy-driven strategies they can be recommended to improve the students' learning.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop the first universal method for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of all main bodily fluids in biological stains revealed at a crime, overcoming the limitations of standard biochemical tests when identifying biological stains. The proposed technology will allow for rapid, accurate and nondestructive identification of, and distinction between, biological stains that supports the possibility of linking DNA to a bodily fluid type, thus increasing the efficiency of crime labs and assisting law enforcement personnel in the identification of suspected criminals. Commercially, this technology will be of use to the 600+ Crime Investigation Labs and 19,000+ crime scene investigators within the U.S. Department of Justice. The new approach has the potential to reduce the backlog of unprocessed DNA samples in crime labs across the U.S., while providing data that can improve the efficiency of evidence analyses.

    This analysis platform has the potential to significantly advance the field of crime scene analysis by replacing single body fluid-specific chemical tests, that are inaccurate and destructive in nature, with software that offers the novel ability to positively identify all bodily fluids in order to generate real-time decisions regarding sample content and further analyses.  The project will establish proof-of-principle through the optimization of a Raman spectroscopy method for a desktop instrument while further developing software for realistic body fluid sampling. This will allow for the development of a working prototype for crime laboratory usage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is to enhance the scientific and technological understanding of designing lift-assist exosuits (mechanized clothing), an assistive technology that has the potential to impact society by reducing the fatigue, back injury risk, and back pain of delivery drivers. For employers, the exosuit creates the potential for reduced employee turnover and medical costs.  The proposed exosuit has potential commercial impact as the first and only lift-assist exosuit for delivery workers, a ubiquitous and growing job sector that cuts across nearly all commercial markets. This project could additionally impact the economic competitiveness of the United States by increasing the available workforce and reducing the cost of healthcare for Americans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address key design challenges associated with assistive technologies that provide lift-assistance for delivery drivers. Surmounting this technical hurdle relies on two key features: (1) the ability to turn assistance on/off when carrying an object, and (2) the ability to sit comfortably for long periods of time while driving. The research objectives of the Phase II project are to: 1) add a new mode-switching capability, 2) integrate a unique method of disengaging assistance that maximizes comfort during sitting, 3) create a novel leg sleeve to maximize comfort when the exosuit is not assisting, and 4) carry out a field study to validate exosuit performance in real-world conditions. This project will combine technical requirements and user stories with a series of rapid design iterations. Using this approach, multiple prototypes will be designed, built, and tested with delivery drivers to assess real-world performance and user acceptance. This project is projected to result in a commercially viable exosuit prototype that fits the daily needs of delivery drivers, as well as objective and subjective evidence of its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project is the creation of a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost, semi-automatic. ultra-high-altitude balloon system for suborbital transportation system. The technology seeks to provide routine sub-orbital atmospheric flights for environmental testing of payloads in the ultra-low vacuum of the Mesosphere (260,000 feet).  The technology also seeks to transport metrological payloads, such as radiosondes (that measures pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) and rawinsondes (that evaluate wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) at all altitudes from the ground to 260,000 feet for extended periods of time. This capability is especially critical for increasing the success rate of space missions. The new testing capability may save the space industry hundreds of million dollars in technology failures annually. The transportation of metrological payloads to the upper extremes of the atmosphere for extended periods of time may also provide improved accuracy of weather forecasts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to solve well-known problems that prevent balloons from taking payloads to the upper atmosphere. This project will develop hardware prototypes, perform software development, and integrate the hardware and software together.  The team will perform flight demonstrations to characterize the impact of the Mesospheric environment on the ballooning flight transport and demonstrate the low-cost payload transport to the Mesospheric sub-orbital altitudes for a long duration (> hour).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate the adoption of error correction technologies in the quantum computing industry.  It is widely held that quantum error correction will be critical to realize the potential of universal quantum computing.  An error-corrected quantum computer holds promise for making transformational discoveries in science and engineering that will have broad impact across traditional technology sectors. By developing resource-efficient quantum error correction design and decoding software tools, this Phase I project aims to hasten the era of error-corrected quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new method for error syndrome extraction from a register of data qubits during the execution of an error-corrected quantum algorithm. In contrast to the standard approach to syndrome extraction, where each quantum codeword is treated independently, this new approach extracts error information from the entire quantum computer collectively.  The algorithmic and cost advantage of the proposed approach is a reduction in the number of extra qubits required for error syndrome extraction. This project will focus on reducing the density of the quantum circuits used for syndrome extraction according to the new approach. Low-density quantum circuits are critical for robust quantum error correction since syndrome extraction is mediated by two-qubit entangling gates, which often have error rates higher than idling or memory errors occurring in the data qubits. Another objective of this Phase I project is to design low-density error correcting codes that promote locality in syndrome extraction. Local syndrome extraction is important for error correction in quantum processors that support limited connectivity between qubits. A final objective is to benchmark the proposed constructions and algorithms on simulated data and perform proof-of-concept experimental validation on cloud-based quantum computers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the high costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) methods. HVAC constitutes approximately 48% of building energy consumption representing a significant cost to society. Much of this energy is generated by fossil fuels, resulting in substantial environmental impacts: carbon emissions associated with residential and commercial use are 35.6% of total US emissions.  Geothermal or ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) represent the most energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly HVAC solution currently available, however, their high upfront capital costs have significantly slowed their deployment. The innovation in the present project takes a fundamentally different approach to GSHP heat transfer, resulting in reductions of 50% in installation costs and 20% in operating costs compared to conventional GSHP systems, enabling an expansion of the geothermal market. The present project seeks to thoroughly field test and analyze the performance of the GSHP innovation, optimizing the fabrication and installation parameters, and readying it for commercial deployment.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address the high installation cost and large, disruptive footprint of conventional GSHP systems. The project objective is to demonstrate a compact, cost-effective, easily-deployable, renewable solution for HVAC. The advection-driven GSHP (AGHP) takes advantage of the 4-5 times greater heat capacity of water than rock. Under the present project, AGHP will advance beyond numerical and laboratory analyses to manufacturing and field testing performance under real-world conditions. The research objectives include: 1) finalization of field site, 2) preliminary design and numerical modeling of the AGHP system for a chosen field site; 3) engineering retrofit design; 4) fabrication of the custom designed submersible pump and heat exchanger; 5) installation and testing of the AGHP system; 6) operation, monitoring, and analysis of the performance of AGHP system, including the development of a comprehensive cost, energy use, and emissions model for the AGHP system; and 7) use of the compiled data to estimate the potential for the economic viability of AGHP in various regions of the United States. The anticipated result of this project is a commercially-ready GSHP product with design and installation guidelines for determining the potential for deploying the innovative AGHP system at any given location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create very low power and very high capacity optical interconnects for general computer applications. Computer performance is limited by the speed, power, and latency of connections between chips and memory. The limitations of electrical interconnects are well known, and optical interconnects overcome the limitations and offer 100-1000 times performance improvements. While historically optical interconnects have been hampered by high cost and high power, recent developments show that the promise of optical interconnects can be practically realized. Optical interconnects will dramatically improve overall performance of enterprise and cloud computing services, especially when used in data center computers, while reducing electrical power consumption. This will in turn permit a vast improvement in resource utilization and dramatic reduction in the cost of computation across all segments of society

    The proposed project will develop an optical peripheral component interconnect expreess (PCIe)-compatible transparent bridge for general computer interconnects. PCIe is the most prevalent interconnect used today in computers. The technology developed in this proposal, based on light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitters, multicore optical fibers, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photodetectors, seeks to  reduce electrical power consumption from ~10 pJ/bit for electrical solutions to ~100-200 fJ/bit. The use of LEDs leverages investments already made for cost and power effective LED lighting and displays. The small size of the LEDs and multicore fibers allows for data densities of >1 Pbps/cm2. Electrical interconnects and other optical interconnect technologies cannot compare with the performance of these LED based optical interconnects. These advantages enable physical disaggregation of the compute, storage, and memory functions, improving system performance and resource utilization. This Phase II effort is focused on the development of a PCIe-compliant transparent bridge for applications in chip to chip and chip to memory interconnects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, which affects about one in eight men and is the second deadliest cancer among men. The current process for diagnosing prostate cancer is imprecise and commonly involves multiple rounds of increasingly invasive, uncomfortable, and expensive diagnostic tests. The medical technology proposed in this project will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging tests (MRIs) performed to confirm diagnosis, and enable improved ongoing monitoring of suspected or recovered prostate cancer patients. The proposed device will help hospitals save valuable time and decrease overall costs of care. The device will be designed to address the specific needs of clinicians to accurately diagnose prostate cancer cases at an earlier point in the diagnostic workflow, at a lower cost to health systems. Additionally, the technology will be developed with a focus on cost effectiveness, to ensure increased prostate cancer diagnostic capabilities are accessible even in low-resource settings, such as rural communities and low- and middle-income countries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a prototype of a new medical device that uses photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and novel acoustic lens technology to aid in detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Existing early testing options, such as digital rectal exams, prostate-specific antigen tests, and transrectal ultrasounds, are often inconclusive. The PAI endoscopic probe device proposed in this project will offer hospitals and clinicians a new method for visualizing potentially cancerous prostate tissues, with higher imaging contrast and resolution than existing diagnostics. It will also offer an alternative to other testing methods with known deficiencies that often result in misdiagnosis or missed cases.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to arm emergency personnel with an objective\
    \ tool for identifying large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes while in route to\
    \ the hospital. This rapid and accurate triage of stroke will enable routing of\
    \ patients to the most appropriate care setting and reduce the time to intervention.\
    \ LVOs require endovascular therapy which only comprehensive stroke centers have\
    \ the capability to conduct. If a patient with an LVO is routed to a hospital\
    \ without endovascular capabilities simply because it was closer, the time to\
    \ intervention is extended drastically. When it comes to improving outcomes, time\
    \ to optimal intervention is the most important factor with the best outcomes\
    \ achieved under three hours and statistically significant improvements for each\
    \ 15-minute window under that threshold. Stroke is the second leading cause of\
    \ death and the primary cause of long-term disability worldwide costing the US\
    \ $65B every year. Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke in the US annually and\
    \ 40% are left with a permanent disability. The project will streamline stroke\
    \ triage in the pre-hospital setting to reduce time to intervention and improve\

    \ have the analyzed results presented in an intuitive dashboard identifying the\
    \ probability of an LVO, enabling EMS workers to route patients to stroke centers\
    \ with EVT capabilities. When a patient arrives at the hospital, the determination\
    \ made within the ambulance will be conveyed to physicians who can then immediately\
    \ start intervention, reducing the time from onset to intervention and improving\
    \ short and long-term patient outcomes. Comprehensive historical datasets of EEG-data\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a biosensing technology that may enable highly sensitive, quantitative, point-of-care diagnostics. Once validated, the proposed biosensor, disposable sensor chips/cartridges, and electronic readout modules can be readily mass-produced using existing medical device manufacturing capacities. The technology may have an impact on the health and welfare of patients. The immediate goal is to examine interleukin protein monitoring for early detection of cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening health complication that develops in patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment, organ transplant, infectious disease, sepsis, etc. Additional applications include early detection of cancers or cancer recurrence, dry eye disease, existing and emerging infectious disease, biothreats, etc.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a proof-of-concept demonstration of a low-cost, magnetic biosensor technology that may enable analytical laboratory capabilities for reliable biomarker detection and quantitation at the point of care. The proposed biosensor will be adapted for quantitative detection of interleukin proteins in blood for early diagnostics of cytokine release syndrome. The technology integrates magnetic sensing into the ubiquitous lateral flow assay (LFA) format (used in pregnancy tests) utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as reporters of biomolecular interactions. The tests are well-suited for point-of-care applications where rapid and convenient access to low-cost diagnostic tools helps improve patient care. The rationale for this project is that the proposed biosensors can provide clinically-relevant quantitative data rivaling those of state-of-the-art laboratories while preserving the advantages of LFA tests in terms of low cost and ease of use. The disposable chip with its clam-shell design builds upon the usual LFA cassette design. The disposable chip will be produced and assembled from low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and is expected to add only cents to the cost of an LFA test. A low-cost portable reader capable of ultrahigh sensitivity quantitative readings will be built from conventional off-the-shelve electronic components.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project on a handheld simultaneous translator advances the state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning acceleration. Beyond technical contributions, the novel translator will likely have a significant impact on a wide range of domains, such as military personnel deployed in foreign countries, businesspeople participating in multilingual meetings, medical service providers, law enforcement, customer support services, diplomats and political representatives, local governmental entities providing services to citizens in the preferred language, and international tourists. As such, the project will have broader impacts in increasing economic competitiveness, advancing health and welfare, and improving military capabilities of the United State. Furthermore, the project helps to enhance equity in education and STEM literacy by enabling better access to educational resources to people of diverse backgrounds, especially immigrants, women, and underrepresented minorities in some countries/regions, who were previously disadvantaged due to limited prior educational access or limited access to foreign language courses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the research and development of innovative algorithmic optimizations and a purpose-built translation device to enable fast, accurate and low-power inference for simultaneous translation. The overall approach is to exploit the unspoken but implied connections among language elements at various levels to guide the learning model. Specific techniques are investigated at the phoneme-level, work-level, and sentence-level. Collectively, these innovations aim to reduce the computation complexity of simultaneous translation by orders of magnitude while increasing translation accuracy. A systematic and comprehensive methodology is also being established that allows fast implementation of the inference hardware via high-level synthesis and reports detailed statistics on translation accuracy, latency, power, and area to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the research.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide a significant improvement in economic incentives for water rights holders to conserve and efficiently deploy their water. One of the greatest struggles facing the Western States is the disincentive for water rights holders to efficiently manage their water. If holders don’t use the entirety of their water each year, they risk losing the unused portion back to the State. Commercially, despite a billion-dollar demand for seasonal leasing of water—which would satisfy annual use requirements—water holders have no place and little ability to market and lease their unused water. This approach using the proposed distributed ledger technology (DLT), allows holders to track and log their water rights information on its platform. In turn, water users will finally have access to information that traditionally informs other property transactions—title history, water usage, comparable transactions, and localized pricing. With that information, our customers populate a marketplace where short-term and long-term transactions can be quickly and easily transacted. In sum, by creating the tools and interfaces to digitize water rights and enable simple-to-execute water transactions, DLT will power water markets and drive efficient water use throughout the West.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and develop a unique combination of distributed ledger (DL) tokenization and a decentralized distributed file system (DDFS) to produce a robust digital twin of both physical water rights and usage, as well as the associated legal materials and data. DL tokens represent the legal quantity of water that has been granted to the user by the government. DDFS allows the storage of key information pertaining to the water rights—including title and use history—in a public, immutable manner, anchored in the DL transactions. This approach provides a level of trust, transparency and provenance for water that is currently absent in the United States. The current state of the market—makes it impossible for the average water owner and manager to have any insight into the value of their water assets. Water-specific marketplaces backed by DL and DDFS allow both buyers and sellers the ability to view, vet, and transact water assets efficiently and with minimal cost. This first phase of research and development will establish the requisite infrastructure to populate those marketplaces.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to promote increased recycling and to enable the upcycling of two of the most common polymers found in mixed waste streams: polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). While plastic recycling can assist in mitigating the vast and continuously growing volume of plastic waste, mixed plastic streams—notably those with PE and iPP—introduce many challenges.  These polymers are immiscible but of similar density, making them unsuitable for simple melt-blending yet difficult to separate. Although additives have been developed to overcome the immiscibility issue, these additives typically need to be added at high loadings and produce resins with poor mechanical properties. This project focuses on the development of advanced additives (compatibilizers) that can be introduced in low concentrations to produce PE/iPP resins with superior durability, ductility, and industrial utility that rivals or outperforms homopolymers. Such a technology has the potential to bring superior efficiency to the mixed recycling process, advancing the field toward a more circular plastics economy. By delivering high-value products from waste streams, widespread adoption of this technology would drive improvements in plastic waste collection, recycling, and re-manufacturing, supporting jobs in these and adjacent fields.

    This project involves the creation of non-reactive, multi-graft copolymers capable of supporting high-quality iPP/PE blends with superior tensile strength characteristics, impact resistance, and rigidity compared to current resins. The proposed approach leverages interlocked molecular entanglements and co-crystallization to provide stronger adhesion to iPP and PE. This technology seeks capability of up to 30% iPP contamination in PE using as little as 1 wt% additive to generate high-value blended materials. Phase I development will involve: 1) optimization of polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymer compatibilization additives, 2) scale-up of optimized polyethylene-graft-iPP copolymers, 3) testing of larger scale batches for end polymer qualities, and 4) testing of compatibilizers with combinations of different grades of actual post-consumer plastic waste. The technology may contribute to an enhanced understanding of how specific copolymer architectures influence compatibilization efficiency, while also meeting the need for technologies to support compatibilization of PE and iPP for blended recycling applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is based on the improvement of respiratory equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE). Commercially available face masks, gowns, filter media and other PPE are contaminated through environmental exposure, posing a threat to healthcare personnel.  The proposed solution is a high-surface-area antiviral/antimicrobial micropowder which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Improved protection from infections and reduced cross-contamination may result in fewer deaths, decreased healthcare costs, and increased economic productivity. The addressable global PPE market was $23 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow through 2028, while the global disposable face mask market was valued at $792 million in 2019, and the inclusion of other types of PPE increases this estimate further. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving the demand for these products, though the applicability of the proposed technology is not limited to COVID-19. The proposed product will be material that can modify the surfaces of fabrics with active antiviral properties, leading to improvements in health and safety. The customer base is expected to be healthcare personnel, pharmaceutical and food manufacturing facilities, the public, and manufacturers of PPE, medical devices, textiles, and filters.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to improve the antiviral/antimicrobial properties of respiratory equipment and PPE, which is typically only passively protective, is difficult to decontaminate and re-use, and can lead to worker exposure during changing and handling. The proposed solution is a high-surface-area micropowder, coated with an antiviral/antimicrobial coating, which can be applied to PPE surfaces. Unlike current technologies, the particle size, morphology, surface area, and topography can all be tailored for specific biocidal activity. Additionally, powder shape and surface quality can be customized to enhance adhesion. The proposed project is to develop a prototype powder product formulation that allows easy application of antiviral (copper alloy) coated particles to fabrics and other materials. This technology is based on a fluidized-bed, plasma-enhanced deposition process for synthesizing unique core-shell micropowders of metal, ceramic, or highly-shaped nanoforms of carbon, including proven biocidal materials. The synthesized microparticles will have high surface-to-weight ratios making them better suited for capturing micro-organisms while also having improved bonding to surfaces of filter media and PPE materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the foundation of a fractional-calculus-based computational platform for the simulation of multiscale and multiphysics systems. This Phase I effort will focus on developing modeling capabilities for nonlinear thermomechanical fatigue and damage behavior of ductile materials and will provide important insights on both feasibility and performance of the fractional calculus approach for a class of nonlinear problems that is not only of extreme importance for scientific and industrial applications but it is also a prototypical example of multiscale and multiphysics systems.
    By leveraging an advanced and generalized class of operators, namely the distributed and variable-order fractional operators, this project will develop fatigue and damage mechanics simulation software capable of continuum scale computational efficiency and microscale accuracy. The resulting formulation will offer an unprecedented combination of computational efficiency, a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, and a revolutionary adaptive mathematical structure that evolves in real-time based on the underlying physics controlling the deterioration and damage process.

    The overarching innovation at the basis of the M3SIM software products is a one-of-its-kind computational platform based on cutting-edge distributed-variable order (DVO) fractional calculus (FC). The unique nature of DVO operators allows the new platform to perform multiscale and multiphysics analyses of complex systems at a level of accuracy and efficiency that is unattainable with traditional methods. This new approach will have profound practical implications for predictive science because it will enable a novel concept of an adaptive computational platform whose structure evolves with the underlying physics without a priori and ad hoc decisions from the user.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the company’s novel fire detection principle and the use of soft computing techniques by means of (1) computational experiments, and (2) a wide range of real fire and nuisance experiments on the company’s fire detector prototypes. This will allow the company to resolve any technical hurdles that may arise from the integration of the software and hardware into a minimum viable fire detector expected to significantly outperform current market solutions. The company has utilized real-world datasets of fire and nuisance experiments conducted by NIST to test and benchmark the innovation. Using temperature data, for example, the company’s algorithm detected fires up to 10 times faster than current technology (fixed-threshold). In addition, no missed detection occurred, and no false alarms were triggered in all NIST experiments. While these results are impressive, they are not sufficient to commercialize the innovation given that they are based on 69 experiments only. The activities proposed in phase I are designed to reduce the technical risk and strengthen the confidence in the company’s technology prior to commercialization. This is especially important because of the high regulatory burden and associated liabilities in the fire detection space.

    By leveraging ML, erli.ai’s patent-pending technology will process streaming data from heat/smoke sensors to detect the earliest signs of fire and separate fire and nuisance events. We introduce a new alarm triggering principle rooted in the temporal analysis of sensor data instead of the existing fixed-threshold approach. We propose to further develop our computational architecture, which employs deep Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and a variational autoencoder, by developing a theoretical basis for the outstanding performance our algorithm produced. We will develop an anomaly detection evaluation scheme for time streaming clustering using Dynamic Time Warping and Similarity Matrix technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major fundamental knowledge gaps underpinning the ability to create accurate flood maps. This proposal will advance new knowledge on the use of advanced analytics for the estimation of floods, thus transforming the tools available to respond and plan for flooding. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that building-scale flood detection will be achieved through a combination of existing sensors and advanced analytics. This SBIR project will research and develop data-driven flood maps to support targeted flood response and long-term infrastructure planning. Using advanced analytics, existing sensor data will be spatially distributed to create real-time flood maps. The method will be validated using a highly dense sensor network in the Great Lakes region. The technical results of this project will yield unprecedented insights and measurements of uncertainty related to flood estimation at urban scales. The resulting real-time flood maps will allow stormwater managers to stay ahead of resident complaints, while saving lives and property by sending their crews to the most important locations. Improved flood maps will also allow stormwater managers to maximize the impact of long-term infrastructure investments.

    The project's goal is to make all communities resilient to floods and climate change. To that end, this proposal will show how advanced analytics, driven by wireless sensing, will transform the ability of first responders to save lives, while helping stormwater managers maximize long-term infrastructure investments. The key innovation of this proposal is a data methodology, which will convert raw, spatially distributed sensor data into actionable, real-time flood maps. This data-driven technique will enable the first of its kind tool to detect floods at the scale of individual buildings, without requiring a sensor at every location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) “always-on” toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power “always-on” IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be transformational to multiple markets that require energy storage. High-energy densities will be enabled by the proposed advanced polymer separators. Potential customers for the new battery separator include battery manufacturers for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, space and military, small wearable devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), drones, consumer electronics, as well as automotive manufacturers in the mass mobility market. Adoption will be driven by the huge demand for electric vehicle batteries that are cheaper, lighter, safer and allow for longer drive ranges and reduced charge time. There are multiple ways in which consumers and society will benefit from the batteries enabled by this novel solid-state separator; from electric cars, to flying taxis; from more efficient energy storage grids to more reliable space vehicles; from lighter wearable devices to long lasting medical implants. In the long-term, the successful development of low-cost, fast-charging, high-density, long-life, and safe batteries enabled by the company’s new separator will reduce fossil fuel dependency and drive the electrification of the transportation sector and the transition towards greener energy solutions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an advanced polymer separator for novel hybrid solid/liquid battery cells which will dramatically improve performance of state-of-the-art solid-state batteries, enabling higher energy density, faster charging rate and enhanced safety over commercial Lithium-ion batteries. The new separator will be constructed from a novel polymer material whose feasibility has been validated at laboratory level. Stability tests showed higher conductivity and stability than currently available options. Compatibility with high-voltage cathodes was also demonstrated in preliminary studies. The goals of the project are (1) to develop a solid electrolyte which has an ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes that are currently used in the Li-ion batteries and (2) a scalable solid separator (using the above electrolyte) that is compatible with high-voltage cathodes (4 – 6 V). Main technical hurdles to overcome for successful commercialization are developing blade-cast-worthy slurries and scaling up the separator to a cell-size free-standing sheet. The former will be achieved by tuning the composition of the slurry to improve solubility; the latter will be achieved by improving the molecular weight of the polymer and blending and mixing it with ceramic oxide.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to make the gathering of tree measurements and other field-based nature observations dramatically easier. The project involves building a mobile app that uses computer vision and augmented reality to make measuring trees much easier than using the tape measures of today, in fact it will be as simple as scanning a barcode. This will result in much more nature imagery and other training data for use with ecological models, which will yield a better understanding of how ecosystems will change in the coming years. One important prediction this project will help with is forest growth which is very useful for generating carbon offsets that can finance the regeneration of large amounts of land. Better ecological models can also help communities prepare for changes in climate, sea level, soil quality and other ecological shifts in the coming decades. Millions of people will be potentially affected by climate change and its accompanying shifts in ecosystems, so arming communities and governments with better insights about these impacts will be critical. Furthermore, catalyzing many millions of hectares of nature regeneration projects will help mitigate the worst effects of climate change and other ecological challenges.


    This project involves the unique combination of computer vision with augmented reality in order to quickly and accurately measure trees. There are multiple computer vision neural networks being developed for the app. One of them uses bark and tree imagery in order to classify the tree species, an important feature needed for ecological models. Another model analyzes surrounding scenery and quickly identifies the closest tree trunk. The app then uses the phone’s augmented reality capabilities to gauge the distance and orientation of the phone from the trunk and combines these two to yield a diameter at breast height measurement. The research plan involves collecting data from specific regions in Panama and Brazil in conjunction with active nature restoration projects and gathering a critical mass of leaf and bark imagery so that species in those areas can be classified accurately. The scope will then increase to additional regions and later, measurements such as birdsong and other biodiversity markers. Over time the app could become a platform for many such nature observations, and it is expected to evolve to become more game-like to attract large numbers of people having fun experiences together and advancing the cause of nature science.

    \ the persistent barriers to safe drinking water access plaguing the more than\
    \ 81 million Americans living in counties with elevated water quality issues.\
    \ As the frequency of climate-related natural disasters and the prevalence of\

    \ water treatment approaches, which rely on energy inputs and infrastructure investment,\
    \ the proposed technology is both sustainable and reliable, and has the flexibility,\
    \ modularity, and scalability needed for facile deployment. Potential commercial\
    \ impact of this disruptive technology is high, considering the number of communities\
    \ currently seeking water treatment solutions that would be easily met with the\
    \ technology, and the subsequent jobs created related to installation and maintenance.\n\
    \n \nThe technical innovation of this project comes from the development of a\

    \ water due to minor temperature swings and can achieve the critical temperature\
    \ for water release within a matter of minutes. This system holds promise for\

    \ of the membranes. The objectives include: 1) investigating the properties and\
    \ performance of SAG membranes with an open-cell membrane structure that dramatically\
    \ improves the water purification rate; 2) performing detailed investigation on\
    \ the SAG rejection rate to harmful mixed impurities and meeting National Sanitation\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a novel method of drying agricultural products that is more energy efficient than current commercial devices and preserves the nutritional value of the dried products. This project is based upon  fast dehydration of wet biomass using desiccants comprised of particles of a certain size and arrangement. According to preliminary trials, this method may be 10 times more energy efficient than other drying methods. This project will produce a reusable particle filter that can be used to efficiently dehydrate food and agricultural products. This drying method can preserve nutritional value within the US food system while simultaneously reducing production costs, make agricultural industries more economically viable, and be easily powered by renewable energy sources thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption within the food industry.

    The technical innovation of this STTR Phase I project is the development of efficient and effective drying methods for agricultural products.  The technology is based on the incorporation of zeolite particles onto a substrate while maintaining their porosity. In order to achieve rapid dehydration of wet matter, the zeolite must be small in size and supported on a substrate so that its surface retains functionality. This methodology requires careful chemical synthesis. The key research goals are to conjugate or physically bind zeolite particles to a porous substrate, maintain the accessible surface area of the zeolite, and create a new material that can endure many cycles of brief low-power microwave heating to accomplish dehydration. In this project, several approaches will be investigated, starting with the synthesis of porous substrates, then modifying the surface to contain a controlled number of chemical functional groups, and then coating the substrate with zeolite using covalent linkages. In addition to covalent monolayer linkages, the project will also aim to optimize substrate coverage using other binding mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will provide the medical field with a broad response detector capable of pairing with cheaper disease diagnostic tools for improved healthcare.  Currently, there is not a commercially available broadband detector that can capture visible light and near infrared light.  The Phase I SBIR effort will lead to an advanced detector capable of spanning this light range and fulfilling this unmet need.  As a commercial product, this detector can be used in multiple commercial sectors including unmanned vehicles, the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.  For example, in the medical field the ideal light for tissue penetration is between visible and near infrared.  The detector developed in this project would permit optical scans of human bodies for disease diagnosis.  The optical scan will provide a cheaper and safer alternative in comparison to expensive MRI technology and high-energy sources, such as x-rays, that result in radiological exposure.  The size of the global medical imaging market is currently valued at $16 billion and the proposed work would help healthcare services in rural areas have access to optical diagnosing services.

    Semiconductor-based detectors are limited to absorbing photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the electronic band gap of the semiconductor.  As a result, there is not a commercially available detector that can span 400-2200nm with fast detection.  The expected outcome of this project is a single broadband detector, based off of the quantum spin Seebeck effect to generate a spin current, that can span 400-2200nm with a flat quantum efficiency and a high response time.  The quantum efficiency (QE) of the patent-protected detector is almost three orders of magnitude lower than semiconductor-based detectors and the largest portion of the project is devoted to improving the QE to commercial levels.  The project will accomplish the following goals: 1) prove the feasibility of increasing the quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, 2) make a readout circuit board, 3) show detector capabilities through building a benchtop-working prototype, and 4) design a compact prototype to be built during Phase II. As a commercial product, this detector can be used in unmanned vehicles, in the medical field, and for the defense and security of the nation.

    The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF’s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.

    This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will help address the major concerns of climate change and sustainability of arable lands. The two common methods of weed control in the agricultural industry, herbicides and soil tillage, have a negative impact on the environment and soil sustainability. The health of the microbial environment in the soil is degraded by the use of herbicides and soil tillage. In addition, soil tillage exposes the organic matter in the soil to oxidation releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goal for reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate is to sequester the carbon in the soil and not release it. At this time, the only option for weed control of mid to late stage weeds without the use of herbicides or soil tillage is manual labor, which is more expensive. The successful development and testing of the precision weeder extraction tool will give the agricultural industry an automated and cost effective option for addressing weed control while helping to reduce the carbon emission from the soil and protect soil sustainability.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector extraction tool that can remove weeds without using chemicals or soil tillage. Advances in machine vision have made it possible to identify the individual plants in a field and determine which plant is the crop and which one is the weed. Presently, the two predominant methods used by automated weeders to kill the weeds is either by a targeted herbicide spray or soil tillage. Both of these methods negatively impact the environment and soil health. The proposed precision weeder will extract and dispose of the weeds without damage to the soil or environment. The economics of weeding will require the device to be simple, cost effective, reliable, and field hardened. Design and development of the extraction tool will use a new and novel method for removing the weeds with advances in design and actuation. The extraction tool will be tested in the field to determine its feasibility. Successful field trials will convince the customer and investor that this is a viable option for commercial automated weeding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is its innovative and potentially transformative contribution to assistive technologies for infants with motor impairment. In the United States, over 40,000 infants per year are born with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down syndrome, that often result in motor impairment. There is currently no device that provides independent movement to infants with motor limitations. Since children learn a great deal about their physical and social environments when they begin to crawl/walk, conditions that deny or delay independent movement can impact cognitive, language, and social development. A device that will let these infants move and explore at the same age as other children could mitigate these developmental delays and facilitate full integration into society.  Lifetime cost of healthcare for these children has been estimated at $250,000. Providing early independent movement could result in a potential $50,000 lifetime reduction in additional interventions such, as behavioral and occupational therapy, special education, and the need for healthcare and educational aides.  This amounts to over $200,000,000 in savings per year to the health and education systems.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need, expressed by parents and therapists, for a device that will allow infants with motor impairment to move independently at the same age as their typically developing peers. Currently, no such device is available.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is the development of a novel control method for a powered device that can be used by infants as young as 6 months old:  The device moves in the direction that the infant leans (as when reaching toward a toy or parent) while preventing collisions and falls.  Previous research has shown that infants as young as five months old can learn to use this control method to purposefully steer a powered device in all directions. The research objectives of this project are to build and validate a second-generation prototype that can be used by parents and clinicians outside of a research setting. Successful completion of these objectives will advance the device from a research testbed to a viable, if limited, prototype, enabling future work to evaluate the impact of the device on the development of cognitive, social, and communication skills for infants with disabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the burden of accessing information for the 1.5 million blind people in the United States by making a full page of refreshable braille text and tactile graphics available in a device resembling a tablet computer. This assistive technology will provide increased access to braille in digital form and enable blind students to read, with their fingers, digitized spatial content including mathematical equations, graphs, and figures, creating parity with their sighted counterparts interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In particular, the product with supporting software will remove barriers to collaboration in classroom learning environments and document preparation in the workplace. The proposed product will improve braille literacy, increase opportunities to enter careers in STEM, and ultimately lead to the employment success and independence of blind Americans.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues efforts to adopt microfluidic technology in order to create a highly manufacturable full-page braille and tactile graphics display that uses pneumatic signals to actuate pins at braille spacing. The anticipated technical innovations shift certain drive functions from electromechanical hardware to the more cost effective and easily manufactured multilayered microfluidic substrate. Since the ultimate objective for this phase of research is to create an integrated system for delivering interactive braille and tactile graphics, the team will focus on designing the interactive experience by which blind users access, on demand, the textual and non-textual information that they desire. The anticipated outcome of this project is a seamless array of actuated pins in a tablet­ sized device capable of presenting a half­ page of braille characters and tactile graphic images.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind’s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot’s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot’s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to enhance scientific and technological understanding in selective harvesting of high-value crops such as strawberry. The innovation proposed here will be a key component in creating a compact economically viable autonomous strawberry harvesting robot. The technology developed in this project will help address the farming labor shortage which is experienced by farmers more and more each year. Agricultural robotics market is estimated to be $11.9 billion by 2026. Providing autonomous harvesting robots will enable farmers to grow more crops with less business risks related to manual labor shortages and will ensure that US farmers remain competitive, while creating more skilled, highly paid jobs.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop critical technologies for delicate selective harvesting of fragile crops such as strawberries at a competitive pace. Recent advancements in computer vision object detection and three-dimensional scene reconstruction will be used to create near real-time operational scenes. Those scenes will be used to detect ripe berries, create a movement path and navigate the fast and precise robot arm for harvesting the berries without damaging fruits while avoiding obstacles.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to introduce a cost-effective way of crop protection from fungal spoilage. Every year, 25% of the food produced by the world is wasted due to fungal infections and contamination of crops with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The combined social, environmental, and economic global annual cost of this food wastage is >$2T. The proposed innovation is centered on harnessing an untapped bacterium to bring a new line of affordable antifungals to a broad base of crop growers across the United States, which are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing preharvest postharvest treatment protocols. The products are quick and easy to manufacture without costly purification procedures. They should be safe for the environment and human health and have a defined mechanism of action. As a result, billions of dollars’ worth of crops, energy, and resources could be saved, leading to increased agricultural sustainability and economic competitiveness of the United States. It may also advance the health and welfare of the American public by enhancing food safety. Finally, it can pave the way for other innovations to combat fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation by developing the first product, safeguarding corn crops from fungal spoilage during both preharvest and postharvest. Corn is the most planted crop in the United States. Every year, the corn industry loses >$1B due to infection with a fungus (Aspergillus flavus), resulting in contamination of the crop with a carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. The critical technical objectives during the project period will be to (1) identify the functional components of the product and demonstrate their mode of action; (2) assess the amounts of those components that can be produced per unit mass of bacterial biomass, (3) determine an optimal formulation of the minimal viable product that can be most effective in preventing fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination in the corn crop, and (4) conduct an optimal toxicity profiling of the minimal viable product. Upon completion, the knowledge obtained will provide valuable insights for effective intellectual protection and regulatory strategy for the products from the technology and identify any potential challenges related to scalability, consistency, and product shelf-life, which will determine the costs and logistics for large-scale manufacturing of the products.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept of using an innovative open aquatic algae cultivation system (OAACS) to overcome scale and cost constraints of current large-scale algal biomass production systems like raceway ponds. Drop-in biofuels derived from OAACS’ biomass have a projected minimum fuel selling price of $2.53/gasoline gallon equivalent, which is competitive with fossil fuels, and have potential production scales that exceed current global fossil fuel usage. Successful commercialization of OAACS can lead to new sustainable energy sources, significant displacement of fossil fuel use, and concomitant reductions in the future environmental and societal impacts of global climate change. If successful, OAACS can also pave the way for sustainable, competitive, and meaningfully large-scale production of other bioproducts like fertilizers and high protein feeds.

    The proposed project aims to fabricate robust liners for OAACS using an innovative forced assembly co-extrusion and two-dimensional multiplication technique and then demonstrate their performance in OAACS scale-down laboratory photobioreactors. The minimum success criterion is production of liners that support sustained algal aerial yields >15 g ash free dry weight/m2/day for weeks or months without the need for liner cleaning or CO2 supplementation. This will establish feasibility that OAACS can meet production scale- and cost-targets. Tasks include: 1. Fabrication and physical characterization of base case liners using previously demonstrated techniques and then extending results to liners with pore size gradients and surface modified nanofibers; 2. Demonstrating high dissolved inorganic carbon transfer rates through the liners; and 3. Demonstrating robust performance of the liners during continuous culturing in laboratory photobioreactors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable discovery of needed T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapeutics for late-stage cancer patients who have limited treatment options. These immunotherapies work by leveraging T-cells engineered with TCRs that will identify and destroy cancer cells that naturally present a marker (antigen) specific to the cancer on their surface (e.g., cancer mutations). This project will develop a high-throughput platform capable of screening many thousands of TCRs against many thousands of antigens to identify clinically relevant TCRs. This project could impact society’s health by discovering TCRs that will serve as the basis for treatments against currently incurable cancers. The commercial impacts are potentially large. The total market size of T-cell therapeutics was $2.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $8.5 billion by 2027. The platform described by this proposal has the potential to discover many TCR based therapeutics, creating value for patient and society at large.

    The proposed project is to develop a platform for identifying clinically valuable TCRs. This platform could be critical for developing new immunotherapies against solid tumors and for understanding the biology that underlies TCR-antigen interaction. Screening thousands of TCRs for functional activation against thousands of antigens is challenging due to the difficulty of tracking interactions between hundreds of thousands of unique cells. The proposed platform and method links T-cell activation with phagocytosis using engineered T-macrophage and antigen presenting cell (APC) lines. T-macrophages engulf APCs as directed by TCR activation, capturing evidence of an interaction within the T-macrophage. The resulting interactions can be read from the T-macrophages via single-cell sequencing. The objective of this project is to produce large cell-based libraries for TCR and antigens and to identify interacting TCR-antigen pairs. The antigen library will include hundreds of clinically relevant cancer targets, such as KRAS and TP53. These results will demonstrate the feasibility of our platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will result in powerful technology for detecting illicit cryptocurrency accounts and funds in close to real time. The commercial and market impact of the technology will be substantial with its ability to trace illicit accounts and funds to a depth and breadth never before possible and to accomplish this in seconds to minutes, as compared to the long to indefinite time it would take conventional network tracing technology.  For society at large, the ability to uncover the most complex money laundering and fraud schemes will help cut the flow of funds to the worst actors using cryptocurrency: organized crime, narcotics dealers, child pornographers, human traffickers, terrorists, and rogue nations. With the platform created in this project, governments in conjunction with the private sector will have tools that can effectively address the sophistication of the criminal schemes.  This will in turn result in greater growth of the cryptocurrency-based economy as businesses and individuals gain greater confidence that they are dealing with legitimate entities that are not seeking to defraud them.

    This SBIR Phase I project will bring to light the most sophisticated illicit schemes involving cryptocurrencies. In doing so, it will secure cryptocurrency systems and advance the fields of network analysis and visualization, which will be needed to understand the schemes. There are three major technical hurdles in the Phase I project. First, the proposed implementation and infrastructure for the network tracing algorithms need to be scaled up to trace the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains in real-time. Second, to be able to trace addresses to known illicit accounts, a sufficient number of these accounts need to be identified. The proposed project will develop software for cross referencing account addresses with both on-chain and clear and dark web activity to build the lists of known bad actor addresses.  Third, for customers to believe the results of the analysis, a network visualization tool to show the chains of custody linking a suspect account to a known illicit account must be created. Because the algorithms can detect the schemes involving thousands of fund transfers between accounts, visualizing the links in a clear manner presents unique challenges. The project will therefore also build the foundation for its novel visualization tool in Phase I.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable very highly-efficient low-cost green hydrogen production by improving a key functional component of a promising water electrolysis technology. Green hydrogen is a chemical fuel and a feedstock with no associated CO2 emissions. In an effort to decarbonize our economy, green hydrogen can address sectors of our economy that are not easily electrified using clean electricity, for example steelmaking, chemicals, heating, and heavy transport such as shipping and aviation. However, the cost of green hydrogen is still too high to prompt large-scale adoption. The pure-water electrolyzers developed in this project can significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs compared to the current state-of-the-art: they require only water and electricity as inputs, and are entirely made of low-cost, non-toxic materials, utilizing domestic supply chains. They are modular, enabling the development of both large hydrogen production facilities and small decentralized systems, e.g., for on-site operations or refueling stations. This project will not only help the adoption of green hydrogen, it will also elucidate how the chemical and electrochemical modifications of active surfaces can more broadly be used to make electrochemical reactions, such as water splitting, more efficient.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to drastically improve a key component of an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMEL): the anode electrode. The anode is the site of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a required but inefficient step during electrolytic hydrogen production. Enhancement of the OER kinetics by improved anode design, if translated to commercial AEMEL systems, would directly lead to a lower cost of green hydrogen. This project aims to replace the conventional two-layer anode, in which a complex catalyst layer is coated on top of a porous transport layer (PTL), with a simpler “unified” anode, in which the PTL is functionalized such that the catalyst layer is no longer necessary and the reaction kinetics are improved. In this project, two approaches to functionalize the PTL surface will be combined: the increase of the electrochemically active surface area (via etching, dealloying, and deposition techniques) and the increase of the intrinsic catalytic OER activity (via alloying and deposition techniques). This effort is expected to result in significantly improved AEMEL performance and lifetime, which will be evaluated using electrochemical methods, both ex situ (3-electrode cell) and in situ (in an operating electrolyzer).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a semiconductor laser technology based on laterally confined photonic crystal cavities. The proposed laser technology may ensure secure semiconductor and microelectronic supply chains within US for energy-efficient high-capacity data center link capabilities, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous driving/aerial vehicles, high performance communication and sensing systems, etc. The novel solution may accelerate technology development, address technical and market gaps, and foster entrepreneurship with important social impacts. The project will help prepare a diversified workforce skilled in semiconductor production, nanotechnology, photonics and optics, and advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize high speed photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSELs) with single-mode, high power output. PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this project centers on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals suffering from motor dysfunction due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and other conditions. In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks. Additional results include increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and turn-over.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of exoskeleton robots targeted at rehabilitation. A substantial portion of the US population requires intensive rehabilitation services for neuromuscular impairment. Robotic rehabilitation has attracted attention due to the potential for better patient outcomes. Current robotic solutions lack the anatomical mobility and compliant dynamic behavior to produce neurologically-sound therapeutic behaviors. The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior. In this project, the physical structures and control algorithms of the exoskeletons will be designed and built with a focus on dynamic transparency and kinematic compatibility with the human body to capitalize on the capabilities of the actuator. Additionally, the control software will use feedback loops and a visually interactive environment with performance metrics to keep patients engaged.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a safe, effective, and sustainably-produced natural sunscreen compound, gadusol, to replace harmful ingredients widely used in current sunscreen products. Two to three million cases of skin cancer are reported globally each year, including 132,000 cases of melanoma. In 2015, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reported 80,442 new cases of melanomas of the skin in the U.S. The potential exists to reverse this trend with effective, safe, aesthetically-pleasing sun protection products that provided long-lasting full-spectrum UV protection. Sustainable production of gadusol and the assurance of its safety and efficacy will enable such products to be developed. With a global sunscreen product market of $16.5 billion and growing, along with the demonstrated need for natural, safer sunscreen actives, this project is poised to have a worldwide, long-term impact on national and global health.

    This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of sustainably producing gadusol, a natural, marine-based compound with proven sun protection capability.  Recent research has documented that widely used sunscreen ingredients pose hazards to the environment and possibly to human health, leading to bans on popular sunscreen products. Mineral active compounds such as ZnO and TiO2 are safer substitutes but pose aesthetic disadvantages, leading to products that many consumers dislike. Gadusol has the potential to replace some of these widely-used chemical actives as a safe, effective, and natural UVB blocker. The technical scope proposed includes overcoming obstacles to sustainable production of gadusol using the tools of synthetic biology, establishing gadusol's safety through standard pre-clinical tests, and assessing its efficacy and suitability in prototype formulations (SPF value). Successful completion of this project will reduce the risks of adopting gadusol as a new sunscreen ingredient, enable its commercial production, and provide essential safety data prior to initiating clinical testing required for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the redefinition of the care of asthma patients. Asthma is highly prevalent in the US, with 25 million patients currently suffering symptoms, and was the cause of 1.7 million emergency room visits in 2015, resulting in a huge societal cost. A predictive platform that can identify when a patient is at risk of an asthma attack would serve to reduce such costs by allowing intervention in a timely manner, thereby reducing the number of emergency room visits by asthma patients. Through the combination of remote monitoring of patient lung function, local environmental sensing, and data analytics, asthma can be understood at a personalized scale, a dramatic shift in the standard of care for this chronic and complex condition. Additionally, the platform developed in this project can be expanded to other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or cystic fibrosis, broadening its impact. Ultimately, it is envisioned that this project will result in a world without asthma attacks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the development of a machine learning-based data analytics platform to identify in advance when asthma patients are at risk of an asthma attack, thereby enabling physicians to alter a patient's care plan and avoid hospitalization. To date, there is no integrated system to gather and analyze high-quality lung function and environmental data for asthma patients on a daily basis in order to truly analyze and predict a patient's health. As a result, asthma care is often reactive, requiring emergency treatment and resulting in poor clinical outcomes. The objectives of this Phase II research include the development and validation of a machine-learning based analytics model to generate new insights into the health of asthma patients; the development and implementation of a physician portal to translate such insights into clinical outcomes; and the development of new datasets to create a more robust and accurate platform. The result will be a live prediction platform to assist physicians in keeping asthma patients out of the emergency room.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make on-site hydrogen generation convenient and economically viable. Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure.  One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer.  The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype.  The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity.  The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve measurement science.  Currently, special low-pressure chambers known as "vapor cells" are made by hand in a select number of precision glassblowing shops and suffer from poor dimensional reproducibility, low production capacity, irregular sizes, and variable vapor composition leading to a multifaceted limitation in the marketplace. Optical frequency references on the market today are large, costly, and power-hungry, but are used in a variety of commercial opportunities throughout industrial metrology markets. This study aims to produce a repeatable recipe suitable for high-volume production of miniature vapor cells. The results of this study will lead to the scalable production of references that would be intrinsically trustworthy and perform well in a continuous manner over many years.

    This STTR Phase I project will leverage micromachining of glass and silicon to enable a new fabrication method for a traditionally handmade component: a glass-blown vapor cell. The research objective of this study is to test if such a method can yield a compact and reproducible vapor cell. Research will employ semiconductor processing techniques and optical frequency metrology to deduce the long-term stability and accuracy of these vapor cells in order to assess their suitability as optical frequency references. The anticipated technical results of this study include a potential pathway to a mass-produced optical frequency standard suitable for optical clocks, interferometers, and wavemeters. Such a technology would underpin accurate measurement science in high-performance optical measurement equipment.

    \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is a diagnostic product that addresses\

    \ drugs to reduce the risk of blood clots that can lead to significant adverse\
    \ events, such as stroke. However, DOACs are part of the leading class of drugs\
    \ implicated in adverse event-related emergency department visits. These adverse\

    \ exposure to blood products, platelet repletion, reversal therapies, and additional\
    \ complications (e.g. infection, sepsis, multiple organ failure) driving longer\
    \ hospitalizations, higher mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. In\
    \ emergency situations, the rapid detection of DOAC anticoagulation is needed\
    \ when planning for urgent care for surgery, serious trauma, drug overdose, emergency\
    \ procedures, or monitoring for drug accumulation in cases of renal and liver\
    \ failure.  This project proposes a diagnostic at the point of care. With an estimated\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a wider adoption of autonomous technologies among residential buildings. This research proposes evaluating the use of advanced sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable inexpensive hardware infrastructures to control the conditions in indoor space autonomously. This technology fits well within the capacity of residential buildings. One main benefit of indoor automation is deep energy savings. The Department of Energy estimates a 5% reduction of the country's total energy bill if existing residential buildings save 25% of their energy consumption. The autonomous controller evaluated in this project has the potential to reach this goal, saving the nation up to $63 billion and the planet 284 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Alongside energy efficiency, the associated societal benefits of the proposed project can potentially save lives. The technologies may spur a higher level of security protection among many unprotected residential spaces. Additionally, tracking occupants’ habits may enable alerts to caregivers or family members in critical emergency situations. This can be beneficial for the aging population that wants to stay within the comfort of their own home.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the scientific knowledge required to approach full autonomous control in indoor spaces. The use of advanced perception sensors in buildings will be evaluated. Their rich data stream will be utilized to develop advanced algorithms for autonomous control of indoor spaces. Advances in sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms will be used to instigate technological evolution in autonomous building systems.  A proof of concept will be developed to mitigate the unique risks associated caused by applying autonomous control in indoor spaces, specifically: achieving advanced perception, self-programmability, and reliability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to apply low-cost radiofrequency (RF) sensing hardware to detect, monitor, and localize transmitters in industrial and urban environments. This technology can solve key problems in manufacturing and logistics operations such as finding RF transmitters that are interfering with operations or monitoring the health of radio systems. These activities are required in modern industrial environments as increasing numbers of critical systems rely on radio communications to operate. In urban environments, automating the tasks of detecting, monitoring, and localizing transmitters can simplify the management of large-scale radio networks and gather critical data on wireless device usage. Increased instances of intentional jamming and the rollout of new communications standards such as 5G make these tasks critical to the modern city. Traditionally, such monitoring tasks are conducted manually with expensive spectrum monitoring equipment. Automated installations also utilize expensive sensors, making automated spectrum monitoring only feasible in safety-critical areas such as around airports. Lower-cost sensors can be installed permanently at a high density for almost any application, allowing cities and smaller industrial customers to deploy persistent monitoring networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy high-density networks of low-cost sensors, determine the efficacy of existing detection and localization algorithms as applied to the network, and evaluate novel machine-learning (ML) algorithms for similar tasks. This project will also mitigate the technical risk of deploying such a system by characterizing how well commodity software-defined radio (SDR) hardware can perform across a variety of operational environments. No high-density and large-scale test networks of inexpensive radio hardware have been deployed for the purposes of industrial and urban spectrum monitoring, so data gathered throughout this SBIR Phase I project will be useful in evaluating the viability of this approach. By evaluating ML algorithms for signal detection and localization, this project can help determine how effective machine learning models can be at ingesting RF data from low-cost sensors and synthesizing actionable outputs about the radio environment. The result of this project will be an analysis of the detection and localization performance of a variety of algorithms across different environments and sensor node densities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable nanofiber integration in a wide variety of applications that were previously cost prohibitive. The technology will enable both the cost-efficient production of nanofibers at commercially acceptable rates, as well as the development of unique nanofiber materials with properties compatible with specific industry uses.  The high-capacity batteries developed as part of this effort may give rise to advancements in the energy industry enabling electricity distribution via microgrids and solar arrays, in turn supporting energy resilience, independence, and sustainability. Further, the commercialization of this technology platform for facile nanofiber production at scale may create prospects for nanofiber use across a multitude of industries, such as: textiles for fine-mesh surgical face masks and thermal regulating clothing, remediation of water and air, tissue engineering and wound care, and defense applications such as low-weight aircraft, bulletproof uniforms, and personal protective equipment for  use against chemical/biological agents.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a low cost, high-throughput process to fabricate nanofibers with unique properties, enabling their integration into a variety of end applications. Traditional DC electrospinning methods have low nanofiber production rates, preventing their widespread adoption. This project develops an alternating field electrospinning (AFES) process capable of producing a wide variety of unique nanofibers at a rate thousands of times faster than existing systems. Phase I research objectives include: the characterization of different thermal settings for AFES electrospinning and studies of the impacts on material properties, the expansion of classes of materials compatible with the AFES system, and the fabrication of materials with application-specific properties.  This work will involve extensive testing and characterization of nanofibers produced under a variety of thermal process settings.  The researchers will also incorporate the nanofibers into lithium ion batteries to quantify capabilities and identify optimal silicon nanofiber characteristics for the application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the weight and increase the efficiency of today's ground vehicles.  Replacing steel with structural composites, a foam core wrapped in carbon fiber and resin, is a key strategy to reduce vehicular structural weight and to increase efficiency and safety. Current foam cores often exhibit low performance and are costly to produce for non-planar designs. As a result, three-dimensional cored composites remain cost-prohibitive for mass-manufactured automobiles and relegated to niche, high-performance vehicles. Improving core performance and fabrication processes will unlock high volume manufacturing of structural composites and enable manufacturers to increase the efficiency of their fleet by up to 40% throughout the next decade. Such a step-improvement in manufacturability can also accelerate urban air mobility vehicles and electric aircraft development and deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of a novel, high throughput additive manufacturing technology for three-dimensional, thermosetting polymer foam parts featuring unique, specific mechanical properties (strength-to-weight or stiffness-to-weight ratios). Combining a unique 3D printing nozzle for thermosetting polymers, material science, and robotics enables unlocking on-demand and the rapid production of net shape, complex foam parts to be incorporated into existing supply chains. The project will develop and test novel resin formulations, optimize material synthesis and deposition, and enable the control of foam microstructure in situ. Using this latter feature, coupled with topology-optimization software, the project will produce the first foam metamaterials. These unique metamaterials will be mechanically and thermally tested using American Society for Testing and Materials standards to ensure the processing meets industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is further advancement and maturation of a recently devised miniature electromechanical actuator technology with potential applications in the consumer electronics, automotive and biomedical industries.  Any electrically powered system with moving parts requires actuators converting electrical energy into mechanical motion.  This includes robots, surgical/medical micro-devices, precision micro/nano-positioning systems, and optical and ultrasonic imaging systems among others.  The market size for millimeter-scale electromechanical actuators embedded in compact camera modules (CCM) for Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Auto-Focusing (AF) alone is currently over $3B and expected to reach over $5B by 2025.  The same actuator technology can also be applied to a variety of other applications such as compact speakers, ultrasonic transducers, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project utilizes the newly established cellular electrostatic actuator technology to demonstrate a low cost, power efficient, high-performance solution for auto-focusing and optical image stabilization in compact camera modules.  Physical movement of the lens stack with respect to the image sensor is essential in cameras for Auto-Focusing (AF) as well as shake cancellation via Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).  Voice Coil Motors (VCM) currently used to address such functionalities are relatively bulky, slow, power hungry, and costly.  Enabled by the state-of-the-art micromachining techniques, force generating ultra-narrow electrostatic gaps within the proposed actuators offer high work output per volume with close to 100% energy efficiency.  Under this project, for realization of a viable product prototype, mechanical displacement amplifiers and shock absorbing structures will be designed and integrated within the silicon chips along with the actuators.  Comprehensive mechanical shock tests on loaded actuators as well as long-term electrical reliability and mechanical durability tests will be performed on the fabricated prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable electronic products of great environmental benefit and social value which cannot be economically made today. Among these are three important product classes that can deliver on the promise of the connection of everyday devices via internet (Internet of Things) and their rapid computing power. First, wearable devices (such as smart watches, health monitors, or activity trackers) must be smaller, thinner (often flexible) and less power-hungry than current versions. Second, low-power, high resolution displays with high brightness are needed to visualize results, even in direct sunlight. Third, the decentralized computers which collect, manage and process large datasets require designs that can easily manage sensors, process information, and control devices to support smart cities, smart vehicles, smart homes, and smart applications. The primary focus of this project is to enable the next generation of advanced displays, capable of substantial energy savings coupled with greater visual appeal. Broadly, the results are critical for enabling the cost-effective manufacturing of each of the three product classes, which all suffer from fundamental challenges in chip manufacturing and require innovation in packaging and assembly to be commercially viable at scale.

    The proposed project is designed primarily to make better displays possible. There is a widespread desire to make displays with ultrasmall light-emitting diodes (LEDs), enabling better contrast and color, sunlight viewability, longer lifetimes, lower power consumption, and lower cost. To do so, currently unsolved chip fabrication obstacles must be overcome. The main impediment is a cost-effective approach to place such small LEDs at desired pixel positions with adequate precision. The objective of the project is to meet this need, using a unique non-contact photopolymer-based method which transfers <10 um die with +/- 2 um accuracy at many thousands of units per second with high yield. The research will involve systematic study of the parameters of the process, including polymer composition and characteristics, film characteristics, pre-transfer bonding process parameters (temperature, pressure and time), and optical system parameters. Yield will be measured statistically and improved. While demonstrating actual throughput requires full-scale production equipment, the feasibility of meeting industry required targets will be demonstrated to the extent possible on lab-scale equipment.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals as well as enable large scale field monitoring and management in production agriculture.  The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to establish autonomous data collection under-canopy from field crops using a low-cost ground robot. The proposed work will enhance the ability to collect data autonomously in full-scale crop-breeding fields throughout the season and enable on-site data analytics for remote sites with limited connectivity. Long-term field adaptive autonomy will be achieved through implementation of multiple low-cost sensors. Robot's real-time control algorithms will be developed to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under-canopy field environments. Finally, the research will develop hardware specific edge-compute versions of the analytics algorithms to enable on-site data analysis. These innovations will together enable global deployment of the system for effective data collection and phenotyping.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project entails the development of a simple and affordable saliva-based test that will enable the detection of early Alzheimer's disease. Today, there is no single test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Because the diagnosis is complex, invasive, and expensive, these tests are only performed once symptoms, such as memory loss, begin to manifest. These symptoms of Alzheimer's disease only become apparent once the disease has already cause significant damage to the brain. The proposed test will be widely accessible and detect the disease before symptoms arise, enabling the patient to start active prevention strategies and even therapies to preserve brain health. As the American population ages — nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 years of age or older by 2060 — Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are becoming a great challenge for health and social care. As part of a broad approach to prevention, this technology can potentially extend early Alzheimer’s care to millions of Americans, allowing interventions, monitoring, and treatment initiation years earlier than what is currently possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is applying sophisticated chemical analysis methods to develop a novel test to detect signs of early Alzheimer’s disease using a person’s saliva. Diseases can cause changes in the biochemical composition of body fluids such as blood or saliva. Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer’s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a lightweight, ultra-compact 3D sensor offering enhanced performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. Existing sensors on consumer electronic devices, such as those on augmented/virtual reality headsets, are limited in their perception accuracy and detection range resulting in a poor user experience, which has limited their implementation. The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities. This effort also supports domestic photonics manufacturing and assembly industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seeks to develop a novel 3D sensor design that promises performance enhancement over state-of-the-art devices. Building on a proprietary flat optics technology, the project may lead to a 3D sensor module featuring panoramic vision, significant spatial resolution improvements, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and a compact, lightweight architecture amenable to low-cost manufacturing and assembly. The project has two main goals: 1) demonstration of a 3D sensor prototype and experimental validation of its performance and 2) development of scalable manufacturing routes for fabrication of flat optics components leveraging standard microfabrication technologies.

The application addresses a need to find the optimal way of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries.  The technology may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers more cost competitive.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times, and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to accelerate the transition from chemical pesticides to non-chemical alternatives by providing farmers with a sustainable, long-term solution for managing pests, while reducing agricultural impacts on human health and the environment. Today, strawberry farmers are reliant on chemical pesticides, spending $2,500/acre on over 60,000 acres/year to support the $3.6 billion U.S. strawberry industry. Organic farms, representing 10% of the industry, lack effective treatment methods resulting in high labor costs and increased risk of yield loss. This project seeks to develop a system for using ultraviolet light as an efficient and equally effective alternative for chemical pesticides, disrupting the pesticide manufacturing industry by providing farmers with a healthier and more environmentally conscious method for treating crops. The solution may eliminate uncertainty associated with chemical applications, reduce labor requirements, and increase profitability for farmers. Additionally, technologies developed as part of this project will minimize human exposure to chemical pesticides and reduce the ecological damage caused by existing agricultural treatment practices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel, non-chemical treatment system for commercialization of agricultural pest control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical pesticides, a global $84 billion market. Existing pest controls are ineffective due to insect resistance, cause uncertainty, and result in reduced yield and profitability. This project’s objective is to create a reliable, non-chemical treatment alternative that uses ultraviolet (UV-C) light to control multiple pests effectively and sustainably. The project team will build a UV-C treatment device with a dosing control algorithm for achieving reliable pest control in minimum treatment time. This dosing controller will use novel volumetric irradiance profiles to characterize the effectiveness of a treatment and adjust treatment time and/or distance to account for field uncertainties. The goal of this research is be a commercial UV-C treatment system integrated into an automated pest control system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II is to improve schedule-based maintenance programs to ensure that industrial and farming equipment can function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The downtime associated with such high productivity equipment can result in significant lost revenue, and research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. The proposed technology seeks to effectively reduce or eliminate this downtime, creating value for manufacturers. This project proposes a novel deep learning approach to predicting bearing failure in rotating industrial equipment and enable maintenance teams to confidently plan optimal maintenance activities around equipment that is in the process of degrading. This solution also aims to cost-effectively use a patented methodology to monitor industrial material handling systems with a combination of stationary and mobile battery-powered wireless sensors.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes a novel deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. Monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. The proposed approach may not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but also seeks to quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions may be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Additionally, many existing deep learning approaches also lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where poor predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This technology may allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden\
    \ created by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding. \
    \ ED crowding is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been\
    \ associated with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,\
    \ EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients\
    \ visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record\
    \ (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict\
    \ clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing\
    \ the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the\
    \ root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight\
    \ is expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient\
    \ progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly\
    \ translate to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase\
    \ II project should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology\
    \ while promoting the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare.\
    \ \n\n \n\nThe proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by\
    \ advancing the data-science, decision-science, and operations research that underpins\
    \ our decision support technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination\
    \ of data normalization, feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods\
    \ to predict clinical events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.\
    \  This includes a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow)\
    \ to predict risk of critical events to empower safe separation of service streams\
    \ for acutely ill and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near\
    \ hospital discharge (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide\
    \ prioritization of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream\
    \ capacity and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting.\
    \ The proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to\
    \ hospitals individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances.\
    \ The technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about\
    \ how to consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.\
    \  The specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology\
    \ by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance\
    \ monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient\
    \ progression."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.

    This proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the most common problems with complex prosthetic hands: lack of robustness, lack of waterproofing, lack of sensory feedback, and high cost. This project will advance the development of waterproof multi-articulated hands with a touch feedback system, offering an affordable solution to restore confidence and independence to over 10 million amputees worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the work done in Phase I to develop an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. The work in this proposal will involve advanced mechanical design techniques necessary for waterproofing a multi-articulated prosthetic hand. Additionally, the project will advance the development of a variable grip strength, semi-automatic contact reflex system to improve the range of manipulation tasks possible with upper limb prosthetic devices. Technical tasks include: 1) development of contact reflexes through integration of position control, pressure sensing interface, and speed control for both fine, compliant manipulation of delicate objects and gross manipulation of objects requiring high grip force; 2) waterproofing to an IP67 rating, a significant technical challenge because of the many potential points of ingress and required level of manufacturing precision;  3) the mobile application user interface; and 4) standardization for manufacturing at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be on public health, with the proposed "e-CHEM" solution enabling the monitoring of chemical water quality with high temporal resolution, providing early alerts when quality degrades. The World Health Organization has recognized water chemical safety risk management as essential for ensuring public health. By informing water utilities and end-users early on about problems in the drinking water quality or in the distribution infrastructure, the duration of poor tap water quality episodes can be drastically reduced. For the industrial sector, e-CHEM will measure wastewater contamination, allowing its effective treatment and reuse and limiting fresh source water use particularly in regions affected by drought. e-CHEM will have major commercial impact across multiple industries,  minimizing costs, reducing liabilities, and improving health.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to commercialize the e-CHEM analyzer developed and pilot-tested in Phase I to provide a complete data analytics solution for performing water quality monitoring autonomously in critical applications where lack of infrastructure (power, communications), location remoteness, or limited human resources currently impose severe constraints. e-CHEM uses novel reagent-based and reagent-less lab-on-chip sensor technology to continuously quantify multiple water contaminants within a highly-miniaturized instrument, with accuracy and sensitivity levels approaching and even surpassing current laboratory capabilities. This Phase II project will involve a combination of fundamental and applied research aimed at improving the e-CHEM prototype for environmental variations during field operations, optimizing and ruggedizing the system for user operations, and developing machine learning algorithms for data analytics. After full validation of e-CHEM technology for drinking water, the e-CHEM system will also be adapted for harsh environments, such as monitoring of industrial wastewater from unconventional oil-and-gas operations.

    The broader impact/commercial opportunity of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from creating a paradigmatic shift in the way we achieve seismic protection. The use of mechanical metamaterials fosters new opportunities to increase current levels of seismic protection of buildings and infrastructure, which could ultimately increase the resilience of communities and save lives. Mechanical metamaterials are materials specifically designed to have unprecedented properties. Evolving from a traditional system-based design to a material-based design has the potential of creating seismic solutions that are more customizable and easier to install than most of the current technologies. This technology could replace current seismic protection systems that are traditionally aimed at saving building occupants' lives, but may not address the important equipment therein.  An enhanced level of seismic protection constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities and services requiring continuity of operations after earthquakes. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of increasing the resiliency of communities in seismic prone areas and reduce seismic related direct and indirect losses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for increasing the seismic resilience of our critical infrastructure, and in particular Information Technology (IT) facilities. The projects will result in a revolutionary advance in the seismic protection of vibration sensitive electronic equipment through the use of novel mechanical metamaterials made with an innovative hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) process. The feasibility of combining multiple AM processes to manufacture the multi-component internal architecture of such metamaterials will be demonstrated. In particular, the effectiveness of AM processes in combining hard and soft materials in a highly-complex architecture will be addressed, with the aim of enhancing the design space of the mechanical metamaterial. The effects of this enlarged designed space on the seismic resilience of IT facilities will be investigated by developing a specific seismic resilience framework. The framework will be used to analyze and compare the seismic resilience of data centers with traditional systems and highly customizable metamaterials, as resulting from the manufacturing process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to detect social-emotional issues in children (ages 5-12) for early intervention. A growing trend in juvenile mental health concerns was exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruption in child development. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) system that learns from interactions with the child and parent independently and can detect potential social-emotional concerns.  The ML system enables personalized evaluation and monitoring outside a clinical setting in a remote or hybrid context.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances algorithms for integration into a social-emotional skill building curriculum.  The project proposes: 1) User segmentation based on a comprehensive assessment of social-emotional functioning, 2) Correlation of the relevancy and effectiveness of modules to segmented users, and 3) Collection of information to identify social emotional deficits (red flags). These activities enable a feedback loop to learn and deliver recommendations for each child-parent dyad, personalizing learning in real-time. These algorithms learn from behavioral, social, and emotional inputs from both the parent and child when they engage with the technology. The system will also detect red flags correlated with social and emotional deficits, promoting early intervention.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a state-of-the-art, counterfeit-proof security technology to enable vaccine manufacturers to tag, track, and authenticate vaccine products throughout the supply chain. The tagging process will be amenable to its integration into a scalable glass vial manufacturing process. Digital information such as product, lot number, expiry, etc. may be embedded into the tags, if desired. In light of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, security and authentication of vaccine dosages throughout the supply chain represents a significant public health and global logistics challenge. Industry concerns over vaccine theft and counterfeit products drive the market need for an effective ID security technology that enable manufacturers to authenticate vaccines in a safe, covert, and efficient manner. The tagging process developed in this program will add minimal expenses to the manufacturing cost of each vaccine dosage form, at an estimated cost of pennies per dose.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will require the completion of several tasks, including: 1) the computational design of the taggant patterns, 2) the development of a scalable tagging process, 3) the development of instrumentation and associated software for tag authentication, and 4) the encryption of tags with digital information such as lot number, expiry, manufacturing location, or any other desired product information. In summary, the specific design parameters of the tag will be elucidated and optimized during this Phase I effort. The design parameters will subsequently be demonstrated on flat glass and glass vaccine vial prototypes using a scalable process. Finally, newly developed “reading” instrumentation will be used to authenticate the tagged glass prototypes, demonstrating the overall utility of this anti-counterfeit technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of modular power sub-systems (power-stacks) that will enable a new generation of power inverters that are compact, re-usable, upgradable, resilient against die-supply shortages, and can be manufactured faster and cheaper. As the world migrates to sources of clean energy and the further electrification of industry, transportation, and homes, there is a significant and growing demand for electric power converters. Widespread adoption of clean energy requires that these converters be simple, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Today's designs are inconvenient both for end customers and for converter suppliers, as they typically are: complex, large, heavy, inflexible, expensive, and slow to market.  Current inverter are often made by only a few specialized companies and  have high technical barriers to entry for inexperienced entrants. Additionally, current inverters are locked to power-die suppliers, making scale-up and  re-use challenging. The proposed project will develop and test a novel approach to enable inverters to meet new market demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel approach to power conversion problems.  High speed operation of high-power semiconductor switches typically generates significant heat.  The novelty of the proposed innovation  over current technologies resides in moving the point of electrical isolation from adjacent to the power-die to adjacent to the coolant, and massively integrating the power path, the control path and thermal path into scalable building blocks.  An additional advantage is the ability to develop new manufacturing processes to build and integrate these blocks reliably. The outcomes of this project may be a design and manufacturing approach that results in 50% reduced development time and development cost, 80% lower weight and size, a $100-$200 per unit cost reduction, increased scalability, and improved resilience to die-supply shortages.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make 3D cameras for long-range LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) more affordable, widespread, and as reliable and simple to use as cameras found in common mobile devices. 3D cameras (LiDAR) are being used for precise positioning and velocity determination of objects in augmented reality applications and are crucial for widespread adoption of autonomous cars and trucks where the 200-300 meter range is required. Eye safety concerns with low-cost silicon sensors force the long-range autonomous vehicle customers to use one pixel at the time or limited field of view imaging using high-cost and complex systems based on materials that require specialty materials and manufacturing. This technology will enable the use of mainstream materials and process technology for the long-range autonomous vehicle segment without compromising eye safety. This capability will reduce cost, lower complexity, and improve reliability of long-range 3D cameras and help propel the autonomous vehicle industry into widespread adoption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a fully complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatible single photon avalanche diode (SPADs) based on germanium that operates at eye safe wavelengths. Current germanium-based avalanche photodiodes require cryogenic cooling due to excessive dark noise from tunneling or dislocations.  They suffer from poor absorption at the eye safe wavelengths beyond 1450 nm. This project will implement a photon trapping strained heterostructure device architecture which reduces dark counts while enhancing absorption at the operating wavelength. The device structure will be developed with particular emphasis on the semiconductor growth process. The experimental results will be benchmarked to the dark count and absorption requirements for the mass-market, long-range autonomous vehicle application. The technology will offer a highly manufacturable, lower cost alternative to compound semiconductor based SPADs that are often prohibitively expensive to produce in large arrays.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase II project will be achieved through investigating approaches to leverage extended reality (XR) for immersive, interactive and intelligent training in manufacturing, healthcare and higher education, to accelerate learning, increase engagement, and foster more effective use of expensive equipment. In 2017, the global training market was estimated to be $388 B, while the US market was estimated to be $166 B. Training and design use cases frequently rank among the top 5 XR use cases in industry reports, and the enterprise VR training market alone is forecasted to grow at 140% year over year for the next five years to reach $6.3 B per year. XR technologies hold significant potential by providing users with a sense of presence and immersion heretofore not possible due to cost, safety, security, physical, geographical or other limitations. This project will pursue this growing market opportunity with content expected to bring together classrooms, labs, factories, hospitals and field service environments, broadly advancing learning and engagement in both schools and workplaces.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project lies in the development of high- fidelity modular and reusable virtual object and assembly models, customized models for scenarios, tasks, instructions and user proficiency, application of natural language processing techniques to enable conversational interactions in immersive multiplayer environments and the use of computer vision techniques to support effective reuse of content across both virtual and augmented reality settings. Specialized modules will be developed for each of the above functionalities and then integrated to develop an innovative, easy-to-use product that will make it easy for non-programmers to author and publish XR content for training, design, service and other use cases, as well as collect data to evaluate the content and experiences. Pilot testing will be conducted with users in the higher education industry to rigorously evaluate and iteratively refine the technologies and the final product. By judiciously combining XR, virtual objects, and simulations with voice, vision and collaboration, this project aims to build an innovative product that may enable anyone to build engaging knowledge-rich content.

    \ and factory automation.  Such robots can enable functions such as scanning and\
    \ reconstruction of the environment, or also “pick and place” at high throughput\

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop of a safe and curative, minimally\
    \ invasive procedure leading to long-lasting outcomes for patients with varicocele.\
    \ Varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility and is also associated\
    \ with testicular pain, erectile disfunction, and low free testosterone. Varicocele\
    \ affects approximately 30 million men in the US alone and is the direct cause\
    \ of over 1.5 million infertile couples. Current methods of treatment have low\
    \ success rates, with only 50% of patients noticing > 50% improvement in sperm\
    \ parameters and up to 37% of patients showing no change after treatment. The\
    \ treatment for varicocele has not changed since 1929 and consists of ligation\
    \ or occlusion of the internal spermatic vein, the primary route of drainage for\
    \ the testis. Even though surgical ligation procedures have shown promising clinical\
    \ efficacy, the technical difficulty in performing the procedures and low success\
    \ rates leave room for improvement. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research\
    \ (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to leverage a highly effective procedure proposed\
    \ to treat varicocele. This procedure was proposed in the 1980s and was based\
    \ on an advanced understanding of hemodynamics responsible for pathophysiology\
    \ of varicocele. Through initial studies, this procedure showed groundbreaking\
    \ results and has been used in multiple independent studies to treat patients\
    \ with close to 100% success rates. Additionally, the complication rates are significantly\
    \ lower, with complete elimination of hydrocele formation, recurrence rates of\
    \ < 0.2% and faster recovery times. However, this procedure has not caught widespread\
    \ adoption due to the high skill required to perform this procedure. This SBIR\
    \ project seeks to develop a technology that will lower the barrier to perform\
    \ the highly challenging procedure, thereby making the procedure a reality for\
    \ patients of varicocele and infertility. The resulting device may afford patients\
    \ the benefits of surgery, without the risk, ultimately reducing overall cost\
    \ of care associated with patients of infertility.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project includes reductions in food waste, energy use, and carbon emissions by developing a highly efficient and adaptable system for refrigerated transport. Mini-containers, which are small, insulated boxes with environments controlled by a central driving unit that contains a refrigerator and other environmental controls are proposed. The technology may increase the economic feasibility of small farms by allowing them to target a more resilient, efficient, and potentially carbon-neutral cold supply chain. The potential impact of the research includes improved availability of nutritious food for the general population and mitigation of negative environmental effects of cold logistics. Additionally, mitigating food waste will create savings up and down the supply chain.

    Two key technical challenges are addressed in this research. The first area has, as its main objective, the development of a volume-adaptable refrigeration system that allows for the efficient operation of several levels of control to best adapt to high levels of cooling capacity needs. The second area of research corresponds to the development of the methodology and solutions algorithms to exercise a hybrid control strategy for the optimal scheduling operation of the refrigeration system. The archetype refrigeration system would be subject to constraints imposed by the heterogeneous loads stored in the different special storage and transportation units known as mini-containers which receive cooling and other environmental services.  This technology will allow for efficiently aggregating, storing, disaggregating, and distributing fresh products in the mini-containers. The mini-containers will allow the emergence of efficient cold logistics for small loads by enabling the capacity of large transportation containers to be split among multiple conveyances. The proposed solution will also make it possible to convert almost any truck into a refrigerated truck and any warehouse into a cold storage facility, supporting the emergence of sharing economies in cold logistics.
