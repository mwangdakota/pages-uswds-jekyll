    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to significantly reduce the number of injuries or deaths suffered by pavement marking workers on public streets and roads, while increasing the efficiency and lowering costs by using an operator-driven, truck-mounted, mobile robotic pavement marking system. Robotic painting allows workers to remain in the safety of the truck cab, protecting them from traffic.  Increased efficiency will help to minimize work zone congestion and duration, while reduced costs will enable safer and more productive streetscapes for the general public. Studies have repeatedly confirmed that streetscapes with a high density of transverse marking features such as shared center turning lanes, dedicated bike lanes with separation buffer zones, and pedestrian-friendly crosswalks result in measurable public health benefits, enhanced quality of life, increased commercial activity, and, counterintuitively, more efficient traffic flow with fewer collisions. The project will also better enable precise placement of new markings and precise overpainting of worn or eroded markings, both important factors for connected and autonomous vehicles. An earlier phase of the project has already resulted in enhancements to camera calibration techniques for machine vision.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to build on a successful Phase I effort to enable a commercially-viable robotic road painting system that addresses the need to protect the lives of human workers engaged in the dangerous task of stenciling roadway markings such as turn arrows or bike symbols. The project may also improve the accuracy and ease of application of markings needed to support autonomous vehicle-ready roadways. The research will apply advanced software, machine vision, an augmented-reality user interface, and proprietary robotic trajectory planning technologies to support ultraprecision painting in the real-world environment while keeping human workers safe in the cab of the operator-driven truck upon which the robot is mounted. The solution will enable robots to paint previously unmarked pavement and to repaint existing marks. The combined hardware and software solution will be capable of recording all planned and completed markings in a cloud-hosted database—an innovation that will streamline the processes.  The technology will also form a cloud-based standard for mapping and recording universal road markings and support the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate safely. While much of the research can initially be performed in simulation, significant real-world testing and validation will be required as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II is to improve the mobility of wheelchair users.  There are more than 2.5 M wheelchair users in the US. This project will develop an electronic aftermarket add-on accessory to increase manual wheelchair users’ height up to 18 inches or more in 5 seconds. The new wheelchair lift (WL) will increase their Quality of Life and their ability to independently perform activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, dressing) and instrumental activities of daily living (transportation, shopping, cooking, doing laundry, and housework). The solution will replace expensive home retrofitting ($20 K) and will reduce the need for help in outside settings, such as reaching for items on shelves, empowering the users. The WL will bridge the gap between the disabled and the able-bodied population, providing a means to increase wheelchair users’ participation in the labor force (currently only 20%) and enabling more employment options. Similarly, the WL will offer employers an effective way to support workers with disabilities and reduce costs to adapt the work environment to provide reasonable accommodations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to generate a final functional prototype of the wheelchair lift (WL) ready for usability tests with end-users. The Phase II project extends prior work on a prototype satisfying the major design specifications of weight, lift maximum load, and time of ascension, de-risking the most significant technological challenges associated with the project. The proposed activities will enable systems engineering of hardware and electronics development and the next generation prototype for testing and regulatory clearance. The prototype will be produced under Quality Management Systems and an industrial manufacturing process will be established.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the prevalence of severe diabetic foot ulcers. These ulcers affect one-fourth of patients with diabetes over their lifetimes, significantly impacting mobility and life expectancy. When treatment for an ulcer is too late, the only option is often amputation; in fact, diabetic foot ulcers account for the majority of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Reducing the incidence of severe ulcers will improve the health and welfare of the American public as well as mitigate the economic burden of diabetes on the American healthcare system. By some estimates, treatment for diabetic foot ulcers accounts for one-third of all direct diabetic healthcare spending. Therefore, preventing these ulcers would save the US healthcare system tens of billions of dollars per year. The proposed solution will monitor foot ulcers consistently to prevent further damage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a computer vision system for detecting and monitoring diabetic foot ulcers with an imaging device. The current standard of care is for patients to inspect their own feet visually every day, but these inspections happen inconsistently and unreliably. If successful, this system will automatically identify patients’ feet consistently across several days and lighting conditions. It will classify late-stage wounds, allowing physicians to monitor progression or healing of ulcers. Further, it will estimate the risk of future ulcers, enabling early-stage intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve vertical farms. The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density.

    This SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement.  Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to address critical health, safety, cost and energy challenges in recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) disinfection. Growing high quality protein at larger scales cannot be done with current animal husbandry techniques without generating excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Intensive RAS technologies offer a viable alternative because they are capable of producing high quality protein with minimal impact on the environment.  Protecting the health of the fish is one of the key limitations to a more rapid growth of this industry.  This project will improve food production at scale. Furthermore, the proposed technology may be applied to drinking water.

    This STTR Phase I project will advance a technology for safe and low-energy bacteria disinfection in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) by using a durable, low-cost method to generate singlet oxygen, an excited-state form of molecular oxygen.  Ozone and ultraviolet light are mainstay disinfectants in the fish farm industry, but they are expensive, energy-intensive and can be toxic to fish and personnel; motivating advances in safe, low-energy disinfection.  Singlet oxygen is a powerful disinfecting agent lethal to pathogens and harmless to fish and humans. The primary innovation of this project allows singlet oxygen to be generated at high efficiency without contaminating the water as it is not persistent. This project will conduct engineering studies as a function of both chemical structure and mass transport of reactants and products.  Detailed models will be developed to determine the appropriate dimensions of the disinfection system as well as understand the interactions between singlet oxygen and pathogens.  These models will be the first to couple transport phenomena with absorption/desorption kinetics in this configuration for RAS.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to allow America’s grape industry to reduce crop losses due to spring frost, estimated at over $1 billion per year, as well as related job losses – more than 11,000 individuals in the State of Washington alone.  The encapsulating bud break delay technology and predictive analytics support farmers with decision making tools ahead of impending frost events during bud break season.  Such tools may enable rural communities to achieve economic stability by decreasing yield losses and lowering production costs.  The technology fills gaps in knowledge needed to make informed decisions on individual farms, resulting in better management decisions in the face of increasing complexities of spring freeze threats. Additionally, use of the encapsulation technology may reduce carbon emissions and water usage from current fossil fuel-intensive conventional frost mitigation measures such as burners, wind machines and sprinklers.

    The proposed encapsulating bud break delay technology involves two main advances. First, a gel encapsulation spray biologically delays the process of bud break consistently up to 14 days and increases cold resistance up to 6 degrees Celsius. Second, to guide growers in delivering this product, a Decision Support System (DSS) aids grape growers in deciding when it is necessary to mitigate pending frost conditions. The Phase II project focuses on increasing the predictive accuracy of the DSS and scaling the system. Specifically, the team will focus on: a) optimizing the formulation and testing in the lab, b) field-testing and data collection at five sites, c) enhancing DSS capabilities with additional data and analysis, d) scaling up for large-scale manufacture and application, and e) gathering data for regulatory approvals. This gel encapsulation solution for frost protection of vineyards may find future applications in other fruits crops such as apples and stones fruits that are even more susceptible to spring frost damage than grapes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help more amputees walk safely with less effort. Approximately 800,000 individuals live with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. The 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee have two options:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The first option requires that the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter does so automatically but cost $30,000-100,000 and requires physical qualification, limiting the availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with any leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. This project will explore the trade space of mechanical and analytical capabilities.  This project will validate intuitive movement and universal stability for above-knee amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work will advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    \ then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity\

    \ the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically\
    \ the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the\
    \ implementation of high-performing photoreactors employing robust photocatalysts\

    \ to chemical processing on an industrial scale, including CO2 conversion. This\
    \ technology will enable large-scale processes and has the potential for an extensive\
    \ societal impact by reducing CO2 emissions that affect climate change. The technology\
    \ will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential\
    \ products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes and businesses where\
    \ VOCs pose health risks. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve indoor\
    \ air quality in industrial settings by developing a photocatalytic technology\
    \ platform that enables efficient and effective VOC removal. The technology will\
    \ be particularly valuable in the presence of low-level contamination where alternative\
    \ technologies are expensive, poorly performing, and adversely affect the environment.\
    \ Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants.\
    \ When activated by light, their surfaces become chemically active via formation\
    \ of reactive oxygen species, which decompose toxic VOCs. The objectives of this\
    \ project are to overcome the key drawbacks of commercially available photocatalysts\
    \ that inhibit their widespread use in industrial environments. Previous photocatalysts\
    \ form by-products and intermediates, which may be toxic or which can contaminate\
    \ the photocatalyst. Those products are powder-based, leading to shedding and\
    \ high attrition. The proposed research will develop a photocatalyst and photoreactor\
    \ systems that provide efficient light coupling and enable rapid reaction rates.\
    \ The anticipated result is a highly robust photocatalyst with an optimized macroscopic\
    \ form factor that is matched to a prototype reactor system. The technology developed\
    \ in Phase II will be validated for industrial VOC mitigation in the parts per\
    \ trillion range.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been\

    \ Research (SBIR) project includes advancement of the field of white biotechnology,\
    \ which utilizes enzymes to create valuable industrial products. As biological\
    \ molecules, enzymes are more difficult to manipulate than conventional chemicals\
    \ and often need more extensive development before they can be adapted to industrial\
    \ or pharmaceutical manufacturing. This SBIR project will demonstrate how enzymes'\
    \ performance can be improved using stabilization with special synthetic materials\
    \ known as polymers. Enzymes are characterized by precise, unique structure and\
    \ function, which is in turn essential for their role in catalysis of complex\
    \ chemical reactions. Synthetic polymers, on the other hand, despite being less\
    \ precisely structured, can be rationally designed to withstand or respond to\
    \ chemical, thermal or biological conditions. The synergistic fusion of enzymes\
    \ and synthetic polymers results in an advanced enzyme with improved chemical\
    \ properties, leading to new manufacturing processes for valuable products such\
    \ as chemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals; these processes should require\
    \ less energy, utilize fewer hazardous reagents, and generate less waste. \n\n\
    This SBIR  Phase II project proposes to develop a combinatorial synthesis device\
    \ that can feed high-throughput screening of enzyme-polymer conjugates with desired\

    \ set of polymers currently available on the market, it is important to develop\
    \ methods to scale the identification of optimally performing enzyme-polymer conjugates.\
    \ This will be achieved through combination of high-throughput synthesis of enzyme-polymer\
    \ conjugates and high-throughput screening of attained properties. The target\
    \ application of the proposed research is focused on pharmaceutical biocatalysis.\
    \ Application of a high-throughput method will not only result in faster research\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide timely and highly localized climate forecasts, plus information such as extreme heat and frost risk, to insurance, energy, and agricultural stakeholders. Climate forecasting at sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales is challenging, yet essential for proactive risk management of extreme natural hazards.  This project will leverage artificial intelligence and cloud computing to implement a data-intensive approach for revolutionizing global climate forecasting. The project will provide efficient and accurate seasonal forecasts at relatively low computational cost in a user-friendly web environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop a localized, timely, and reliable climate forecasting system that is industry-focused and crop-specific. In this project, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques will be deployed to advance operational climate forecasting skill at a global scale. While conventional forecasts are trained exclusively on observational data, this project will train models on historical simulations and reanalysis, then evaluate them with observations. In this approach, the training dataset is substantially larger, consequently improving accuracy. This processing at scale is enabled with cloud resources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a simple wearable device to manage pain. Despite advances in new therapies, addictive narcotic medications still remain a widely utilized method to control pain for many conditions. The proposed technology represents a new noninvasive approach to blocking nerve conduction without reliance on drugs. The device can be easily adapted to treat any condition wherein pain is transmitted along nerves close to the skin surface. This work will demonstrate feasibility of a novel therapeutic approach to pain management without risk of drug dependence or addiction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fully develop a human wearable thermal nerve block device for treating severe head and neck pain by blocking nerves in the occipital region. Occipital pain is driven by a number of physiological and pathological causes, and many patients fail to find adequate pain relief solutions that allow them to continue their daily activities, thus leading to poor quality of life with reduced productivity and socialization. The device developed in this project will thermally modulate the occipital region in such a way as to initiate and then maintain a drug-free nerve block.

    \ recent study estimated that 50% of all tiny particles that are two and one half\
    \ microns or less in width (PM2.5 particles) in the Western US could be attributed\
    \ to wildfires. With warmer and drier seasons, in places like California, wildfires\
    \ are becoming a year-round risk. Better fire suppression technologies are highly\
    \ desired to counter this increasing environmental threat. Fire hose nozzles are\
    \ the key instrument used by firefighters in the US; However, research improving\
    \ these nozzles is lacking. The nozzles used by firefighters are centuries old\
    \ designs that were not optimized for fire-suppression. The proposed Phase II\
    \ project aims to optimize the nozzles to enable up to two times faster suppression.\
    \ Faster suppression can prevent billions in dollars of property damage each year\
    \ and save lives. The proposed technology has the potential to generate up to\
    \ $50 million in revenue and 40 jobs by 2026.  This SBIR Phase II Project will\
    \ use the fundamentals of thermal management and computational fluid dynamic simulations\
    \ to design fire-hose nozzles that can increase fire-suppression efficiency by\
    \ two times while saving 50% of the water. For rapid design iteration, 3D printing\
    \ techniques will be used to create nozzle prototypes for field testing and conduct\
    \ the design of experiment studies. Traditional fire-fighting nozzles are classified\
    \ as smooth-bore nozzles or combination nozzles. Smooth-bore nozzles create solid\
    \ streams with low coverage. Combination nozzles can generate wide stream patterns\
    \ but have a significantly smaller ranges in wide mode. By optimizing the flow\
    \ pathways, a diverging solid stream pattern will be created. The diverging solid\
    \ stream will combine the long-range and penetration of smooth-bore nozzles and\
    \ wide coverage of combination nozzles in one system. In the Phase I work, fire-suppression\
    \ studies showed that such water stream patterns increase suppression rates by\
    \ three times for vegetation fires while using less than half the water. In the\
    \ proposed Phase II work, the nozzles will be optimized for structural fires.\
    \ Additionally, as part of the Phase II work, an adjustable smooth-bore nozzle\
    \ will be developed. These adjustable nozzles will further increase the suppression\
    \ efficiency and allow the firefighters to adapt to different fire scenarios.\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal is in the development of a new carbon utilization technology with the ability to make high-value, essential products from carbon dioxide (CO2) like cellulosic textiles, food, and building materials. Enzymatic carbon utilization is of high interest due to its ability to make high-value natural products from carbon dioxide. The impediment to enzymatic carbon utilization technology has been the short longevity of both enzymes and input molecules under cell-free industrial conditions. This project will yield a novel enzyme stabilization approach for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes. The resulting system may unlock CO2 as a new, natural resource for essential product supply chains that are carbon-negative and water- and land-neutral, unlocking a $10 trillion global market. This scalable technology could create a new carbon industry and advance manufacturing jobs in the United States. This technology could enable sustainable and domestic production of America’s most essential materials from waste carbon dioxide emissions at a cheaper cost than today’s production.

    This project involves a production method that applies a bio-inspired, non-covalent enzyme stabilization strategy that employs cell-free conversion of carbon emissions into cellulosic fibers for textiles in a CO2-to-textile process over industrially relevant time periods. The proposed stabilization method preserves enzyme conformation without harming baseline activity to allow for enzymatic activity in non-natural environments. The heteropolymers are synthesized using a standard reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization approach to produce disordered polymeric chains with diverse monomers of varying charges and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics to complement and stabilize enzymes surfaces. The disordered nature of the polymers enables local surface binding to stabilize the enzyme, maintaining its conformation and protecting against denaturing or degradation. The project scope covers key technical hurdles: (1) the development of a enzyme stabilization technique for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes, (2) the development of a carbon conversion system and process in a non-natural, industrial environment, and (3) confirmation of a full proof-of-concept solution that can be scalable from mL to 50L scale. If successful, the result is an effective enzyme stabilization method that can fix carbon emissions under cell-free conditions for use in industrial supply chains.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient semiconductor chips dedicated to solving challenges with many possible outcomes and inherent uncertainty. Such problems are encountered in decision-making, risk management, chip design, drug design, business analytics, machine learning, computing failure rates of manufactured products, pricing complex financial derivatives, resource allocation in 5G networks and financial portfolios. Current methods for addressing these problems are intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed chips would quantify the uncertainty and find suitable solutions to many real-world challenges with faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient methods.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on advancing probabilistic computers for probabilistic computing. Decision-making, econometrics, risk management, chip design, and drug development are not deterministic. By leveraging the natural stochasticity of specific devices, it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of devices otherwise used for the same computational tasks. The proposed computational architecture and pipelining enables improved computational speed, power consumption, and chip manufacturing costs. The goals of this project are two-fold. The first is to deliver 10-1000x improvement in computation speed compared to CPUs and GPUs using the emulation of probabilistic computers on Field Programmable Gate Arrays. The same task will make projections about the performance of the actual probabilistic computer. The second is to quantify how well the probabilistic computer can accommodate semiconductor manufacturing process variations. Controlling such variations is a significant factor in semiconductor manufacturing costs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to increase the diversity of people engaging in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) by broadening the creative and expressive possibilities at the intersection of craft and circuit design.  The project hypothesizes that by creating design and digital fabrication tools that leverage familiar paper craft practices and the intrinsic motivational value the arts, circuit design and fabrication can be made accessible to those who are novices to circuit design and fabrication.  Research shows that this approach is especially successful for reaching those who otherwise may not participate in STEM, especially underrepresented minorities, girls and women. By developing software to support digital circuit design and fabrication, this project enables users to easily share and build off of digital design templates, expanding the reach of beginner-friendly starter projects and creating a community of learners who can co-create and co-teach. Further, by enabling creators to connect circuit design to consumer-friendly digital fabrication technologies like desktop craft cutters, we will bring the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditionally technical environments and into entirely new and more mainstream audiences.

    The technical innovation is the development of novel electrical design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing electronics computer aided design tools, making the tool accessible to novice users such as educators, hobbyists and artists.  This will be done through the elimination of schematic abstractions along with powerful simulation capabilities uniquely catered for expressive and artistic technological creations.  By combining beginner-appropriate electronic footprints with a drawing interface for sketching traces, users will be able to represent their designs exactly as they would appear when built.  By incorporating electrical rule checks along with simulation of circuit behavior, the software will allow users to iterate on their designs with confidence before they invest time in fabricating. To address these challenges, the design of the software and accompanying physical toolkit will be designed iteratively and in close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters through a series of user studies to ensure that the intended audience who have never used electronic design software before can manufacture their designs easily while being able to express their diverse interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase aquaculture productivity by reducing disease impact. Disease costs billions in losses each year to the aquaculture industry and threatens the global food supply. The disease caused by White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) can devastate a shrimp farm and costs over $1 billion in losses each year. Farmers are often unaware of a disease issue until animals show advanced signs of disease or there are mortalities. Laboratory diagnosis is expensive and results take days-to-weeks, which is often far too long for results to be actionable. Early warning of white spot disease can enable farmers to take immediate action to reduce losses, reducing costs and increasing industrial robustness.  This project advances a new diagnostic to quickly, easily, and reliably detect WSSV in cultivated shrimp in a new easy-to-use, on-site test.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance translation of a novel diagnostic for WSSV in a technology incorporating engineered proteins with specific targets into a paper-based biosensor. Prior studies demonstrated proof-of-concept with a paper-based immunoassay with polymerization-based amplification for detection of protein-based biomarkers for HRP2–the primary protein biomarker of malaria–with sensitivity as low as 70pM. This project will bioengineer thermostable rcSso7d DNA-binding proteins to bind the WSSV target and incorporate them into the paper testing format. Assay sensitivity, reagent composition, and dynamic range will be explored as part of an effort to understand the biological and functionally meaningful limits of the developed assay. Tasks include a WSSV challenge study to evaluate the sampling parameters and detection limits of the prototype in laboratory cultured shrimp. The resulting prototype will rapidly and selectively bind the WSSV target and yield stable, easily interpretable, colorimetric results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of low-cost, flexible displays allowing smart objects to better communicate with their users. Researchers estimate that in 2017 there were 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that were not computers, estimated to grow to 125 billion by 2025. These Internet of Things devices are already used in many applications for transportation, health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. These devices can enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety; they will require displays that are thin, low power, flexible or curved, and easy to read. A near-term need is autonomous transportation, which will need a method of visual communication between vehicle and rider.  This project will develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays; just this initial transportation application will help improve mobility for the elderly and disabled, traffic safety, and related needs.  In the longer term, this project will enable manufacturing of improved displays with reduced processing waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix (OLED) displays. These displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography, a slow and expensive process. The high-resolution printable anode developed here replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process, laying the foundation for fully roll-to-roll printed displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a reliable, economically viable, and cost-effective domestic supply of cobalt, nickel, and manganese by harvesting critical metals from spent lithium ion batteries. These critical metals are needed in modern infrastructure, transportation and communication. Today, the United States imports 78% of cobalt it consumes annually but recycles only 5% of cobalt-containing lithium-ion batteries. Replacing cobalt with nickel and manganese in these batteries puts supply of those metals at risk. This project proposes a straightforward recovery process to create supply chain stability, more economic activity through recyclers and less landfilling of potentially dangerous lithium ion batteries. The project aims to create standalone processing units that can be added to existing battery processing to create a refined source of these key metals for domestic use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new approach to lithium ion battery recycling by integrating a metal sulfide sorbent technology into a capacitive deionization (CDI) electrochemical system for scalable and efficient recovery of cobalt, nickel, and manganese from spent batteries. CDI is an emerging process for removing charged species from a feed solution using porous electrodes. This work pairs CDI with efficient metal-sulfide sorbents by integrating the sorbent material into the cathodes for efficient recovery of critical metals from black mass leach solution. While CDI has typically involved carbon cathodes, metal sulfide sorbents have been selected for surface doping owing to their remarkable stability, adsorption capacity, and expected amenability to casting. The proposed work will: 1)  demonstrate viable cation uptake from black mass into the sorbent material; 2) construct a capacitive deionization cell with the sorbent material integrated into the cathode for increased recovery; and 3) demonstrate recovery with appropriate selectivity toward cobalt, nickel, and manganese separations from black mass using a novel CDI cell.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the proposed SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications) prototype, designed as a best-in-class pressure, temperature, and seismic sensor system to be incorporated into new global submarine fiber optic cable networks. The expected commercial impacts are significant, as the customer base for SMART technology includes commercial submarine cable suppliers, government monitoring agencies, scientific consortia and agencies, and internet content providers. The development and deployment of SMART will enhance scientific understanding of Earth’s oceans, seafloor, and subsurface via a fundamentally new approach to long-term subsea sensor network deployments. SMART will therefore provide essential new data to reduce disaster risk and improve global climate understanding, thereby reducing societal and environmental vulnerabilities to these long- and short-term threats.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop the first integrated SMART prototype system. This innovative real-time deep ocean monitoring technology will catalyze fundamental improvements in Tsunami Early Warning (TEW), Earthquake Early Warning (EEW), global climate monitoring and telecommunications resiliency.  The innovation is to tightly integrate sensors into the amplifiers (“repeaters”) used to boost signals in the optical fibers. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components will be utilized for nearly all physical elements of the system. The sensor assembly includes a 3-axis accelerometer, absolute pressure gauge, and temperature sensor, integrated with data acquisition circuits with suitable dynamic range and precision, a common communications module, an interface suitable for fiber optic cable spans up to 120 km in length, software and firmware necessary to support the data path, an isolated power source, and precision timing. The SMART repeater design is modular, allowing different sensors, adaptation to different repeater housings, or use as a standalone unit. Technical hurdles to be addressed include hardware development and integration, software development, data acquisition and processing, power management, communications bandwidth, and delivery of precision time and frequency references.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation\
    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help people who suffer from body-focused\
    \ repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). Over 4% of Americans suffer from skin picking,\
    \ hair pulling, and nail biting, the majority of whom resort to covering up the\
    \ problem with makeup, gloves, wigs, and even tattoos due to treatment cost barriers\
    \ and lack of effective tools to facilitate behavior change. While behavior therapy,\
    \ and in particular habit reversal training, has shown efficacy, this method is\
    \ traditionally burdened by unreliable journaling, a lack of access to treatment,\
    \ and difficulty for patients to perform in real-time because of a lack of awareness.\
    \ While real-time awareness devices do exist, there is room for improvement in\
    \ detection accuracy. This project will integrate a novel sensor system into a\
    \ wearable device that can lead to state-of-the-art detection accuracy of BFRB-related\
    \ behaviors.  This wearable sensor solution is the first of its kind, using the\
    \ novel sensor to extract meaningful biomechanical information. \n\nThis Small\
    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in new behavior\
    \ recognition algorithms, a new remote monitoring system, and new data generated\
    \ from in-field experiments. The project will: 1) develop a new sensor calibration\
    \ system and characterize signal artifacts that may influence detection accuracy;\
    \ 2) develop new behavior detection algorithms using data captured in the lab;\
    \ 3) conduct self-guided experiments in the field using the remote monitoring\
    \ system proposed; and 4) refine recognition algorithms. Such sensitive measurements\
    \ require ideal signal integrity, be sufficiently immune to signal artifacts,\
    \ and tight electronics integration within wearable design constraints. This wearable\

    \ cognitive behavioral therapy, the leading method for reducing the negative effect\
    \ of these behaviors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new technology for blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people to use touchscreen devices and explore quantitative data. Currently there are no commercial solutions for the 285 million BVI individuals and their support networks to access text and graphical materials.  The proposed project will advance software that converts graphical and text information into a form for BVI users to explore and utilize. This will enable greater education and work opportunities as well as greater independence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II effort continues development of a novel touchscreen-based information access software offering multisensory representations of both text and graphical information in digital media. Information can be efficiently conveyed with graphical tools such as bar graphs, but BVI users cannot exploit these methods to synthesize data.  This project develops the artificial intelligence (AI) framework to support automatic conversion of visual graphics into multisensory graphics and demonstrates its utility.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of renewable electricity.  Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by 2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account for as much as 85% of total costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at scale.

    The  broader  impact/commercial  potential  of  this  Small  Business  Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the support of newborn and infant health services at the point-of-care (i.e., in pediatrician offices and at home). This project will develop quantitative imagining and machine learning technology that will allow pediatricians to evaluate and monitor the infant’s head development during well-child visits and/or remotely. If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized  clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone. These parameters are commonly used to monitor child development, and in the diagnosis and treatment planning of common conditions with head deformations. In this  project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies. This approach can handle object motion and can be implemented directly on a smartphone/tablet to compute full three-dimensional shape analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a tool that will streamline the clinical trial process, reducing time and money spent without sacrificing safety or an understanding of a treatment’s efficacy. Medical treatments do not work equally well on all patients. Finding a responsive population on which to perform a study directly impacts the likelihood of a new therapy’s success while minimizing risk to patients who would see little or no benefit. The tool will allow clinical trials to be run virtually as computer programs in software that simulates human physiology. This technology will be valuable at all stages of treatment development: suggesting new therapies, testing for adverse effect, planning clinical trials, interpreting trial results, and predicting results when a new therapy is introduced outside of the clinical trial.  This project is focused initially on the development of a critical under-represented population: older black men with hypertension and associated diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Simulations of specific populations will allow researchers and clinicians to anticipate issues, enabling more effective treatment plans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a virtual population of 50-70 year old hypertensive African-American men with and without common cardiovascular comorbidities including congestive heart failure and type II diabetes. The virtual patients will be instantiations of a differential-algebraic model of human physiology, reflecting interactions between factors such as hormone concentrations, electrolytes, and more.  The virtual population will be generated from clinical data collected from other studies and the approach can be used for other specific populations who may be historically under-represented in trials.  This model can be used to estimate responses to clinical interventions (device and pharmaceutical therapies) to inform treatment development and further trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the enabling capabilities in applications that call for both in-air and underwater operations. The aerial-underwater drones are the first drones that can fly in air, swim in water, and transition swiftly between air and water. This project aims to equip the drones with video transmission capabilities through underwater acoustic communication so that the drone need not be tethered to operate underwater. With the enabling capabilities, the drone is useful in critical infrastructure mapping, coastal environment monitoring, emergency response, coastal surveillance, and search and rescue operations.  The underwater video transmission technology can also be applied to other platforms to extend underwater wireless and mobile internet.  The capability, in turn, has the potential to enable Internet of Underwater Things. The commercial potential of the project addresses the pain points of the existing products:  the low data rate and large form factor.  The enhanced drone will enable the hybrid vehicle to create a new market that is unserved by either Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design and prototype a small form factor acoustic communication system for aerial-underwater drones enabling them to achieve high data-rate video transmission over underwater wireless links. The intellectual merits of the proposed acoustic communication system include: 1) real-time hardware implementation of a novel MIMO (multiple-input-multiple-output) transmitter on an embedded GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) such that the system can be powered by battery and be fit in a small water-proof container, 2) real-time hardware implementation of a Turbo equalization receiver on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform to combat the huge Doppler spread and long multipath echoes of acoustic channels, 3) video transmission by a high information data rate of more than 300 kbps over underwater acoustic links, and 4) integration of the small form factor acoustic transmitter with the aerial-underwater drones without interfering with the operation of the drones.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable surgeons to see lymph nodes directly during cancer surgeries to (1) improve the quality-of-care for lung cancer, rectal cancer, and some gynecological cancers; and (2) save costs for hospitals by accelerating a time-consuming and potentially inaccurate step in cancer surgeries; (3) improve hospital accreditation performance, since lymph node number is a quality metric and many hospitals fail to meet the requirements stipulated by medical authorities. Decades of clinical evidence have shown evaluating lymph nodes is linked to higher survival rates for cancer patients. This project will develop a device to be seamlessly integrated into the existing surgical protocols and used as an accessory to existing laparoscopic towers and surgical robots. Any cancer hospital will be able to purchase this device, attach it to their existing towers or surgical robots, and improve their quality of care, surgery efficiency, and accreditation performance immediately at an affordable price.

    The proposed project addresses a difficult and common problem in surgical oncology – finding lymph nodes in cancer surgeries. Lymph nodes are critically important in the context of cancer because they are the channels for cancers to spread. However, lymph nodes are translucent in color and surrounded by fat, also translucent, making it difficult to find them with current optical systems. This project aims to develop a label-free optical imaging device to visualize lymph nodes with high contrast in real time without any injection. The goals of this project are to (1) build an accessory device attachable to a commercially available laparoscopic tower, (2) obtain optical performance testing results from animal carcasses, and (3) obtain optical performance testing results from cadaver specimens.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is related to the use of a patient’s own fat tissue for repair after injury or surgery. Removing tissue to eliminate damage through disease or trauma is universally followed by repairing tissue to restore form and function. While a broad range of materials are available, the use of a patient’s own fat for these procedures has long been considered an obvious option. Fat can be safely harvested, is rich in stem cells and growth factors and has other desirable properties, depending on the location from which it is harvested. The use of this material for surgical procedures has been inhibited by a loss of specific physical properties during the harvesting procedure. Providing a matrix to reconstruct these properties is likely to render fat grafting a more commonplace procedure. By optimizing structure and formulation of this matrix material, tissue engineering can be disrupted with an off-the-shelf option enabling harvested fat from a patient to address the hundreds of thousands of reconstructive procedures undertaken each year.

    The proposed project is based on the use of elastin-based recombinant proteins to address the current limitations of tissue repair scaffolds. The proposed technology uses highly disordered proteins to produce defined 3D structures to replicate mechanical and biological activities of the body. Using iterative design and molecular engineering, the team has generated a new class of biomaterials that are uniquely suited to meet the key criteria for a fat grafting support matrix, including injectability, in vivo phase transition to a firm solid, and biocompatibility to allow cellular viability and vascularization. This project focuses on optimization of the matrix for reconstruction procedures, including facial, breast, amputation sites and foot pad tissues. A range of materials with unique biomechanical properties are likely required to address each of the target use cases.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the loss of fresh produce due to microbial spoilage during its journey from farm to consumer. These food losses amount to $200 billion per year in direct costs worldwide, as well as an increase the environmental footprint of food production systems.  The food spoilage also causes additional potential damage to the environment and human health due to the increased use of synthetic pesticides and preservatives in an effort to prevent loss. This project aims to reduce food spoilage and the unintended consequences by providing safe, effective, and environmentally responsible methods for managing food crops post-harvest.

    The proposed project focuses on the development of controlled release systems to deliver naturally occurring, safe, anti-fungal essential oil compound (EOC) vapors to protect perishable agricultural produce from spoilage. Several experimental systems have been reported in the literature for the controlled release delivery of the EO vapors but no commercialized solutions yet exist. This highlights the importance of focused research and development needed to develop these EO delivery systems. Concurrently with controlled release systems investigations, crucial testing and modeling capabilities both in house and in an external network are also being developed. These include various volatile quantitation techniques ranging from photoionization detectors (PIDs) to gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) instruments, test beds, and dynamic and finite element modeling of transport phenomena.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of animal-free meat alternatives. Today, plant-based meats are consumed mostly by vegans and vegetarians willing to accept higher costs or different tastes compared with meat from animals. Recently, plant-based burgers and sausages have become popular, but the situation is very different for whole-cut meats. Steaks or chicken breasts, for example, have unique textures and tastes that are not yet matched by animal-free alternatives. The proposed project will improve the texture of alternative meats and provide a path to improved nutrition, taste, and aroma.

    The proposed project addresses a limitation of plant-based meats: they lack the distinct fibrous texture found in natural meats. This project advances ultrafine protein fibers with similar structure to animal muscle fibers. Project aims include ultrafine protein fiber production, development of sterile bioreactor systems to house fiber scaffolds for tissue engineering, and feasibility studies of culturing a variety of agriculturally relevant animal cells in the fiber scaffold bioreactors. The first project aim will overcome the technical hurdle of producing edible protein fibers using scalable food-safe processes. The deliverable for Aim 1 will be edible fibrous protein scaffolds with textures approximating meats. Project Aim 2 will evaluate perfusion systems to securely house scaffolds under sterile conditions conducive to cell culture. The deliverable for Aim 2 will be reusable custom tissue culture chambers. Project Aim 3 will compare a selection of animal cells based on their proliferation rates and viability when cultured in our fibrous tissue engineering scaffolds. The deliverable for Aim 3 will be animal cell-based muscle and/or fat tissues.

    This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the productivity, environmental sustainability, and profitability of soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is a major driver of rainforest deforestation, motivating improved yields for environmental sustainability.  In addition, current commercial soybean varieties are highly susceptible to Asian soybean rust, an aggressive fungal disease that is especially severe in tropical and subtropical climates and can decimate soybean yield. This disease is controlled by chemical fungicides that are expensive, pose risks to the environment and human health, and are becoming less effective as the pathogen develops tolerance to over-used chemicals. This project will enable the development of soybean varieties immune to this disease. This will reduce the need for fungicide use in soybean cultivation, reduce yield loss caused by the pathogen, and improve grower profitability. In addition, this technology can be expanded to other crops.

    The proposed project will result in the identification of new plant disease resistance traits with activity against the pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust. The typical plant species has hundreds of immune receptor genes which surveil for the presence of invading pathogens. Plant breeders routinely use plant immune receptor genes to develop new disease-resistant crop varieties. However, traditional methods to identify and translate these traits are time-consuming. The proposed work utilizes a rapid gene discovery platform to accelerate identification of new disease resistance traits. This project will identify and test several resistance traits. The identification and cloning of these resistance gene sequences will allow them to be quickly moved into elite soybean varieties, resulting in significant time and labor savings relative to traditional breeding. These traits can be stacked together to confer durable resistance against a broad range of Asian soybean rust strains.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.

    The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    \ viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first\
    \ time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive\
    \ procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone,\
    \ there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access\
    \ has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in\
    \ pain and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the\
    \ failure rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time\
    \ is $69.76.  Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125\
    \ per IV. When PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly\
    \ central IV access is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections\
    \ as well as other complications. One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20\
    \ additional days of hospital length of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed)\
    \ cost, adding as much as $2.3 billion in increased US intensive care unit costs\
    \ each year.  These failure rates occur even though ultrasound and near infrared\
    \ devices are available to improve first time IV access. \n\nIn phase II, the\

    \ probe, customized for vascular access, and integrate it into a commercially\
    \ viable system to fulfill goals not supported by any other imaging system: finding\

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop the technical functionality of its cohort recruitment tool that will advance efforts to launch a production quality substance abuse disorder (SUD) research platform designed for use by addiction researchers at universities, academic medical centers, and commercial sector where U.S. publicly-funded research on addictions exceeds $1.4 billion per year. The project will enable the company to contribute directly to broader societal goals of reducing the negative effects and costs of substance abuse, addiction, and treatment services to individuals from all sectors of society (e.g., minorities, veterans, etc.) by enabling addiction researchers to surface novel and more effective addiction recovery supports and interventions essential to enhancing health outcomes and controlling health care costs. The enhanced functionality will provide SUD researchers and stakeholders a unique platform to study and leverage existing evidence to improve treatment protocols, policies, and financing to improve addiction recovery outcomes. Developing the product will enable the company to combine its large mobile recovery community with state-of-the-art research tools that provide significant value to addiction researchers and demonstrate effectiveness to public and private health insurers ? two important target customers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will aid researchers in surfacing novel technical interventions and support scientific methods to improve population health outcomes. Although technologies are emerging to help address recovery support, these have not yet met their full potential for addressing the needs of people striving 24/7 to stay sober, the needs of practitioners including SUD researchers intent on supporting their recovery, and the desire for health insurers to incentivize best practices and to improve health and control costs. The research objectives include expanding on its proof-of-concept for a cohort recruitment tool by building, testing, and implementing a production-ready open-source research platform with enhanced features for conducting scientific studies including participant assessment and intervention scheduling, advanced cohort selection and prospective assignment features, automated study management features, a white label comparison app, highly scalable architecture enabling very large studies, flexible data hosting and management capabilities, and secure software update infrastructure. The result will be an extensible, scalable, and open-source software tool for conducting a broad variety of scientifically rigorous behavioral research studies, including clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

- abstractText: "Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) offers tremendous benefit for rapid\
    \ prototyping, mass customization, and low cost fabrication. This creates an untapped\
    \ opportunity to develop the technology further to support low volume industrial\
    \ manufacturing for price sensitive and emerging markets. The ability to source\
    \ locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into\
    \ a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer\
    \ and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping.\
    \ The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial\
    \ objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale\
    \ products represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are\
    \ ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet\
    \ extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on\
    \ extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the\
    \ ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise\
    \ in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet\
    \ 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs\
    \ by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and\
    \ feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics. \n\n\nre:3D intends to leverage\
    \ Phase I research conducted on material requirements for polyethylene terephthalate\
    \ (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available reclaimed plastics worldwide,\
    \ to further optimize the pellet printer to be able to accept reclaimed flake\
    \ as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include developing the ability\
    \ to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean and switch between\
    \ materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake\
    \ into the platform will also be developed with the requisite controls. Once complete,\
    \ the company will pilot the solution in Texas through IC2 as well as in Puerto\
    \ Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain, in conjunction with\
    \ waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science & Research Trust.\
    \ The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2 will be incorporated\
    \ into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan Technological University's\
    \ (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior\
    \ work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source\
    \ firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively\
    \ tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used\
    \ for casting, mold production and load bearing applications. Once the prototype\
    \ design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU and field-tested,\
    \ all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort to scale the\
    \ solution suite to multiple platforms as quickly as possible. The hardware will\
    \ be sold commercially after completing the project as both an integrated 3D printing\
    \ solution and also as independent hardware due to the potential to be applied\
    \ beyond Cartesian 3D printing systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\
    \ mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's\

    \ tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and\
    \ social emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has\
    \ shown that early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is\
    \ critical for success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable,\
    \ underserved social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school,\
    \ including those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each\
    \ of which disproportionately impact children from racial and ethnic minority\
    \ groups. The game being developed by this project empowers educators to provide\
    \ that much needed social emotional learning support for their young students.\
    \ First, it provides an affordable, feasible, and scaleable means for identifying\
    \ the social emotional needs of young students as they transition to formal schooling.\
    \ Second, it enables educators to quickly translate this formative assessment\
    \ data into personalized, digital intervention that can be applied with K1 students\
    \ on a much broader scale than is possible with traditional, in-person services.\
    \ And lastly, because this innovation is game-based and fun, students are more\
    \ likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded instruction. \n\n\
    \nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent Tutoring System\
    \ (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social emotional instruction\
    \ to all students. Within academic domains such as science and mathematics, many\
    \ successful ITS implementations have employed learning models where answers to\
    \ problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented. However,\
    \ traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like social\
    \ emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and what\
    \ the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several significant\
    \ innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but may also\
    \ be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations are\
    \ represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively\
    \ enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more\
    \ student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,\
    \ leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance\
    \ the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition\
    \ to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from\
    \ this SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop a medical device for valve replacement treatment of chronic insufficiency of the veins (CVI). Currently, no definitive treatment option exists to address the underlying cause of the disease, valvular reflux, which leaves millions of patients with chronic venous ulcers, skin thickening, and pain for years to decades. When brought to market, the proposed novel prosthetic valve and delivery system will provide a viable curative therapy superior to current treatment options and mitigating complications associated with existing valve prostheses, such as thrombosis and valve incompetence. The proposed product will curtail substantial health care expenditures associated with CVI, such as wound care, hospitalizations for infections, and associated secondary procedures. Because implantation of this valve does not require the complex or invasive surgical interventions of existing technologies, its use also will avoid expenses associated with open surgical procedures and rehabilitative care. The commercialization of this innovation is expected to benefit CVI patients, while significantly reducing costs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel, reliable, and marketable prosthetic valve and delivery system for the treatment of incompetent veins. In Phase I, a design was created for a device that exceeded laboratory and animal benchmarks. Phase II proposed development improves the design for broader deployment by demonstrating the the valve's ability to minimize thrombosis as well as the capability to be produced at scale. Phase II objectives are to:  1) Develop and produce the next generation valve for in vitro and animal testing; 2) Compare safety of valve designs in an in vitro study; 3) Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the leading design in a chronic animal study; 4) Complete biocompatibility testing on the design to ensure it is appropriate for human testing; and 5) Establish manufacturability of the device. These steps will provide the foundation for future clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in humans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project proposes continued development of a directional microwave ablation (MWA) system. During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicator’s tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.

    As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will be a safe endovascular detoxification device for treatment of numerous acute and chronic pathologies. The proposed device could aid in the treatment of severe autoimmune disease patients and organ transplant patients, and furthermore, would clear up a path for safe use of viral gene therapy in the general population. It has the potential to decrease mortality and reduce the burden on the global healthcare expenditure for the widespread antibody-mediated pathological conditions. There is a societal need for a safe, cost-effective, fast-acting, widely-accessible, and easy-to-use system capable of rapid blood detoxification for treatment of pathological conditions. The markets targeted by the proposed device include the multibillion-dollar autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and viral gene therapy markets, with the largest market opportunity being the global autoimmune disease therapeutics market that is expected to reach $153.3 billion by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development an endovascular blood IgG detoxification platform for rapid elimination of IgG antibodies for treatment of IgG-driven pathological conditions.  Antibody-mediated immune response has been a key factor responsible for numerous acute and chronic pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejections, immune-mediated rejection in viral gene therapy. Currently, therapeutic apheresis and potent systemic immunosuppressives have been the main forms of management for IgG-driven pathologies. However, these forms of treatments are not patient-friendly, and in many cases do more harm than good. The proposed endovascular blood IgG detoxification device could potentially provide safe and rapid elimination of circulating IgGs, eliminating the need for unfavorable or in cases harmful treatments such as therapeutic apheresis or potent systemic immunosuppressives. The device will be comprehensively investigated in an ex vivo venous simulation system, testing its hemocompatibility, IgG-elimination capacity, and the influence of different parameters including rod material, rod diameter, rod length, flow rate, and therapeutic protein concentration. Furthermore, the safety, durability, immune response, and therapeutic efficacy of the device will be investigated in a lethal IgG-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) model in minipigs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis, and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer and other diseases.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted surveillance test.  A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals.  This Phase II project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it will enhance the machine-learning-based matching methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve surgical outcomes for the more than 200,000 newborns worldwide who are born each year with congenital conditions that cause impaired growth of the skull or mandible.  These abnormalities affect breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication.  Current treatments for this fragile population are inherently complex and traumatic. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized treatment modality for craniofacial abnormalities that harnesses the body’s natural ability to regenerate bone in order to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects. While surgeons have shown the utility of DO for restoring functional discrepancies in patients born with craniofacial differences, the technique has not been widely adopted due to limitations of current DO systems, including their semi- buried design and burdensome reliance on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols. This project will further development of a novel distraction technique that will address many of these issues. Beyond the initial DO indication, eventual applications in surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder represent an eventual market potential of at least $6 B.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further development of a novel contactless implant and associated external driver that will significantly improve upon current distraction osteogenesis (DO) surgical apparatus by removing a principal path to device-associated complications and treatment noncompliance.  The current standard of care includes an external component that protrudes through the patient’s skin; this is required for manual expansion of the device. The device package to be developed in this proposal will eliminate the protruding component through use of an innovative design that leverages magnets instead of manual action to produce the force necessary for distraction.  This will not only remove a pathway to infection but also will resolve many of the other limitations associated with the standard of care such as the increased risk of device dislodgement, analgesic use, patient stigma, required manual operation, and treatment noncompliance.   This project will build on early proof-of-concept work to model, produce and then test a set of device prototypes, with critical dimensions no larger than standard of care, to rigorously demonstrate that they can meet key performance specs; in particular that they can provide the distraction force necessary to enable a new and entirely contactless DO procedure.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is an improved treatment for patients suffering from glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting 3.4 million Americans and 80 million people worldwide. The global glaucoma surgery devices market will reach $1.74 billion by 2024, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. In the U.S., glaucoma incurs over $4 billion in medical and societal costs annually. For patients with glaucoma, elevated eye pressure must be lowered to prevent optic nerve damage. However, conventional surgical implant treatments are bulky, highly invasive, and cause chronic discomfort. Newer, smaller devices are less invasive but affect long-term efficacy as they inadequately sustain lower eye pressure when scarring occurs. This project will develop an implant many times thinner than a human hair to safely reduce eye pressure while minimizing patient discomfort and failure from scarring. The device will facilitate patient comfort and surgical ease through a combination of mechanical and materials engineering. Beyond glaucoma, the technology will play a key role in future permanent and efficacious ocular implants - a rapidly growing component of vision care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues development of an ultrathin implant to treat glaucoma. Specifically, this project will optimize a novel corrugated microstructure with a unique combination of mechanical and fluid flow properties. These characteristics provide the implant with stiffness required for handling, flexibility to conform to soft eye tissues, and flow properties for controlling intraocular pressure. Devices will be fabricated using improved micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) methods and validated on a new instrument designed to evaluate flow resistance. This project will conduct biocompatibility, toxicology, and performance studies, monitoring intraocular pressure, levels of inflammation, adverse events, and implant stability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve diagnosis of pediatric otitis media (ear infection).  Otitis media is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children and the second most common pediatric physician appointment.  It is estimated that more than 90% of children will suffer at least one case of otitis media before age 5.  Despite its prevalence, there may be less than 60% diagnostic accuracy in primary care where the vast majority of cases are seen.  Current clinical diagnostics have proven inadequate to address over-prescription of antibiotics and unnecessary specialist and surgical referrals. Otitis media is typically diagnosed using an otoscope to view the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and assess visual signs of an infection.  Otoscope designs have changed little since the 1800’s.  This SBIR Phase II project advances a novel device that integrates clinical standard otoscopy with a novel technique to non-invasively assess ear health using light in real time and with 98% accuracy.  This new otoscope has the potential to create a new standard of care in diagnosis and management of otitis media, and stands to save billions in direct healthcare costs through more accurate diagnosis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a device providing clinicians with an objective, real-time indicator of ear health during standard otoscopy.  At the push of a button, the LED driven measurement will provide an instantaneous, accurate indication of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE) – the most sensitive and specific indicator of acute otitis media per established clinical guidelines.  This project will meet the desired technical specifications of sufficiently sensitive visualization capabilities and reducing measurement time from 1.4 seconds to less than 300 milliseconds.  This project will also: 1) Optimize manufacturability and assembly; 2) Develop a standard automated calibration system; and 3) Conduct standard electronic, photobiologic, and biocompatibility testing for safety and regulatory purposes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid, inexpensive, and ultra-high throughput test to screen patients for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions.  The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing.  Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified.  The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new therapy for bacterial infections,\
    \ especially those resistant to current antibiotics, which have generated antibiotic-resistant\
    \ “super-bug” bacterial infections that cannot be treated easily. Bacteriophages\
    \ (‘phages’) are viruses that only infect specific bacteria and cannot infect\
    \ humans. Phages kill harmful bacteria, but they currently do not work well as\
    \ general solutions that can be prescribed broadly because each phage only kills\
    \ a subset of bacteria; therefore a unique phage may be required for different\
    \ people with the same infection. This project develops new technology to understand\

    \ of each phage responsible for killing specific bacteria, in order to make phages\
    \ for broad use in treating infections. This innovation is a key competitive advantage,\

    \ \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop\

    \ and proprietary high throughput phage characterization methods to generate maps\
    \ of phage-host interactions to identify genes that determine phage host range,\
    \ and use novel engineering techniques to validate these genetic determinants\
    \ of host range. The expected outputs are twofold: 1) a machine learning model\

    \ range and 2) an engineered phage with expanded host range. This work will further\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new optical imaging techniques for evaluating the health of skin, teeth and gums. Optical imaging uses light instead of X-rays to produce detailed images of tissues. It has not yet been widely applied for dental and dermatology applications because the light does not penetrate deeply enough into tissues to be useful, and these devices are prohibitively expensive to manufacture. This project will develop a a new imaging scheme that allows deeper penetration into tissues, providing more useful diagnostic information; and with current 3D manufacturing techniques, it could cost roughly ten times less than the current alternatives. This technology will enable new safe, affordable imaging processes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances translation of a novel optical technique, dual axis deep imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT), for clinical imaging of skin and teeth. Translation of OCT is advanced for retinal imaging but has not enjoyed the same success in other applications.  This project will create new instruments for dentistry and dermatology by demonstrating: 1) how dual axis OCT can penetrate more deeply in biological tissues using instruments designed for each application; and 2) the economic feasibility using 3D manufacturing and system design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to identify potential therapies for a multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Newly diagnosed MM is typically sensitive to a variety of therapies, but relapse is common in later stages.  Personalized analysis would improve treatment decisions.  This project will develop new testing for personalized medicine. Although the initial target is MM, this can potentially be applied to other cancers or diseases.  Personalized medicine can lead to reduced healthcare costs, optimized drug development, and improved patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help develop methods and techniques that will be used to offer new tests for guiding the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The test relies on resolving changes of cancer cells collected from patients upon exposure to various drug options by measuring the mass of individual cells. Today MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the world. Unfortunately, today there are no biomarkers to define therapeutic susceptibility of MM patients to identify a personalized treatment regimen. This project aims to address this problem by developing a high-throughput single-cell mass measurement platform based on suspended microchannel resonators (SMR) to resolve the effects of the drugs on the cancer cells. In this project a new generation of SMR chips with linked single-cell imaging, image processing and cell classification will be developed to analyze a 20-drug panel in three hours.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate development of immunotherapeutics and make them broadly available and affordable to patients in need. Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact.  Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value).

    The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seek to improve the quality of life for manufacturing workers, help U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improve the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells may reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The developed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants perform the low-level tedious tasks. Moreover, this technology enables the human operator to guide the team operation. This ability will improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. performing composite fabrication. Most of these companies face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn. These challenges lead to longer delivery times. This project may  enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, the technology may enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing the reliance on human labor and easily scaling production capacity with the change in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robotic sanding solution for high-mix applications by providing safety under uncertainty during robotic sanding and reducing cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient trajectories by the robot. This award will make computational advances to enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description.  The project will also enable the computational algorithms to account for the uncertainties present in the environment, making robots useful for sanding operations in high-mix applications. A robotic sanding cell for handling large parts in high-mix applications will be developed by selecting the appropriate sensors and tools. Algorithms will be developed for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell while the workpiece is secured with a cost-effective, general-purpose, low-cost fixture. Algorithms will be developed to determine the minimum number of setups needed for sanding large parts in the robotic cell and to generate robot trajectories to produce tool motion patterns that ensure efficient and safe sanding operation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use artificial intelligence methods to help all PhD program stakeholders (students, alumni, faculty, administrators) maximize desired student placements by leveraging available courses and other resources on campus. PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve satellite-based agricultural imaging to allow monitoring and managing of broad regions for enhanced sustainability and food security.  The proposed algorithms address noise in satellite data that is caused by the atmosphere.  The method can be used for many types of satellites, providing advantages in efforts to reduce weight and space to control launch cost.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address a major issue in modern remote sensing, atmospherically induced noise in the data. EOS systems look through the atmosphere that distorts spectral relationships of reflectance (ratio of EOS-measured reflected light to the sunlight that would be received were there no atmosphere). The variable atmosphere distorts the data variably so must be corrected to accurately interpret highly useful measures such as agricultural production/yield, photosynthesis, plant water use, plant disease/insect infestations, etc., rendering EOS data unreliable unless corrected. The technical tasks are to: (1) study European Space Agency Sentinel 2 EOS data, (2) migrate the method to NASA/USGS Landsat 8, (3) adapt the method for calibration of the several decades-long Landsat Multispectral Scanner record that cannot otherwise be corrected to surface reflectance, (4) develop a calibration tool for multiple commercial EOS, and (5) develop a fully integrated software system.

    \ plant is an average energy savings of $200 k per year, with less than 6 months\
    \ payback, and lower operating costs while reducing/preventing out-of-control\
    \ effluent events.  Competing technologies for real-time nitrogen sensors are\

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the research and development of an intelligent, immersive, virtual reality (VR) platform for remote physical therapy and patient monitoring. This innovation enhances biomechanical analysis to facilitate telerehabilitation through off-the-shelf consumer VR head-mounted displays in patient homes and clinics, effectively providing a means for in-patient success metrics and full-body exercise guidance using a centralized, remote virtual platform. Such technology may have the ability to enable greater affordability, accessibility, and accuracy of physical therapy for patients and therapists alike. Patient throughput could potentially be doubled through remote visits in virtual environments and automated physical health documentation. In addition, the platform will be designed to support therapists working in marginalized communities of "medical deserts," where patients are uninsured and care is significantly limited by hospital capacity, physical distance, doctors per population, and cost. This software-as-a-service immersive physical therapy platform may reach a projected annual revenue of $2.08M USD. With remote tools and predictive physical therapy analytics, more individuals will receive access to treatment regardless of their socio-economic and demographic background.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an immersive virtual reality environment where therapists can meet their patient in a 3D virtual clinic and use the platform's tools to aid in patient evaluation. This technology addresses the shortcomings of widely used current telehealth platforms (most often videoconferencing) where therapists find it difficult to perform common evaluations such as movement abilities and balance coordination tests.  The goal of this project is to build an updated machine learning algorithm with integration on the virtual platform to enable therapists to remotely evaluate their patients with high accuracy biomechanical metrics.  The goal is to achieve remote rehabilitation of patients that is comparable to that of in-person patient rehabilitation. In addition, pilot research will be performed with healthcare organizations to assess this technology in providing patient success metrics and exercise interaction through commercial head-mounted display virtual reality systems. This technology has the potential to positively change a consumer's physical therapy experience by significantly reducing traditional clinical and insurance costs, enabling remote access for populations of low-socioeconomic backgrounds, alleviating discomfort for patients, and increasing remote recovery insights.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is addressing the growing societal need for indoor air purification, as indoor air quality (IAQ) directly affects human health, productivity, cognitive function, and quality-of-life. Awareness of the long-term consequences of poor IAQ has recently witnessed an increase due to research results, improvements in monitoring and sensing technology, public awareness campaigns by organizations such as the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, and Environmental Protection Agency, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding sustainable, economical, and effective solutions to the problem of poor IAQ will greatly benefit public health and wellbeing and will help curtail the spread of pathogens, minimizing the need for social distancing.  This project will develop a new system air purification, addressing viruses, harmful chemicals, odors, and ultrafine particulates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to scale up the production methodology and coating process of novel catalytic materials. The materials are 3D nanostructured porous powders that are designed at multiple length scales to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and longevity, while reducing costs and utilizing raw materials in an environmentally responsible manner. The system uses a synthetic approach based on self-organization of nanoscale building blocks and wet chemistry tools in order to assemble finely structured coatings for integration in air-purification units. This project focuses on expanding it to production scale, wherein achieving control over the composition, structure, porosity, and placement of nanoparticles on a production scale is challenging.  The materials platform development will include adaptation to high-throughput instrumentation and scale-up of the material production and coating process to pilot production. In the process, this project will develop tools and guidelines for manufacturing hierarchically-structured functional materials more generally.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project will address the provision of safe water to our global population.  In high income nations, high-quality drinking water is provided through centralized water-treatment/distribution systems.  For 2-3 billion people in lower income countries, clean drinking water is not a guarantee.  They must collect and store household water, often in open containers without disinfectant.  The consequences of these deficiencies include the consumption of unsafe water that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality from water-related diseases.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that one possible solution to this problem is to decentralize water treatment so that people treat their water right before they consume it in their homes (e.g. point-of-use water treatment).  However, designing point-of-use water treatment technologies is a challenging problem that requires the product to be technologically effective, simple to use, inexpensive, and socially acceptable.  This project will develop a disruptive technology for point-of-use water treatment and will meet these rigorous design criteria.  The technology has the potential to improve water quality, human health, and quality of life for millions of people around the world while employing US citizens for manufacturing and sales of the product.

    This project seeks to develop and test methods to apply metallic copper and an N-halamine coating to the surface of a porous ceramic tablet for household water purification in lower income countries.  The resulting tablet will effectively disinfect viruses, bacteria, and protozoa in 10-20 liters of stored household water for one year (over 7000 liters total) with a cost of less than 0.3 cents per liter.  Copper salt solution will be reduced through high-temperature heating to form microscopic clusters of metallic copper.  When added to water, the copper will oxidize to release copper ions into solution to cause pathogen disinfection. This component will be combined with an existing technology that releases silver ions from a porous ceramic tablet.  The synergistic effects of these disinfectants may enable 1-3-star certification from the World Health Organization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to broaden access to healthcare data. Users of the system developed in this project can take biometric measurements such as heart rate, muscle-activity, and body mass calculations in real-time, with data collected through sensors embedded into clothing.  The innovation enables vital measurements to be taken, both inside and outside of clinical environments, while reducing instrumentation weight and cost requirements. This fabric-based technology can potentially serve users ranging from medical professionals to everyday consumers who will more easily adopt wearable soft-material products in lieu of traditional hardware devices. Specialized sectors such as physical therapy, pre-surgical studies, sports labs, and out-patient care have the highest growth opportunity for new technology adoption. Complementing the rapid growth of telehealth, bio-sensing capabilities for real-time and remote tracking will improve patient compliance and aid health care workers by providing better access to comprehensive vital measurement data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves material science research in conductive threads and fabrics. These soft goods can bend, stretch, and compress along the body where they are worn. In addition, their electromechanical characteristics allow them to pick up small voltage and current signals that are naturally generated from the body, specifically from the heart, muscles, and the brain. By strategically weaving these materials within a shirt, small voltages for EKG (heart), EMG (muscle), EEG (brain), and BIA (water and body mass content) can be simultaneously captured and measured for heart rate, muscle activity, brain activity, and water and fat content measurements. The technical research will involve innovation in fabric-materials optimized for small signal and low noise pickup and design of a comfortable garment incorporating multiple fabric-based electrodes for simultaneous pickup of EKG/EMG/BIA signals. The project will also develop new signal processing algorithms to transform raw voltages to real-time signals transmitted wirelessly. The desired technical result is a functional and wearable prototype with end-to-end communication from the fabric through the garment to a receiving mobile or desktop app visualizing the processed data for heart rate, muscle activity, and body mass analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred 'significant' pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas delivery services. Such events can have severe consequences for a utility including bankruptcy, billions of dollars in liabilities, civil/criminal penalties and higher insurance premiums. This proposed scalable and economical capability to proactively identify potential issues prior to catastrophic failure will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures without requiring additional infrastructure. The project will also help prevent unauthorized third-party activity near pipelines, a leading cause of accidents. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grids, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, temperature, and network characteristics. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur for various reasons, such as sulphur or ice buildup, regulator malfunction, corrosion/aging of hardware, and human error. Such failures are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. Early detection of such signatures with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more) allows corrective action that will avoid loss of life, property damage and service disruption. This project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from real-time pipeline data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties unique to network-level gas-pressure time series. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into failure type, allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations. The project will also develop scalable automated high-dimensional classification models to detect construction activity from satellite and other image data, to initiate preventive action.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to save significant amounts of water at power plants and other industrial facilities, potentially saving hundreds of billions of gallons of water every year in the US. This will help reduce the water footprint of power generation and other cooling applications, reduce operating expenses for these facilities, and increase the reliability of power generation. The annual savings can be several millions of dollars per facility and the market opportunity in the US is estimated at around $4 B. Furthermore, this technology can be used for upcycling the captured water from cooling towers that use wastewater or seawater, potentially producing pure distilled water for commercial and domestic use.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance a water capture technology for cooling tower plumes. The proposed technology uses electric fields to ionize the air around a cooling tower outlet, charge the water escaping cooling towers, and direct it toward a mesh-based collector and ultimately a collection tank on the periphery of the cooling tower. The Phase II proposal includes both systematic experimental studies to optimize the collection setup for real-world deployment, as well as material choice and durability studies. This project will optimize the design and build a pilot system, including a control panel designed for compatibility with existing systems.  Data collected from the pilot installation on collection efficiency, water quality, and power consumption will be used to iterate and improve the design.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a high-throughput biofabrication platform that can create physiologically relevant in vitro tissue models for diverse applications including drug testing, assay development, therapeutics, and biomedical research. The current drug development process is lengthy, inefficient, and expensive. It costs about $1.8 billion and takes 12-15 years to launch a single drug. Approximately 92% of the drugs that passed preclinical testing failed in subsequent human trials, highlighting the lack of adequate preclinical testing tools to generate predictive data. Failure to detect the drug-induced toxicity to the vital human organs in clinical trials often leads to market withdrawal of the drug after launch, which causes enormous financial losses to the drug manufacturer and also negative physical and mental effects for patients. The proposed technology will significantly improve drug safety, increase the efficiency and lower the cost of drug development by providing more reliable and clinically relevant drug testing results in a high-throughput fashion. This technology can also provide patient-specific tissues for critical biomedical research (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo therapeutic applications, providing a viable solution to diseases without no cures or effective treatment yet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-throughput biofabrication platform that is compatible with the high-throughput screening (HTS) systems widely used for drug screening and assay development. Currently, the key bottleneck for traditional microfabrication strategies and mainstream nozzle-based bioprinters is the lack of scalability and throughput to accommodate scalable manufacturing necessary in HTS systems. With the growing adoption of 3D biomimetic human tissue models in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a critical need for advanced manufacturing systems that enable rapid and streamlined tissue fabrication methods that are compatible with already established HTS platforms for preclinical toxicity testing of potential drug candidates. The proposed project will develop a parallel optical projection-based 3D bioprinting platform for direct manufacturing of 3D tissues within multiwell plates commonly used in the HTS systems. Implementation of the proposed 3D bioprinting system will permit subsequent in situ drug screening or assay testing directly within the wells and drastically improve biofabrication workflow efficiencies for the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research community. This bioprinter will serve as a powerful instrument for the mass production of 3D tissue models at the industrial scale to advance drug discovery and assay development.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the resiliency of the supply chain by implementing flexible robotic systems for materials handling.  The robotic systems that are controlled by artificial intelligence. E-commerce sales are increasing 20% year over year. During the COVID-19 pandemic additional retail volume shifted online and many customers became accustomed to sourcing essentials using e-commerce. This shift has put a greater burden on asupply chain infrastructure that has traditionally relied on human labor to pick, sort, pack, and process items for delivery. These manual processes are monotonous, error-prone, and sometimes dangerous, have extremely high worker turnover. The automation of these processes elevates worker roles and brings greater consistency to the processes. The innovation developed during this Phase II project may enable broader automation of complex materials handling processes by creating novel training systems for artificial intelligence-enabled robotic systems that are configured specifically for individual customer needs. This innovation may increase US supply chain resilience, enabling citizens to rapidly and reliably obtain necessities such as food, medicine, and health supplies without needing to leave their homes. The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide domestic production of renewable, biomass-based alternatives to products currently made from oil.  This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the commercial potential of producing 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), a key chemical used to manufacture coatings, adhesives, and plastics, from agricultural wastes like corn cobs. Biomass-based chemicals can decrease the nation's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing cost-competitive high-performance chemical products. Creating high-value commodity chemicals using nonfood agricultural materials as feedstock promises to create new markets for bio-based waste products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will generate the necessary experimental data to design commercial reactors for producing renewable bio-based 1,5-pentanediol. A chemical pathway to produce bio-based 1,5-pentanediol has been demonstrated in laboratory reactors using commercially relevant reactors and catalysts.  In this work a wide range of reactor operating conditions will be explored in the laboratory for scale-up of the process. These operating conditions will be further demonstrated in larger pilot-scale equipment to inform design at commercial scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of life for people who suffer from debilitating forms of paralysis by restoring their lost functionality. There are 5.4 million people in the United States who suffer from paralysis. Not only do these patients suffer from the physical pain that comes with their condition but also, they are afflicted by financial and psychological burdens. The prostheses that are being used today are either passive and affordable or active and unaffordable for the majority of these patients. Active prostheses represent the forefront of brain-computer interfaces development. Current protheses suffer from drawbacks such as constant patient training, the necessity for bulky skin electrodes, variability in electrode positioning, and limited efficacy when worn and operated by the patients themselves. This device first targets incomplete paralysis by functioning as a neural relay station that bridges the disconnect between the healthy neural section above and below the site of injury.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the limitations of current brain-computer interfaces to not only restore functionality in people with paralysis, but to recreate a real-time, seamless experience for them. Most available neural probes rely on highly invasive, sharp shanks to penetrate neural tissue.  These probes cause considerable inflammation, ultimately leading to device failure. Current devices detect signals extracellularly which leads to a  low signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction very challenging. This project will improve brain-computer interfaces by introducing nanoarchitecture to the sensing electrode in order to achieve intracellular sensing. This sensing dramatically increases the signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction considerably simpler. This device is based on an active pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor architecture which will turn neural signals into a string of ones and zeros making signal extraction considerably simpler. This process will minimize the patient-interface training time. This project will fabricate three-dimensional, nano-architected sensing electrodes with high-aspect ratio and high-density nanoneedles, mimicking the natural neural cell environment. The nanoneedles spontaneously penetrate neurons, achieve superior intracellular recording, and reduce chronic inflammation to promote device longevity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help total knee replacement patients who have a joint infection.  Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of a total joint replacement. Beyond immediate treatment, infections can develop years later from unrelated injuries, increasing PJI incidence as older patients opt for replacement joints. Roughly 15.6 million people in the US currently use a replacement joint, and without improved treatment, PJI will represent an estimated $2.2 billion annual US healthcare burden by 2023.  The current standard of care treatment cannot generate sufficiently high antibiotic concentrations within the joint over enough time to eradicate bacterial biofilms on the implant and tissue, the known cause of persistent infection.  This project will advance a proprietary implantable drug delivery system to easily generate and maintain an antibiotic concentration in the joint sufficient to eradicate biofilm and resolve an infection with less surgical trauma, easier patient recovery and lower healthcare cost than the current standard of care provides.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a novel implantable drug delivery system with an externally worn controller that communicates through skin to a simple implant comprising a pump and reservoir.  When therapy is complete the pump can be left in place with no requirement to remove it, avoiding additional surgery common with current implantable pump technology.   This project advances the development of the implant and controller to generate prototypes for thorough testing, including efficacy evaluation for biofilm eradication within a simulated environment.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is ultimately to increase the representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) employment areas, enabling the US to meet the increasing demand for STEM workers and maintain competitiveness in the global innovation community. Factors promoting underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM often take effect early in education and extend beyond traditional classrooms settings; this solution specifically addresses the support needed by parents in order to facilitate STEM informal learning in a way that is particularly engaging for their young daughters. This proposed project, based on evidence-based research in learning in informal environments, will deliver monthly personalized informal learning plans to enable parents to catalyze positive STEM experiences for girls early in their learning journeys so that they are more likely to embrace STEM careers and better positioned to secure them in the future.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform the way young girls perceive and engage in STEM career exploration by providing a progressive playlist of STEM informal learning experiences personalized to their unique interests. This is accomplished through a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven recommender system that learns from user preferences and attributes to recommend content and learning experiences, which are meant to increase STEM confidence and interest for young girls as well as inspire their curiosity. Parents can opt to provide immediate feedback on the recommended plan that further tunes the plan to their child’s needs or swap selections with secondary recommendations. The proposed project’s objectives are to develop and test algorithmic model for sequenced recommendations, design and build the prototype application, and conduct research to determine that personalized recommendation sequences deepen and/or expand STEM knowledge and interests. To guide the development, efficacy of the recommender will be assessed by comparing results from conducting studies using human recommendations with results using the AI recommender. Once the algorithmic model is established, pre and post assessments will be conducted to assess impact of the intervention on engagement and curiosity with STEM, thereby contributing to an increase in knowledge in the field as well as a commercially applicable and timely marketplace product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project will be to empower and educate caregivers to make scientifically guided decisions that enable safer and optimally nurturing sleep environments for infants.  Every year more than 130 million babies are born and over 4 million of those are born in the U.S.  Due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 300 babies every month may not live to see their first birthday.  SIDS remains the leading cause of death for babies aged one month to one year.  Infant mortality rates in the U.S. are higher than in the 20 wealthiest nations.  Innogized Technologies has developed a transformative Internet of Things technology (IoT) that combines hardware and analytics to enable caregivers to make better sleep-time decisions, avoiding overheating, a known stressor for SIDS.  The technology guides caregivers to deliver optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth for their infants anywhere and anytime, while at the same time relieving anxiety.  This technology is poised to immediately capture a sizable portion of the rapidly growing $1 billion US baby monitoring solutions market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a novel consumer product that works  with caregivers to proactively mitigate the risk of under/overheating events in newborns. Sleep-time clothing choices are thermodynamically matched with environmental conditions to create baby-specific safe sleep environments.  The temperatures are  maintained by leveraging the inherent connectivity of the IoT platform. The technology integrates thermal resistance measurements, thermal models and maps, advanced algorithms, and predictive monitoring.  The research objectives of the project tackle the most important remaining technical challenges driving towards successful commercialization and adoption of a product that is essentially an intelligent system, capable of understanding context and tracking and managing complex interactions while anticipating requirements.  The technical product of this research will advance caregiver knowledge and increase understanding of the applied thermodynamics leading to the advantageous state of thermoneutrality as well as increase infant wellbeing.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop low-cost, biodegradable biopolymers to replace non-degradable, single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.  Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.

    The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability of a novel reactive extrusion technology, capable of producing biodegradable and compostable thermoplastics with lignin contents of at least 50 weight percent, using solvent-free reactive processing. The polymer alloys will have mechanical properties comparable to commodity polymers, such as low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and thermophilic composting conditions in under 6 months. These materials will be validated for commercial scale production using twin-screw extruders, converted to raw material feedstocks used in plastics manufacturing including filament, pellets, and sheet, and then converted with standard equipment into products such as containers for agriculture, floral, and forestry plant production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make it possible for astrophysicists to dramatically expand their ability to collect the spectra of distant galaxies, and so to advance their understanding of the universe. The most important factor in large-scale spectrographic data collection is the number of spectra taken per viewing hour. The planned Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) is mechanically simpler than the current state-of-the-art positioning systems; it will cost less to produce per installed fiber, and it will provide more fibers per unit area than any existing design. The spectra of galaxies is critical to dark energy and dark matter research programs, and these programs address the greatest open questions in astrophysics today. The relative simplicity of the DFPS mechanical components makes it a better choice for spectrographs of tens of thousands of fibers, but also for much smaller arrays of a few hundred fibers, such as could be installed on smaller telescopes. Thus, the DFPS will win a share of the small market for very large spectrographic instruments, but also to create for itself a large market for smaller spectrographic instruments.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a small Direct Fiber Positioning System (DFPS) consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 fibers on a 5-mm grid. Each fiber will provide a 3.6-mm x 3.6-mm range of motion and will be controlled by electronic circuits consuming less than 20 mW. A calibrated camera will view the illuminated fiber tips, monitoring their position with an accuracy of 10 µm, to measure and demonstrate the precision and repeatability of the fiber positioner. The stability of the positioner will be determined over the course an hour in warm and cold environments, and in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The direct method of fiber movement requires accurate control of voltages applied to many fibers in parallel, which is a challenging electrical engineering problem that has been avoided by other, mechanically complex systems. If we can locate fibers with an accuracy of 10 µm in the focal plane of a telescope, we will be able to provide a new and superior type of fiber-positioner, one that will be more compact, less vulnerable to mechanical failure, less susceptible to corrosion, and more resistant to fatigue than any other existing fiber-positioning system.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to apply low-cost radiofrequency (RF) sensing hardware to detect, monitor, and localize transmitters in industrial and urban environments. This technology can solve key problems in manufacturing and logistics operations such as finding RF transmitters that are interfering with operations or monitoring the health of radio systems. These activities are required in modern industrial environments as increasing numbers of critical systems rely on radio communications to operate. In urban environments, automating the tasks of detecting, monitoring, and localizing transmitters can simplify the management of large-scale radio networks and gather critical data on wireless device usage. Increased instances of intentional jamming and the rollout of new communications standards such as 5G make these tasks critical to the modern city. Traditionally, such monitoring tasks are conducted manually with expensive spectrum monitoring equipment. Automated installations also utilize expensive sensors, making automated spectrum monitoring only feasible in safety-critical areas such as around airports. Lower-cost sensors can be installed permanently at a high density for almost any application, allowing cities and smaller industrial customers to deploy persistent monitoring networks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy high-density networks of low-cost sensors, determine the efficacy of existing detection and localization algorithms as applied to the network, and evaluate novel machine-learning (ML) algorithms for similar tasks. This project will also mitigate the technical risk of deploying such a system by characterizing how well commodity software-defined radio (SDR) hardware can perform across a variety of operational environments. No high-density and large-scale test networks of inexpensive radio hardware have been deployed for the purposes of industrial and urban spectrum monitoring, so data gathered throughout this SBIR Phase I project will be useful in evaluating the viability of this approach. By evaluating ML algorithms for signal detection and localization, this project can help determine how effective machine learning models can be at ingesting RF data from low-cost sensors and synthesizing actionable outputs about the radio environment. The result of this project will be an analysis of the detection and localization performance of a variety of algorithms across different environments and sensor node densities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the acceleration and improvement of battery manufacturing and production. Forecasting battery safety and lifetime is largely an unsolved problem in the battery industry. For manufacturers, this uncertainty increases cell cost through control measures during production as well as the precautions taken to avoid warranty events. This project proposes "data science-as-a-service" for battery formation to address both issues. By streamlining the battery formation, test, and grading process, manufacturers benefit from reduced work-in-progress (WIP) inventory waiting for final inspection, reducing facility space requirement to store WIP cell, and reducing scrap rates and increasing manufacturing yields.  The impact of these improvements will potentially enable wider spread adoption of electric vehicle applications, a major driver for battery demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing information technology infrastructure and algorithms for the prediction of battery performance during cell production. By combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with data management and manufacturing execution systems, battery cell manufacturers will greatly reduce the cost to operate and manage cell formation and test - an environment which has been largely underserved for innovation. The proposed project objectives will be achieved through two developing battery classification and prediction machine learning algorithms to improve early detection of battery failures.  Novel implementation of the proof-of-concept algorithms in battery production environments will improve the key performance indicators of these battery manufacturers.  Regression and clustering models will be used as often as possible, and the bulk of the technical work will be dedicated to the feature engineering required to elucidate changes in the change and discharge voltage profile during the first few cycles. New features will be developed by a) modelling physical processes (e.g. growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer) expected for a given cluster group or b) employing dynamical systems techniques like time-delay embeddings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide economic benefits to farmers and consumers as well as broader societal benefits in the U.S. and globally for many different farm operations (e.g., vegetable, flower, and herb growers as well as greenhouse operations) and farm customers.  Higher farm productivity directly benefits society by expanding the availability of nutritious, affordable food. Vegetables are vital U.S. crops in terms of food sources and farm profitability.  One of the main challenges for vegetable farmers that limits productivity and total yield is the need to grow starter plants for the vegetables in greenhouses (or to purchase them) and then transplant them into tilled soil, which is highly labor-intensive and expensive.  This system replaces that process with a system that plants pre-germinated seeds directly into the field with precision at a projected cost of 26% of the incumbent methods.  The technology is an all-electric system that reduces the use of fossil fuels used in planting 100% and is 75% lighter weight than incumbent transplanting solutions using diesel tractors. The technology also addresses the increasing scarcity of farm labor with an autonomous planting system using automatic guidance and machine learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to solve the problem of separating pre-germinated seeds in a batch of thixotropic gel such that one and only one pre-germinated seed is planted at each desired location in real-time under actual field planting conditions.  Plant scientists have proven in numerous scientific studies that planting pre-germinated seeds increases production and lowers costs.  Reliable field planters have not been successful, however. The primary research objective is to prove that an autonomous seed-singulation system combining flow controls, seed detection, active machine learning, singulation, and extrusion in real-time can meet the requirements of the field to prove commercial viability.  The project research will begin by using discrete event simulation to model the singulation process used to obtain optimal parameters for the system. The model’s output will be used to develop control algorithms and programs.  A prototype autonomous system will be developed to test the algorithms in actual field conditions. The anticipated result of this research is that the system can reliably plant one and only one seed at each desired location at least 90% of the time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is enabling increased throughput and quality in semiconductor, chemical and biochemical manufacturing. The ability to monitor pressure from atmosphere to ultra-high vacuum is a critical need for these industries. This need is currently addressed by using combinations of vacuum monitoring technologies that, in many cases, require the high cost of employing multiple devices for a single job, allowing for multiple failure modes, and increasing the space constraints on the manufacturing equipment.  Errors in accuracy in current systems can lead to lower production yields and failures due to exposure of fragile elements to atmospheric pressure can lead to higher maintenance costs and lower process availability. In this context, this new technology offers a substantial commercial benefit across several large-scale manufacturing industries.  This technology will be further leveraged for other large-scale verticals such as mass spectrometry and radiation detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will exploit ultrasensitive ion-sensing properties of low-power graphene sensors combined with voltage-controlled ion sources and resetting mechanisms for vacuum sensing. The core scientific breakthrough that underpins this technology is an ultrahigh intrinsic charge-to-current amplification mechanism inherently present in the graphene sensors.  This results in measurable changes in electrical conductance caused by the attachment of trace quantities of ions on the sensors. The nonlinear nature of the charge-to-current amplification scales to higher values at lower ion-flux rates, thereby allowing greater effective sensitivity at lower pressures.  In addition, combining these sensors with voltage-tunable ion sources and appropriate resetting mechanisms enables stable, long-term operation over a wide range of operating vacuum pressure.  Manufacturing sensors at the chip scale allows for multi-sensor readout for improved signal and reproducible behavior, along with resilience against failure. Taken together, these technological innovations will allow the development of high-performance vacuum gauges for diverse applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help enable the expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) through new peel-and-stick sensor nodes.  Such IoT nodes require low device cost, and thus low sub-component costs for sensing elements, processing circuits, communications, and power. In addition, they are power constrained, requiring minimal energy consumption during sensor data collection, processing, and transmission. Integrating low-cost and low-power components into a single size-limited device becomes a substantial challenge using conventional semiconductor fabrication materials and processes. This SBIR Phase II project will use a novel System-on-Foil approach that patterns efficient silicon circuitry directly into a novel flexible silicon substrate, alongside low-cost printed electronics. This approach enables the integration of all core IoT elements, including microprocessors, sensors, antennas, interconnects, and power supplies, making robust systems with applications in condition monitoring for civil infrastructure, human health monitoring, automotive, grid battery management, wind turbines, aerospace, and industrial equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel semiconductor recrystallization technology to support a new generation of flexible electronics. To include on-board processing, communication, and memory circuitry, current state-of-the-art flexible electronics rely on surface mounting and soldering of off-the-shelf silicon chips, similar to rigid printed circuit board assemblies. This pick-and-place approach not only reduces device flexibility, but also leads to interconnection challenges that severely compromise device reliability.  This project leverages a thin film recrystallization process where equivalent silicon circuits can now be patterned directly into flexible silicon, resulting in a highly scalable manufacturing process that drastically improves device reliability. By patterning all components directly into a high-temperature substrate, conformal electronics can be made that are durable even in heavy vibration and shock environments.  The project objectives include the transition of prototype recrystallization processes to a higher throughput and higher quality pilot-scale recrystallization system. The resulting flexible silicon substrates will then be used for preliminary development of integrated circuit fabrication to produce active silicon components as a step toward fully patterned System-on-Foil electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industry’s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.

    The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (Phase I) project is to reduce human and environmental health risks posed by Harmful Algae Bloom (HABs) impacts to water resources.  Communities across the nation allocate substantial financial resources to address HABs in their water bodies as HABs can be extremely toxic. However, this ecological problem can be treated as an eco-mining opportunity because HABs are tiny eco-miners that scour, collect, and concentrate excess nutrients in water bodies. The proposed technology is an eco-sensitive mining technology designed to harvest, trap, and permanently remove these HABs, their toxins, and the often ore-grade concentration of nutrients they contain. This project will advance a technology to permanently and sustainably removing the HABs, their toxins and the excess nutrients they contain. As a fully scalable and rapidly deployable, cost-effective technology, it will rapidly resolve HAB impairments and related health risks.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed project is to target HABs, trap them through mechanical filtration, separate them through flotation, and monitor and test the effluent water for toxins. The proposed research is focused on development of remote and automatic operation capabilities to further minimize potential contact with HABs.   The process can be deployed in less than one day to surround and control small or very large areas of HABs, does not require a land-based treatment area, and does not need electricity or high capacity pumping systems to work. It can trap and remove HABs actively or passively.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology that will reduce intraoperative nerve damage using fluorescence imaging to enable surgeons to see the unseen. Intraoperative nerve injury is a major complication of surgery, affecting all specialties and often causing irreparable damage. Nerve damage occurs in ~17% of all surgeries and intraoperative nerve injuries affect 50 million patients annually worldwide, incurring undue pain, loss of function, and high costs to the healthcare system. Currently, no clinically approved technology exists to enhance intraoperative nerve recognition - surgeons rely solely on anatomical knowledge and visualization. The proposed project will finalize development of first-in-kind nerve targeted substance allowing surgeons to “cut by color” – identifying and sparing nerves more effectively to reduce these complications and the associated costs, estimated at $12.5 billion annually.

    The proposed project is focused on the development of near-infrared nerve-specific fluorophores for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) that are clinically viable for translation to human studies. Recent work has allowed modification of the base structures of the fluorophores to significantly improve brightness, solubility, and toxicity while maintaining high nerve specificity. The immediate milestones of the work proposed herein include (1) characterization of a library of benzo[c]phenoxazine small molecule derivatives with chemically tuned water solubility and quantified nerve specificity, (2) elucidation of the biological target and mechanistic understanding of nerve-specificity for the fluorophores, (3) preliminary single-dose toxicology analysis in rodents, (4) quantified pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution to determine the optimal imaging dose and time window, and (5) identification of a lead compound for clinical translation. Successful completion of the proposed work will enable selection of a lead candidate with a proven safety profile and bright, long-lasting (~1 hour) nerve-specific fluorescence for identification of buried nerve structures at up to 1 cm depths.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to optimize a system to rapidly synthesize long, user-defined sequences of DNA as a commercial service. The process will be capable of producing error-free DNA fragments, each long enough to encode multiple genes, in 1-2 weeks, at a price that will be affordable even to university research labs. Researchers currently can purchase short DNA fragments that must be stitched together to make functional genes – which is labor-intensive and sometimes impossible – or pay vendors to do it. The ability to buy an intact group of genes on one piece of DNA will help deepen the understanding of all biological systems, from animals and plants to the bacteria and viruses that infect them. Easy access to long DNAs will also allow synthetic biologists to build completely novel biological devices, such as bacteria that manufacture vitamins or medicines, cells that detect and destroy cancer, or new sustainable food ingredients and novel biomaterials.

    The proposed project is focused on developing an enzymatic method for DNA synthesis that will alleviate several problems inherent to chemical DNA synthesis, the only method currently available commercially. Chemical synthesis works well for short DNA fragments, but high-quality synthesis is limited to <200 bases. Longer fragments often are created by stitching together many short fragments, but this process is unreliable for sequences that contain repeats or high AT or GC content. In the proposed enzymatic DNA synthesis method, a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is conjugated to the template-independent polymerase Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) by a cleavable linker. When presented with a DNA primer, the dNTP-TdT conjugate adds its tethered nucleotide and remains attached, blocking further elongation by other conjugates. Cleavage of the linker releases the TdT, to be washed away with unreacted conjugates, and exposes the oligo for extension with the next dNTP-TdT conjugate. These two steps of “extension” and “deprotection” are iterated to synthesize a defined sequence. The accuracy of the resulting DNA strand depends on the stability and cleavage efficiency of the linker. A variety of linkages and cleavage enzymes will be tested to yield >99.9% stability and cleavage in rapid, 30-second reactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a software application that identifies clinical outcomes to support high validity real-world evidence (RWE). Approaches to ensure data accuracy and protocol validity are critical to maintain safety and efficacy in healthcare.  This project will analyze electronic health data to generate clinically meaningful information for personalized treatment plans for patients with multiple conditions that can confound treatment. This technology will fulfill an unmet need to improve patient outcomes, improve healthcare delivery and chronic disease care management, and reduce healthcare costs for patients. This technology can also improve regulatory and reimbursement decision-making for therapeutic approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the need for consideration of using additional health data to allow for individualized personalized therapeutic plans for patients with multiple co-morbidities. Subgroup analysis or individualized therapy plans for precision medicine are currently not available based upon the structure of randomized controlled trials for broad conditions like breast cancer or hypertension. This proposal seeks to identify clinical outcomes from unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR). The proposed work is to develop analytics using natural language processing and inference to leverage the large amounts of health data from real-world evidence (RWE) and observational studies to augment data provided in randomized controlled trials (RCT). The analytic tools will allow a comparison of the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in defined cohorts of patients and develop a personalized treatment plan for an individual patient with multiple co-morbidities. The tasks include: 1) Leverage linguistic phrases extracted by natural language processing (NLP) to recognize outcome-related clinical findings to be maintained as clinical feature metadata; 2) Combine NLP and inference to accurately identify candidate clinical outcomes; and 3) Apply machine-learned and expert knowledge to accurately define complex outcome measures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, high-performance platform to monitor and characterize plankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be harmful or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns and economic consequences, such as billions lost annually in the aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms and sea lice. The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collections and evaluation. In contrast, the proposed platform may enable low-cost, portable and fast monitoring, as well as automated characterization of harmful aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, this platform will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets such as marine biology science and STEM education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, and production algae monitoring. The proposed technology is envisioned to have a significant societal impact and commercial potential.

    This project may result in a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput aquatic microobjects monitoring instrument.  The instrument will have a wide spectrum of applications and initial focus on aquaculture market. The technology will initially focus on early identification of specific microorganisms, such as sea lice and harmful algae as they are detrimental to the wellbeing of aquaculture animals. This demonstration will provide high quality data at an affordable price to ensure confidence and credibility to aquaculture farmers, marine scientists, and other users interested in aquatic microobjects characterization. To accomplish this plan, several operating regimes will be implemented enabling the device to switch from high-resolution (monitoring harmful algae) to high-throughput (identifying sea lice).  An autofluorescent camera module will be developed to further assist with differentiating microorganisms. Next, an innovative neural network framework will be developed and tested for identification of different types of sea lice and harmful algae. Finally, the system will be integrated into an environmentally protected enclosure and rigorously tested in laboratory, as well as in-field in realistic conditions. At the end of the Phase II program a prototype will be completed that will be designed in coordination with aquaculture partners and prospective users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient system for robust point-of-care blood tests.  The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and represent a bottleneck.  This Phase II effort will explore the design and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated by comparison
    of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead separation assay with a conventional centrifugation process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of improved thermal cooling solutions for mobile devices.  Cooling solutions today are often unable to meet the demands of 5G/6G telecommunications with thermal heating rates up to 10 times that of 4G technologies. Even current high performance 5G mobile phones have greatly increasing thermal loads, which, in turn, increase the external touch temperature of the smart phone and often trigger the phone to slow down its speed. The proposed technology may result in improved cooling for increased performance without limitations of performance throttling.  Enhancing thermal cooling capabilities of cutting edge mobile devices may help enable widespread adoption of 5G/6G telecommunications, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and big data applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a new passive micro-two-phase cooling based on pulsating heat pipes, which consist of a loop of microchannels in a flat plate in which oscillations of the coolant in the serpentine are generated by vapor bubbles to pump liquid and vapor to transport higher heat loads.  The design harnesses complex self-induced pulsations to better perform the work of transferring larger quantities of heat by enhancing the pulsating heat pipe's fluid motion with localized obstructions to create distributed bubble nucleation points. The same obstructions will be used to improve the micro-thermal heat transfer processes. The project introduces microfluidics to pulsating heat pipes.  The research objectives of the proposed project are to demonstrate substantial improvements in thermal performance compared to competing cooling technology (vapor chambers) at the same thin form factors.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology, based on naturally occurring small molecules proven to strongly activate plant’s natural defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed innovation is active at extremely low concentrations, can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic. Every year, approximately 500 million kg of more than 600 different chemical pesticide types are used; this costs an estimated $10 billion and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests and pathogens. By providing an alternative, effective method for managing diseases in crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals, synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance development. The proposed research will establish viability of a natural small molecule as a crop protectant and can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides and significantly enhancing global food security.

    The proposed project seeks to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small, naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants. The proposed project will demonstrate a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy under field conditions, adversely affecting neither seed germination/ growth nor natural microbe/insect populations. The project objectives are to 1) Perform multi-location field trials with wheat and soybean against three high-impact pathogens to confirm efficacy of seed treatments; 2) Conduct greenhouse studies to investigate potential synergies of seed and spray treatments, including in combination with other crop protection agents; 3) Determine effects of seed or spray treatments on nematode infestation in soybean; 4) Scale chemical synthesis of the active ingredient and optimize the seed-coating formulation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the efficiency of air traffic operations and increase airport and airspace capacity utilization, enabling reductions in emissions, noise impact, flight delays, and operational costs of airports and airlines. The anticipated result is to produce a software platform that will become an industry standard used by 200 major metropolitan airports and over 50 airlines globally, addressing an available market of over $100 Million. The technology may contribute to a sustainable future aviation system that enables economic growth, while minimizing environmental impact. Preliminary development and testing of the technology in New York indicates the potential to increase airport and airspace capacity by as much as 20%, with savings for delays, fuel burn, noise impact and controller workload from 10%-21%, and cost savings of $2 Billion/year. The proposed innovation may increase the understanding of airspace operations and related trade-offs by bridging the gap between aviation professionals and the public through 3D visualizations of proposed airspace changes and quantification of their expected impacts on the environment and safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a software platform for integrated airspace and airport system planning, design, and management. Currently, airport authorities, airlines, and air navigation service providers use legacy software tools for the above. These tools are outdated and difficult to use, fail to properly quantify trade-offs between design objectives, and produce unsustainable design solutions leading to sub-optimal system performance. The research objectives of this project are to unify the disjointed functions of design, planning and performance evaluation of airport operations, quantify trade-offs between competing design objectives, and optimize for system efficiency in terms of maximizing safety and capacity while minimizing delays, emissions, noise, fuel burn and operational cost. To achieve this, the company will work with major airports and airlines to identify key requirements, develop tractable mathematical models for addressing the tasks and validate the results via application in real operational environments. The anticipated technical result is a unified software platform that will enable airports/airlines to be more efficient, while also balancing operational, societal, and environmental objectives in building a sustainable aviation system for the future.

    \ Phase II project is to help patients living with diabetes. The disease accounts\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device supporting multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. The success of this project would not only benefit patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce health care expenditures by decreasing the length of hospitalization as well as associated medical resources. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research brings together academic collaborators from different fields of expertise. The project provides a unique experience and training for engineers and scientists in the fields of neural interface design and medical device experiments, bridging the gap between the engineering and medical communities, as well as promoting and cultivating future neural engineers to focus on developing emerging/unmet diagnostic and therapeutic devices for improving human health.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops and demonstrates a wireless, miniaturized, intraluminal bioelectronic capsule capable of performing on-demand neuromodulation and multi-modality sensing on the gastrointestinal tract, supporting closed-loop neuromodulation. The device will be tested and characterized on benchtop and also through porcine models to demonstrate its potential for treating and monitoring post-surgical complications. The lengthy process of diagnosing and treating post-surgical complications significantly increases healthcare costs. Costs from hospitalization time alone exceed $2,000 per day for post-operative ileus alone.  Additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could reduce hospitalization time, accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life for patients. The success of this project has the potential to bring disruptive impact and revolution to the current pharmaceutical-based post-surgical management and treatment. In addition, the technology developed during this project may be useful to treat other chronic diseases and injuries that are incurable pharmaceutically.  The technique may be used as research tools for investigating the biological mechanisms and new therapeutics for different diseases.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be improvement of quality of life and reduction of healthcare costs associated with tendon and ligament injuries which are notoriously difficult and slow to heal, depriving millions of Americans years of productivity. Tendon and ligament injuries are especially debilitating for the aged, the active or those with physically demanding professions. Injured ligaments (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament)  or tendons (e.g. Achilles) require months of rehabilitation and can take up to a year to heal. In the elderly, rotator cuff injuries are pernicious, prevalent and refractory to treatment. Every year in the US, $130 billion is spent on musculoskeletal injury-related medical visits, 60% of which are tendon and ligament injuries. Tendon and ligament injuries result in 288 million lost work days costing the US economy $50 billion annually. In spite of decades of effort, there has been very little improvement in either the rate or the quality of healing for these injuries. The injectable repair system proposed could reduce healing time and improve repair quality. The proposed plan to drastically reduce the cost of the raw materials through human cell engineering will make the treatment solution universally affordable.

    The proposed project will determine the feasibility of an entirely new approach to tendon and ligament repair based upon the in vivo delivery and assembly of collagen monomers into the path of force. The approach is derivative of two recent innovations that will be combined in four objectives to produce an injectable collagen-based solution designed to accelerate the repair of damaged connective tissues (i.e. ligaments and tendons) the healing of which presents a significant medical challenge. The first innovation is the use of CRISPR/CAS9 technology which will be used to accelerate the production of collagen by human fibroblasts. Objective 1 will to optimize the CRISPR process and scale it up through isolation and expansion of cells receptive to enhanced collagen production. Objective 2 will leverage the second major innovation, liquid crystal collagen processing technology, to develop a shelf stable injectable solution of highly-dense particulates that is expected to donate large amounts of collagen to injured connective tissue. Objective 3 will demonstrate that the injectable repair solution will deliver collagen to repair damage in vitro and Objective 4 will apply the approach in vivo, to demonstrate that exogenous collagen delivery can speed the repair of damaged, living tendon.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a microfluidic assay for applications related to drug discovery/screening, personalized medicine, drug toxicity assessment, evaluation of patient clinical status, and predicting patient-specific responses to certain therapies. The proposed platforms allow drug testing under specific physiological conditions to investigate how certain drugs or drug combinations might affect specific cells. Currently available platforms are extremely complex and rely on costly, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and low-throughput fabrication methods, hampering the translation potential of such systems into a commercial setting. Moreover, standardization and analytic validation of such platforms are needed for reproducible and reliable sample testing, facilitating the process of regulatory approval. This project will significantly help standardize and validate a high-throughput platform for deployment at scale. This project will help reduce operational costs for preclinical drug discovery/screening studies and lower the drug failure rate, as patient-specific testing will be possible.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a standardized and validated microfluidic platform integrated with human endothelial cells for drug discovery/screening purposes. Since the traditional in vivo and in vitro techniques that are employed in the preclinical stage of drug development are extremely costly, labor intensive, time-consuming, and can still lead to high failure rates, there is an urgent need for physiologically relevant in vitro assays for preclinical assessment of new drug candidates, particularly in the cardiovascular disease and blood disorders spaces. Microfluidic platforms allow for precise control of gas and flow conditions at a size scale equivalent to that of human microvasculature and offer physiologically relevant vascularized environments for in vitro testing. To ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the assay, research objectives include a comprehensive and systematic approach to standardize the culture and activation of endothelial cells under physiologic flow conditions. Furthermore, standardized both short-term and long-term activation of endothelial cells via disease specific activators (e.g., heme, TNF-α, etc.) will be established to better mimic in vivo conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting parameters. Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually.  However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients’ quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help advance the health and welfare of individuals living with retinal and neurological disease. This includes multiple sclerosis (MS)—a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A fully automated, wearable, and low-cost retinal imaging device will be developed for use in both clinical and home settings that detects changes in the retina, allowing patients and their physicians to more routinely track treatment efficacy and ocular side effects. Early detection and treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and positively impact the research and care of other retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal pathology. While OCT is a widely-used modality for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for unsupervised use by patients at home. This includes a ruggedized and ergonomic design suited for those who suffer from low vision, low mobility, and other symptoms that make frequent trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly as often as prescribed by their doctor, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Complete development of a clinical-grade beta prototype that is suitable for use in clinical and home settings, 2) Develop a software pipeline for automated image analysis and report, and 3) Conduct a usability study in a cohort of AMD patients with varying degrees of vision loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20% and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776 million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, 11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain diabetic foot ulcers each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible, robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the prototype and scale up hardware production.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the development of disruptive technologies that use drones and artificial intelligence to monitor livestock.  Almost 75% of United States cattle are purchased by taking out bank loans, and lenders need to audit cattle inventories for collateral verification and appraisal purposes.  Additionally, more than 140,000 ranchers need to monitor their herds and detect cattle illnesses before infections spread.  The proposed technology will leverage aerial imaging and artificial intelligence to count cattle, characterize cattle weight, and diagnose cattle illnesses up to one week before clinical symptoms appear.  The ability to count herds regularly will enable ranchers to discover cattle rustling issues early and provide banks with a reliable way to perform collateral verification on ranches and feedlots, ensuring that banks can continue extending livestock operations the loans that they need to survive.  The ability to detect cattle illnesses early is expected to reduce cattle mortalities, the economic cost of antibiotic use, and possibly antibiotic resistance in humans.  Ultimately, the proposed technology that will be developed for monitoring cattle promises to also transform the way that land and marine wildlife, fisheries, and endangered species are monitored.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide cattlemen and bankers with an efficient way to detect and count cattle on pastures and ranches, estimate livestock weight, and identify ill cows before they spread infection further.  Despite daily monitoring of cattle herds, small discrepancies and losses are undiscoverable, and bovine illnesses are often left undetected until they spread, infecting more cattle and requiring large-scale administration of antibiotics.  Machine learning and image processing tools will be developed that (a) automatically analyze natural and thermal drone images to count cattle on multi-topography ranches and estimate livestock weight and (b) discriminate between healthy and ill cattle based on aerial radiometric imaging. The outcomes will be (1) a ready, drone-agnostic solution for counting cattle and estimating their weight and (2) a pilot-tested drone-and-software system for monitoring cattle health via radiometric imaging and notifying cattlemen about cows with suspected illness in real-time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that poisoning by prescription drugs affects over one million people annually and is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Other than opioids, prescribed benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants are the most common causes of accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. Drug testing plays a central role in the detection and management of poisoned patients, and the ability to rapidly identify the cause and institute prompt targeted treatment has the potential to reduce morbidity and save lives. Currently, screening of blood and other biological fluids for toxic drug levels requires specimen processing, taking hours or days to obtain results from commercial laboratories. Immediate, accurate, low-cost testing for urgent care in the ambulance or emergency room will improve outcomes for the rapid diagnosis and care of patients after accidental poisoning and attempted suicide. The biosensor device and drug testing methods described in this project can be performed for low cost at the first point of contact and are scalable for rapid commercial and clinical adoption into a global drug screening market valued at $1.1 billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a new solid-state biosensor device reporting real-time and accurate quantification of toxic drug levels in the blood using inexpensive, disposable test strips similar to a diabetes glucometer or from saliva like a sublingual electronic thermometer. Current drug toxicity assays use specialized laboratory methods that require blood sample processing and can take hours to days to obtain results. Biosensors are an interface between biology and electronics that convert specific chemical information into measurable electronic signals (e.g. a glucometer). The three specific outcomes of this project will be; 1) a handheld medical device providing accurate and real-time measurement of blood levels of all classes of antipsychotic, neuroleptic, and anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use, and other common drugs of abuse, from a drop of blood or saliva, 2) validation of the accuracy of the biosensor for target drugs relative to current laboratory analysis methods (e.g., mass spectroscopy), and 3) demonstration that the biosensor can distinguish between classes of medications, drugs of abuse, and potential clinical interferents in blood using specific analytical methods and modifiable biosensor coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the challenges posed to the US healthcare system resulting from neurologic disease and trauma impacting 100+ million patients in the US alone and associated costs in excess of $1.3 trillion, driven by a lack of diagnostic tools detecting the onset of disease before it affects neuronal tissue beyond repair. Neurologic biomarkers represent a promising new approach to this challenge, comprising 10% of the $53 billion global biomarker market and growing at a 14.5% compound annual growth rate. This Phase I project aims to provide neurologic biomarker-based low-cost blood testing products for research and patient care, providing novel diagnostic information. It is anticipated that changes from baselines resulting from concussions, onset of dementia, brain tumors or neurologic disease, can be detected early, thereby allowing for timely intervention.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is based on the finding that specific immune cells (phagocytes) in the peripheral blood can serve as diagnostic indicators of brain health. It is well established that these cells are recruited to the injured or diseased brain in order to clear the cellular debris resulting from the inflammatory response. While current methods seek to identify neurologic biomarkers in blood serum, where they are very dilute and difficult to detect, this project aims to make use of the finding that debris-loaded cells can reenter the blood stream.  The proposed project will develop technologies and instrumentation to capture and quantify these phagocytes from small amounts of blood (e.g. finger prick), to identify the specific cell types involved, and assay their brain-specific biomarker content. Since the normal protein turnover affects the brain as well, blood samples from cognitively normal donors will be tested to establish a baseline concentration of these biomarker-carrying phagocytes and their cargo.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand access to quality health care for underserved populations.  The proposed project develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant, women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example. The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips. Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules, such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the paper lateral flow strips.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project advances the translation of hydrogen technologies in heavy duty and ultra-duty applications. The hydrogen economy could generate an estimated $2.5 T in economic value in the manufacturing, transportation, energy storage, and building energy, sectors.  Current membranes that require high humidity levels and low temperatures for operation complicates fuel cell thermal and water management components in heavy duty fuel cell systems. The proposed solution advances the development of a new membrane serving as a drop-in replacement to enable low humidity and elevated operating temperatures.

    This SBIR Phase I project will use porous polymer supports to translate a nanocomposite material that exhibits both low humidity and elevated temperature proton conductivity into a standardized solution for a proton exchange membranes. Furthermore, the composite materials will be added at high volume fractions to confer additional benefits in mechanical stability and lower gas permeability. The project activities include material translation into supported membranes, membrane composite formulation optimization, measurements of key membrane properties, and demonstration in a fuel cell stack. If successful, the project would yield new proton exchange membranes that enable operation under low humidity – elevated temperature conditions to simplify fuel cell systems while extending system durability.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to help applications of augmented reality, location-based search, and real-time live mapping of the world, and to build a digital twin of the earth. Event information is dynamic and hyperlocal. Thus it is important to ground the location and time of events to real GPS coordinates and universal time. This creates technical challenges of entity disambiguation and resolution, and real-time processing event information to reflect last-minute changes. The proposed natural language grounding work also helps create a mirrorworld with information interlinked between the virtual internet and physical spaces and events.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the first to investigate neural language model pre-training over semi-structured hypertext on a web scale (55TB of compressed data monthly). This will greatly accelerate understanding of noisy web text, while the majority of research to date has been conducted on clean plain text only. This project will also attack the challenge of machine reading with document-level annotations in a semi-supervised fashion, while the predominance of study has been carried out with more precise word-level annotation in a fully supervised way. The technical goal of this project is to create a scalable infrastructure that allows quick iterations of mining web scale data, and an ensemble of algorithms that are adapted to learning structured information over hypertext. It is an unsolved challenge for most small businesses that in the past only the internet giants have attempted. The resulting machine learning algorithms will be capable of interpreting semi-structured web data, in contrast to typical structured annotation to understand hypertext.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a significant increase to the security of healthcare safe public-private blockchain protocols. The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the array of new opportunities it creates for expanding uses of machine intelligence. By providing an efficient way to transform deep learning models to best fit the constraints on end devices and real-time applications, this project will shorten the time to market for artificial intelligence applications by orders of magnitude, and hence significantly accelerate the development and deployment of intelligent software in health, commerce, financial, defense, social networks, and many other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the important barriers for efficient development of real-time Artificial Intelligence applications on end devices (smartphones, drones, etc.). It does this through a breakthrough technology, compression-compilation co-design. Compression and compilation are the two key steps in fitting a deep learning model on a hardware for efficient execution. Model compression reduces the size of deep learning models; compilation generates executable codes from a given deep learning model. The principle of compression-compilation co-design is to design the two components for AI in a hand-in-hand manner. The technology uses a novel approach to synergize a set of novel model compression methods with compression-aware code compilation techniques. The result is a technology that achieves several-fold higher artificial intelligence model compression rates over the state of the art, several times faster speed, better energy efficiency, and satisfying accuracy.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project falls within the larger scope of expanding artificial intelligence (AI) methods into health care applications. The application is focused on image guided endovascular surgical procedures for intracranial aneurysms (IA), which may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most devastating type of hemorrhagic stroke. The current trends in treatment of aneurysms show that endovascular approach has become the mainstay procedure due to reduced surgical complications when compared with open skull surgery. Despite tremendous technological advances in devices and surgical instrumentation, as many as 30% of these lesions are not completely healed after the first surgical intervention, exposing patients to additional risks for complications due to multiple surgical procedures. The AI autonomous solution developed in this project will be the one of the first applications that provides intraoperative prognosis for six-month healing of an aneurysm after each surgical step to allow surgical adjustments, reducing the risk for ruptures and re-treatments from 30% to an estimated 5% and creating savings for the $65,000 in retreatments (roughly $1.95 B annually in the U.S.).

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will aim to develop a comprehensive and autonomous AI method that will provide intraoperative prognosis of complete healing for an IA at six months. In current clinical practice, neuro-interventionalists cannot guarantee successful healing of intracranial aneurysms immediately post-device placement. Treated patients have to wait a minimum of 3-6 months before their aneurysm is reassessed on medical imaging and the clinician decides if re-treatment is needed. During this critical time, patients are still at risk of rupture. In addition, re-treatments have higher risk to the patient as well as bear a financial burden on hospitals and insurance companies. The proposed algorithms will be fully integrated with surgical equipment and will allow dynamic angiographic analysis to derive physics-based parameters related to the nature of blood flow inside the aneurysm sac. These parameters are combined with a machine learning algorithm to provide a prediction as to whether the treatment is sufficient for a full healing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable novel binary code AI applications for cybersecurity, by providing a fast and accurate method to reverse-engineer executable code. Current solutions are slow and inaccurate, and the volume of code analyzed by cybersecurity applications is huge.  Cybersecurity companies either deploy tremendous computing resources to handle huge volumes of code or only extract superficial features from code for AI models, making those solutions extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  The proposed solution will not only save computing resources but will allow for improved solutions by extracting complex features from executable code and applying more advanced AI models.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides an innovative disassembly solution for binary code. The lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. The proposed solution combines state-of-the-art binary analysis techniques and newly emerging deep learning techniques to build a fast and accurate disassembler.  The proposed solution utilizes GPU technology to accelerate the disassembly process.  The final disassembly is expected to be over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art disassemblers, while achieving the same or better accuracy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development and adoption of next generation portable energy storage devices.  Lithium-ion batteries are the most common energy storage technology for a wide variety of applications. Most recently, they have been adopted by small to medium sized Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and electric vehicles (EV). The weight carrying capacity and flight/operating time and range of these UAS and EV are issues mainly dependent on battery components and materials.  With the proposed lithium-ion battery technology, high-capacity, lightweight, and advanced batteries may store significantly more energy without increasing their weight. The development and integration of the next generation battery technology may significantly increase the performance of battery powered vehicles and their adoption by society. This technology has the potential to have a drastic commercial impact in the UAS/drone industry; For example, with successful batteries, medicine, blood, and organs can be quickly delivered to remote locations on unmanned platforms. Utility workers may be able to identify pipeline leaks or transmission line damages in advance of an accident and packages may be delivered faster, with significantly less carbon footprint, along with myriad of other applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop high capacity, lightweight lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells with a novel carbon-based anode component. Existing LIBs still utilize graphite with additives as the primary anode material due to their ability to restore the charge and provide consistency in voltage. However, graphite's limited capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of long lasting, higher energy density (over 340 Wh/kg) LIBs. Graphite's internal structure limits sufficient lithium diffusion into interlayer spaces. This project offers a new class of higher energy density (over 500 Wh/kg) LIBs, with an innovative multilayer graphenic anode.  Replacing graphite with the multilayer graphenic anode offers a solution in overcoming the issue of the  limited capacity of the carbon anode. This patent-pending, commercially feasible, only carbon-based anode has the unique capability of an intense lithium (Li) intercalation within its networks. The large Li/electrolyte interface contributes enhanced charge-transfer kinetics, resulting in effective charge/discharge cycling throughout hundreds of cycles with over 1500 mAh/g specific capacity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the economics of farming. Machines with good computer perception of plant geometry can implement farming practices that reduce the use of pesticides, fertilizer, water, and fuel. This will increase farm efficiency and provide long-term benefits to the environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new algorithms for estimation of plant structure from images. This is challenging because agricultural fields are often densely packed with plants, such that portions of each plant are hidden from view. Existing methods can estimate missing geometry of man-made objects from obstructed views, but plants are considerably more difficult, due to the complexity, variability, and visual ambiguity of their geometry. The project will aim to achieve levels of detail and accuracy not previously attained in plant imaging. To reach this goal, the project will use rapid iterations of field data collection, algorithm development, and field testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to improve fruit and vegetable storage and dairy powder production in situations that currently require additives and carrier agents during the high-temperature processing techniques. The creation of novel, high-quality, shelf-stable food products is an important step toward increasing food system sustainability and accessibility.  The team seeks to increase shelf-stability, reducing reliance on the expensive and limited cold chain. This technology has potential applications for pharmaceutical drug preservation. Additionally, global water shortages have increased reliance on desalination technologies that are expensive and environmentally taxing. With the potential cost, scalability, and portability benefits of the proposed separation technology, there is further potential for use in water treatment.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to further develop a hybrid separation technology combining supercritical fluids and sonication to instantly separate a solute and solvent at operational temperatures of 15-55 °C, with inputs as low as 1% solids.  The technology results in products with particles sizes of <10um to >250um and varying crystallization without hardware changes. By creating a continuous separation effect using velocity (supersonic flow as the kinetic driving force for phase separation instead of heat), the technology overcomes the end-product quality limitations of traditional thermal drying techniques, and has the potential to scale with attractive unit economics,.  This method is significantly more energy efficient than existing methodologies. Specifically, the technology can produce pure fruit, vegetable, and dairy powders without preprocessing concentration steps, additives, carrier agents, or thermal treatment.  The method may also be used to develop drug formulations for aerosol delivery and/or enhanced bioavailability, streamline sugar manufacturing to create co-energy generation, and potentially offer cost effective compact desalination systems to make drinkable water. The Phase II research seeks to design, construct, and optimize a scalable pilot system through computational fluid dynamics modeling, custom fabrication, and analytical testing to validate the unit economics and end-product attributes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality and efficiency of bedside spinal access procedures by developing a needle guidance system that interfaces with existing ultrasound machines. Lumbar punctures (LPs) are performed to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as meningitis. The traditional LP technique requires practitioners to manually feel for spinal landmarks to form a mental image of the anatomy before blindly inserting the needle into the spine, aiming for a small target containing spinal fluid. This methodology can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming and is highly dependent on practitioner experience and patient body type. Up to 42% of procedures fail to access the target. Failed cases require radiological intervention, increasing the cost of care, lengthening patient stay, and exposing patients to radiation. Hospitals in the United States lose an estimated $2 billion annually due to inefficiencies and failures in LPs. The proposed needle guidance system will enable bedside spinal access procedures to be performed under real-time ultrasound imaging, significantly improving first-attempt success rates. The guidance technology can further be applied in other clinical segments, improving the quality of care across a variety of needle-based procedures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) Complete development of a needle guidance system designed to interface with existing ultrasound machines; and 2) Develop an AI-powered anatomy detection software feature for the guidance system. These combined objectives will generate a functional, intuitive, and accessible solution that minimizes barriers to adoption while maximizing clinical and operational value. The proposed research involves conducting an array of safety and reliability studies to investigate the performance of the guidance system under realistic conditions. In developing a robust anatomy detection software feature, a spinal ultrasound data set will be created from a variety of non-patient volunteers. The data will be analyzed, processed, and used to train a machine learning model for anatomy detection. It is anticipated that the results of this project will demonstrate a sufficiently safe and efficacious system that can consistently guide a needle to an intended target with an error of less than 3 millimeters. The anatomy detection feature is expected to perform with at least 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity in identifying five key spinal landmarks; this level of performance would significantly reduce the knowledge barrier to performing ultrasound-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to increase the quality of consumer products and services by scaling the data sharing economy. Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are “messy" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with “feature stores,” which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to facilitate secure transactions.  The proposed project allows business transactions without the fear of cybercrime.  The expected cost reductions will enable a company to safely engage with individuals and families who cannot afford commonly available cybersecurity solutions. The proposed blockchain process will improve security and resilience of critical infrastructure including energy, transportation, finance, telecommunications, and manufacturing, as well as enabling true smart cities and installations of the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a multi-segment and multipath design for substantial transactional improvement and reduction in required computing resources. Computing resources required in blockchain usage primarily involve the searching of the complete blockchain for the appropriate record. The proposed solution eliminates the required search of the complete blockchain by segmenting the blockchain to search smaller segments.  This project will research, develop and implement a method for improving the current state of knowledge with resulting performance improvement of blockchain transactions without compromising the fidelity of the transaction, thereby eliminating the need for a blockchain Proof of Work Consensus Model. The project will research several blockchains as well as the consensus and non-consensus models for final implementation. Validation includes a baseline transaction measurement for each of the chosen blockchains identified before any modifications.

    \ The proposed filter utilizes a robust, porous, and surface charged tailored\
    \ sorbent of a novel coordination polymer framework prepared from an abundant\
    \ natural polyphenol. The sorbents possess molecular sieving ability, tailorable\
    \ pore size up to the pore dimension <2 nm, and functional coordination sites\
    \ for high binding affinity for lithium ions. The novelty of the innovation over\
    \ current technologies (e.g., solar evaporation and ion-exchange techniques) is\
    \ nano-based filter technology with selective affinity for lithium, enabling rapid\
    \ and efficient extraction and recovery of lithium. The research objective is\
    \ to demonstrate the proof-of-concept for recovery within 24 hours as either lithium\
    \ chloride or lithium carbonate with targeted recovery efficiency and conversion\
    \ >90% in a subsequent step. The project includes: (1) Fabricating the membrane\
    \ from the molecular sieves, (2) evaluating the lithium sieving performance, recovery,\
    \ and conversion, and (3) fabricating a prototype filter unit. These developments\
    \ will directly address current limitations in extraction time and efficiency,\
    \ cost, recovery efficiency of lithium, and environmental impact of solar evaporation,\
    \ ion-exchange and solvent extraction, and osmosis membrane systems.\n\nThis award\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to unleash the potential of water as a thermal energy storage medium for building air conditioning. Today’s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns.  First, materials testing will be completed after a year’s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to close gaps in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) proficiency, improving participation and sustained achievement, particularly for historically underserved student populations. Learning science has validated that the mathematical sciences are processed experientially — through seeing, moving, doing, perceiving — but current educational solutions generally do not explore this learning modality.  This platform will utilize Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and advanced analytics to scale these best practice pedagogies for both students and teachers. The aim of this project is to actualize the vision of technology-assisted STEM learning and operationalize it across the US K-12 system to close long-standing barriers to access and proficiency at scale.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform offers a way to rapidly close significant learning gaps students are facing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate how multimodal and game-driven learning in IVR can be used to enhance math proficiencies and the ability to transfer mathematical knowledge across contexts.  Such abilities have so far eluded incumbent learning technologies and interventions for math. In particular, this research may culminate in an experiential solution for students to learn Algebra efficiently, effectively, and purposefully. Immersed in relevant real-world contexts, students will use tactile 3D tools, movement, and a research-based pedagogical framework to build lasting fluency with math concepts while solving high impact problems. The platform will leverage the latest advances in data analysis to personalize learning experiences based on individual behaviors, skills and goals. This solution provides teachers with real-time data on student thinking so they can closely monitor, identify, and support priority students while providing timely feedback during critical cognitive moments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce a fusion-based engine in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive. The ultimate system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy.  Since the system is small and has low radiation, it also has applications for manned space flight.  This new engine could enable more direct and shorter flights to other planets, which minimizes the exposure of astronauts to the radiation encountered in outer space.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue the companies research on using a harmonic well to produce fusion by particle kinetic energy, rather than general thermal energy. The proposed concept utilizes a new heat engine technique that always maintains the plasma distribution function in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the proposed fusion system, a plasma is created in a specially designed harmonic well and then induced to form into two counter-oscillating spinning rings. When the two rings collide at the center of the well, the particle velocities are high enough to cause fusion.   This phase of the project will increase the energetics of the device. The project will move up to deuterium, a fuel which is twice as heavy as hydrogen (the current fuel) and has a much larger cross-section for fusion. The proposed approach is expected to make the harmonic well sufficiently energetic to produce deuterium-on-deuterium fusion by increasing the natural oscillation frequency of the well to give ion collision speeds of about one million meters per second. The project expects to be able to detect the neutrons produced by the fusion, demonstrating aneutronic fusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the viability of a new manufacturing process for on-chip lasers for silicon photonics using printed nanomaterial inks. The difficulty of a scalable method for fabricating on-chip, multi-color lasers is a major challenge for the silicon photonics market. Specifically, today's standard manufacturing of photonic chips does not include on-chip lasers. Without integration of laser engines to drive the circuits, the market potential of light chips is constrained by design and price. The technology developed here can allow foundries to mass produce chips with lasers and open multiple new markets for silicon photonics including wearable photonic sensors, optical data transfer, autonomous vehicle light detection and ranging, quantum information, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and healthcare applications such as immunoassay tests and medical imaging.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops on-chip embedded lasers to enable fully functional silicon photonic chip manufacturing. Currently, the laser solutions being employed in silicon photonics include bonded lasers and heterogeneous integration. The system integrators that assemble silicon photonics modules rely on often cumbersome methods of gluing individual lasers to silicon chips, keeping costs high and throughput well below desired levels. The photonic inks developed here will overcome this challenge by enabling an in-foundry laser solution via wafer-scale additive manufacturing. The photonic ink emits broad-spectrum light covering the visible to the near-infrared range and can be tailored to emit at specific wavelength bands relevant to different markets by altering the number of atomic layers. The goals of this Phase I project are to demonstrate electroluminescence from a p-n junction made from doped, few-layer nanomaterials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve quality control in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The compressed tablet is the most popular pharmaceutical dosage form in use worldwide. Despite its well-established manufacturing processes, issues with tablet quality are frequent. Issues in its design and manufacturing have the potential to make significant medical and financial impacts as failures in quality may result in harm to patients, product recalls, and medicine shortages. The proposed Ultrasonic Measurement Instrument (UMI) unit will substantially shorten drug tablet design/development cycles and detect/identify manufacturing and quality problems before release. Its utilization in modern continuous manufacturing lines will minimize the risk of defective tablet production/disposition and costly product recalls/disposals. The UMI unit will lead to two distinct solutions: (i) a real-time preventive quality monitoring device for continuous manufacturing production line and (ii) a stand-alone laboratory equipment for characterizing tablet physical properties. The target users for our UMI-based products include pharmaceutical manufacturers; equipment providers; generic drug manufacturers; R&D groups and drug development teams in corporations and universities; and compounding pharmacies.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project and its ultrasonic approach have several critical advantages over the competing quality assessment and monitoring technologies for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Unlike other detection techniques, ultrasound directly interacts with the mass density, material elasticity/viscoelasticity, defects/cracks, and inhomogeneities of a medium and piezoelectric transducers are the most sensitive devices for transient strain sensing. Operating in MHz frequency, ultrasonic techniques make rapid (micro-seconds scale) measurements at relevant wavelengths for tablet and defect sizes (micrometer to millimeter scales). Challenges to be addressed include: (i) existing wave propagation models for viscoelastic tablet materials with microstructures are inadequate for accurate materials characterization/valuation with ultrasound, and (ii) a precise handling and positioning apparatus for tablets is needed, as for machine learning and data analytics/mining, the repeatable acquisition and processing of large data sets are required. The main outcome of the project is a proof-of-concept testing/measurement unit (UMI) with a precise tablet handling sub-system and its accompanying mathematical algorithms for the formation of large data sets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves both reduced costs for technology companies as well as increased access to cutting-edge engineering jobs for people from all backgrounds.  Commercializing this product will provide the market with an innovative, automated solution that reduces the time hiring managers spend on recruiting and growing the best candidates.  Until now, metacognitive skill development has been the purview of in-person mentors – a practice that provides fewer on-ramps into engineering careers for individuals from backgrounds historically underrepresented in technology as they often lack access to in-person engineer mentors. A scalable system which delivers metacognitive benefits to users in an automated way may create greater access to technology education by reducing the need for in-person mentorship. The product will also enable job seekers to enhance their engineering potential by strengthening the "hard to teach" practices which distinguish professional engineers from aspiring ones. Overall, the product commercialized during Phase II seeks to increase broader participation in engineering careers and a more equitable set of hiring practices in technology companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project brings cutting-edge Cognitive Science to bear on the problems of manual candidate screening and ongoing employee upskilling. For the first-time, it marries an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and opens the door to build talent pipelines for individuals whose metacognitive traits match closely with the needs of tech employers.  The proposed project combines key advances in the field of Cognitive Science with best practices in software design in order to create novel user interactions inside a Computer-Based Learning Environment (CBLE).  Objectives include: 1) collecting microdata (also called "trace data") from user interactions to make automated inferences about the user's metacognitive traits and 2) creating inputs designed to foster metacognitive growth.  Correlating real-time trace data with metacognitive ability is a new area of research enabled only recently by the increased adoption of CBLEs.  The proposed project contributes to the fields of Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction by validating novel methods measuring metacognition against existing static look-back techniques. The project also pioneers new modes of delivering personalized metacognitive growth through CBLE interaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to enable doctors to treat previously untreatable cancerous tumors through the development of a smart surgical needle. There are many clinical situations in which a patient cannot receive curative surgery because of the proximity of the tumor to critical anatomy; for example, the central bile duct in liver cancer. In these cases, patients are forced to decide between a number of non-curative treatments that have poor outcomes and significant side effects. Innovation in early-stage tumor treatments will expand treatment options to under-served communities and patient populations. Liver cancer, for example, disproportionately affects Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-American populations in the US, with as many as 30% to 66% patients never receiving any treatment. One reason is that surgical treatments require significant operating room infrastructure (for example, three-dimensional medical imaging) to provide high-quality outcomes; unfortunately these facilities are concentrated in research hospitals and access is not widespread. The technology developed here will address these tumors, and will apply to the more than 600,000 patients in the US yearly that suffer from cancers of the liver, kidney, lung, and breast.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of small-size sensors to transform ablation technology into a first-line treatment for all cancerous tumors. By placing imaging sensors onto the tip of a needle, the device can overcome performance limits encountered when using traditional image guidance. This increased performance, in combination with real-time image analysis, can sense temperature variation in a variety of tissues. The ability to sense temperature variation will be combined with needle tip-based energy delivery to provide an all-in-one closed loop ablation device, with the capability to treat previously untreatable tumors.  This project will demonstrate the application of deep-learning techniques, combined with physics based simulations, to enable precision ablation monitoring.  Subsequently the ablation monitoring will be combined with ablation control to test the feasibility of precise closed-loop ablation in ex vivo tissue with sufficient accuracy for future clinical implementation. This foundational work will then guide the development of the desired needle probe embodiment.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a new approach to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders, with an initial application of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US.  The proposed technology will address the microbial population in the gut, which significantly affects GI health. This technology uses advanced techniques of microbiology to develop a new set of therapeutics geared toward sustaining a healthy microbial population in the GI system.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I grant proposes to develop phage-resistant bacterial therapeutics to effectively alter the gut microbiome and treat disease. A key impediment to the use of live bacteria as therapeutics is their failure to reliably establish colonization in the gut. Although most focus to date has been on the bacterial components of the microbiome, bacteriophages, viruses which directly attack bacteria, make up at least half of the organisms in the human gut. Significantly, phages have been shown to influence the colonization dynamics of bacteria in every ecosystem studied thus far. Virulent populations of bacteriophages in the gut, which deplete commensal bacterial species, have been identified in patients with disease. Bacterial therapies with engineered immunity to gut phages will be developed to drive effective colonization in the gut. The endogenous immune system of bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas system, will be harnessed to engineer immune strains and develop targeted bacterial immunity against virulent phages. This work will enable development of a new class of bacterial therapeutics that overcome previous challenges and effectively colonize the gut. These therapies can be applied to treat the wide range of conditions associated with the microbiome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the identification of treatments for vascular leak disorders. Uncontrolled vascular leak disorders are common pathological processes that lead to tissue damage across multiple organs and over 60 clinical conditions. Currently, there are no drug-based therapies that address vascular leaks. Available solutions are focused on providing supportive care or decreasing inflammation, without addressing the underlying mechanism. This project is proposing a new approach to repair vascular leaks as a therapeutic intervention. By establishing the first drug discovery workflow for the identification of small molecules that repair vascular leakage, this project will enable the development of a pipeline of drugs for multiple conditions. The first condition targeted will be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which accounts for 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is the leading cause of mortality in ICU. Globally, it affects more than 3 million patients yearly. The proposed solution will decrease the number of deaths and the costs for ICU.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a new structure-based drug screening platform designed to identify small molecules that activate the molecular pathways responsible for repairing vascular leakage. The proposed platform consists of a unique combination of novel machine learning methods for ligand-binding site prediction, fast docking algorithm capable of screening ultra-large (over a billion molecule) compound libraries with targeted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profile within minutes (5,000 compounds/second). The AI-guided docking approach is combined with in vitro high-throughput assays measuring the mechanisms of vascular leak in a physiologically relevant microenvironment of human tissues to select candidates targeting vascular leak disorders. In this project, the steps of this tiered workflow will be validated and applied to the first target, leading to the identification of a set of new drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to train physicians efficiently, assure high-quality patient care, and provide the United States with a robustly competent physician workforce. Current assessment practices require attending physicians and surgeons to review tens-to-hundreds of data points, removing them from clinical activities. Integrating a machine learning model in an existing resident assessment system to predict performance can address trainees’ learning needs and identify excelling, competent, and struggling residents months earlier. This is vital to patient care: earlier identification of trainee performance can benefit patient care faster than the current human-based, semiannual process. Improved tracking and documentation of competence may be of interest to multiple stakeholders including patients, hospitals, third-party payers such as insurance companies or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the residency accreditation entity, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Improved, automated assessment models using existing trainee data help training programs facing increasing documentation burden, as well as hospitals and third-party payers interested in reducing adverse health events for the patients they serve.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate an artificial intelligence model to support resident physician training programs in customizing training based on individual learners’ needs. Starting with plastic and reconstructive surgery and one of the four training programs in the United States engaged in time-variable training is an efficient way to create, test, and assess the model’s efficacy. The created machine learning model will be assessed for its predictive ability at different points during resident physicians’ training and compared with attending physicians’ assessments of trainees’ skills. Such models make time-variable training feasible enabling adaptive, needs-based scheduling of various educational rotations. This has the added advantages of keeping residents fully engaged in their training and returning faculty physicians to clinical care faster, improving job satisfaction and reducing risk of burnout. Ultimately, time-variable training and use of their associated machine learning models will reduce the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; accelerate the entry of new, fully competent physicians into the workforce; and retain valuable physician educators in the workforce.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is related to the underserved, emergent bilingual population in US school systems. In spite of their growing size (approximately 20 percent of the total US population), emergent bilinguals still do not have adequate support to succeed in academic settings and are often victims of a subtractive bilingualism process that favors the acquisition of English at the expense of the home language. The lack of adequate bilingual resources has led to a disproportionate misplacement of emergent bilinguals in special education as well as an increased drop-out rates in bilingual populations, in general, and Latino communities in particular. To address these problems, a recommendation system powered by machine-learning algorithms that will generate a personalized bundle of fun, bilingual literacy activities linked to a fully-automated bilingual assessment is proposed. The unique characteristic of this solution is that the personalized activities are generated automatically based on assessment results and activity performance. The goal of the activities is to develop the skills identified by the assessment as needing improvement, both in English and in the home language of the child.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the educational needs of the growing, school-age, emergent bilingual population (i.e. children in the school system whose home language is not English or only English), as well as the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic acumen for society as a whole. The main research objectives involve: a) designing game-like bilingual activities that can get the young child’s attention, b) developing age-appropriate and culturally-sensitive content for the bilingual activities, c) refining the speech recognizer to work well with children's speech in both Spanish and English, and d) implementing the latest trends in data-analysis and machine-learning technologies to develop a recommendation system that proposes personalized activities tailored to each child’s needs based on assessment results and activity performance. The research and development plan aims at developing an innovative product that stands out from existing solutions. The key differentiator features are: 1) its focus on bilingual children and its adaptability in accepting bilingual answers for the activities, 2) its capacity to help children develop speaking skills due to the integration of automatic measures of speech performance, and 3) its recommendation engine that suggests personalized bilingual activities for each student tailored to their specific needs.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is two-folds: (1) increasing the accessibility of construction lightweight aggregate (LWA) for the concrete industry and (2) conversion of waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA) to value-added products (i.e., construction LWA). Yearly, about 100 million tons of coal combustion ash is produced in the US, of which only about 60% is recycled and the rest is moved to the landfills. This imposes risks to human health and the environment. Meanwhile, accessibility of construction LWA that is traditionally produced from clay, slate, and shale is challenging for the concrete industry in some states due to the absence of local construction LWA manufacturers. Therefore, LWA must be imported from elsewhere in the country, increasing (i) the final cost for the material and (ii) greenhouse gas emission due to transportation. With an abundance of W-CCA landfills scattered throughout the US, LWA can be produced from this material near the landfill sites to increase the local accessibility of construction LWA for the concrete industry. By implementing this technology, the environmental impact of W-CCA will be reduced, natural resource consumption will be prevented, CO2 emission associated with material transportation will be reduced, and users can save money by having access to local construction LWA.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses hurdles associated with manufacturing a novel porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) produced from waste coal combustion ash (W-CCA). The melting properties of W-CCA enable the production of construction LWA with superior engineering properties, including increased water absorption/desorption capacity and concrete workability relative to traditional LWA.  The deliverables of this project include: (i) development of a LWA with desired sintering properties during pilot-scale production to assure technical feasibility of scaling-up the proposed technology, (ii) optimization of pilot-scale rotary kiln parameters translatable to large-scale production, (iii) demonstration of the superior engineering properties of LWA for concrete applications produced at lab pilot-scale, and (iv) demonstration of the non-leachability of W-CCA based LWA in encapsulated concrete applications.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is in development of fully-biodegradable disposable personal care products, particularly menstrual pads. In general, menstrual pads cannot be recycled or be composted by municipal facilities after use because of issues with the biodegradable hot-melt adhesives to construct and position them. Biodegradation may be the best way to reduce the environmental impact associated with them, particularly in geographies where municipal solid waste facilities are underdeveloped.  Ultimately, non-toxic, safe and effective disposable menstrual pads could improve quality of life for menstruating women and the environment, and provide a new commercial opportunity for producers in the US and around the globe.

    The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of synthesizing a combination of biodegradable thermoplastics and biological additives that will create a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). This PSA must performs well in commercial hot glue application machinery as well as in the intended products, completely and safely degrade within six months of use, and is commercially viable at scale. These parameters have yet to be met by biological-based adhesives. The research approach is as follows: First, develop and synthesize PSAs using a biological base polymer and biological-based biodegradable additives, including plasticizers, tackifiers, and compatibilizers to enhance the performance of the PSAs. Second, characterize PSAs based on established use and manufacturing requirements and optimize the composition to ensure the requirements are met. Third, test PSA compositions for degradation, including length of time required for complete biodegradation under landfill, soil, and water conditions, including marine environments.  Identify intermediate chemical molecules and structures that form as a result of the biodegradation process, determine their potential hazards on both the environment and the health of biological organisms.  This project will develop a biodegradable PSA that will meet manufacturing and performance standards in menstrual pads and show that the PSA can be fully biodegradable in less than six months under non-specialized environmental conditions, without the need of mechanochemical or photo degradation processes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.  Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks, develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed decisions.

    The research and development activities include: (1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps. These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods, potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaska’s environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-makers.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will be to recycle certain plastics into soil amendments to improve both environmental degradation and agricultural health.  Plastic waste is a persistent environmental pollutant partly due to the lack of comprehensive technologies to reduce the in-circulation inventory of these petrochemical products, and comparably low value of plastic-derived and recycled products. The carbon contained within mixed plastic waste represents both a significant pollutant, but also a potentially valuable alternative feedstock for domestic agriculture and regenerating degraded soils. Soil carbon is a key driver in building soil health, agricultural productivity and food security, as well as a significant reservoir for long-term carbon sequestration. This project remediates traditionally non-recyclable, low-value mixed plastic waste and transforms it into a high value compost-like material. The proposed research develops a low-cost, distributed, decentralized process suitable for small, remote, rural, marginalized and underrepresented communities to achieve sustainable, domestic solid waste management as well as build and regenerate soil health for self-sufficient local agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase I project will scale and optimize a plastic oxidation process that employs a novel high efficiency intramolecular modification of Fenton oxidation. The aqueous process utilizes a low-cost, green catalyst that does not require high temperatures or organic solvents to cleave and oxidize a wide range of commercial polymers into bioavailable long-chain fatty acids suitable as a soil microbe substrate and soil organic carbon amendment. Compared to the highly variable process of natural biodegradation, this reaction ensures complete remediation before environmental application through controlled chemical oxidation. This research will aim to characterize this novel process towards a scalable technoeconomic model to guide translation at scale. Methods include near-infrared spectroscopy to track the elimination of microplastics and other toxic components common to plastic waste processing. The plastic-derived, environmentally beneficial soil amendments will be further studied in greenhouse and field trials to evaluate key agronomic indicators, such as amendment-microbe interactions, soil health, productivity and others.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants, including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over 85%.

    The proposed project turns supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling. Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new markets, such as wastewater treatment.  Recovery of compression energy during SCWO has been demonstrated previously.  This project's goals are to further optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours between major services.

    \ Phase I project is in comprehensively addressing issues related to water treatment,\
    \ environment protection, and resource recovery through the development of a new\
    \ desalination technology called a desalination battery. Steady growth in human\
    \ population and rapid industrial development have led to greater demands for\

    \ and energy generation to reduce the energy and costs associated with desalination,\
    \ addressing challenges at the intersection of the water-energy nexus. The goal\
    \ of the proposed research is to accelerate the commercialization of the desalination\
    \ battery by evaluating the effects of various solution components present in\
    \ real feedwater types on performance. The project will also establish mitigation\

    \ release of Na+ and Cl-. As the energy consumed during charging is recovered\
    \ during discharging, the net energy required for desalination is drastically\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing safe, cost-effective elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater in order to protect human health and the environment while reducing the cost and complexity of remediation. PFAS are some of the world’s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS pose a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. PFAS in groundwater cannot be broken down through traditional chemical processes; Hence, current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream where the efficacy and safety of disposal are still uncertain.  This project focuses on the development of a low cost, sustainable treatment method that eliminates PFAS with no secondary waste generation and no costly consumables.  This technology removes the liability and environmental and health risks associated with incomplete elimination and secondary waste disposal.

    The objective of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to develop a safe, chemical-free and low cost PFAS electrolyzer for groundwater remediation. The electrolyzer consists of a divided radial-field unit cell architecture with a de-polarized cathode and a high surface area and low-cost anode electrocatalyst material. The electrocatalyst is designed to provide direct oxidation at high voltage and the treatment process will mineralize PFAS in a single step, in minutes, with no breakdown byproducts or secondary waste. A scalable, single unit cell bench-top electrolyzer will be designed and built for treatability testing of PFAS-contaminated groundwater.  The anode electrocatalyst material composition will be optimized and coated onto high surface area substrates.  A de-polarized cathode will be developed to eliminate the catholyte loop and hydrogen generation, and lower energy consumption. The PFAS mineralization effectiveness will be measured as a function of operating parameters and water quality.  The electrocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism of the new anode material will be determined. Using the experimental results, the capital and operating cost of a groundwater remediation system will be estimated.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the development of an economically viable process that can help mitigate and reverse climate change by pulling carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and using it to make durable polymers used in items that surround us every day. There is increasing global pressure to end emissions-intensive, fossil fuel-based operations. However, society has a extensive infrastructure that uses hydrocarbon as fuels as well as in plastics and other polymers. The proposed system will be used to manufacture useful hydrocarbon materials using carbon dioxide captured from air and hydrogen split from water. This technology represents a new pathway for meeting global demand for hydrocarbons without relying on fossil fuels, which may result not only in reduced emissions but in a net draw-down of the “legacy CO2” in the atmosphere. This technology may create new jobs in the American economy, mostly outside the urban commercial centers.

    This SBIR project will develop a novel system that integrates CO2 direct air capture into a water electrolysis device so as to produce a stream of captured CO2 and green hydrogen (H2) from a single device with energy requirements not much higher than water electrolysis alone. The system relies on two primary innovations: 1) a water electrolysis process using a unique buffer solution and a novel reactor design that combines direct air contact with water electrolysis to simultaneously capture CO2 and produce H2 from water, and 2) a new hollow fiber membrane bioreactor that uses multiple layers of hydrogel-encapsulated organisms to convert the electrolysis reactor’s emissions into biogenic methane (also known as renewable natural gas or RNG), and eventually into more complex hydrocarbon molecules. The goal of this project is to optimize the performance of both the electrolysis reactor and the bioreactor in order to demonstrate an economically viable pathway for capturing ambient CO2 and “upcycling” it into RNG. While the initial upcycling target is RNG, the emissions from the electrolysis reactor are suitable for conversion into more complex hydrocarbons.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve data harnessing and real-time intelligent decision making. The proposed technology is a new reconfigurable computing platform capable of performing a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks in a distributed and parallel manner to deliver the best performance at a lower cost. The end products are AI accelerator chips that can be integrated in Accelerator Cards or as co-processors to be applied in both server and edge computing solutions to accelerate AI tasks. The general market need is particularly acute for data center and cloud computing industries where major pain points are performance bottlenecks and high costs due to custom chips or reliance on graphic processing units. The core value propositions of the proposed technology are faster compute, programmability at run-time, and easier integration with existing software to enable execution of popular machine learning frameworks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase I project centers around a novel computing approach where computing and memory elements are parallel and distributed, and interconnection between computing elements is flexible. The project develops an integrated circuit chip that can be reconfigured at run-time to behave as a custom application-specific integrated circuit for each running Artificial Intelligence (AI) application to deliver the optimal performance. It will overcome the memory bottleneck that traditional computing technologies face where data needs to be continuously loaded to and from memory.  The proposed technology also addresses the adaptivity challenge for evolving AI models and datasets. The proposed activities include a chip fabrication using a 28nm commercial semiconductor foundry process, extensive benchmarking of the new technology for scalability, adaptability to data size and shape, and research on a software interface to execute codes developed by existing machine learning frameworks in the new chip. The prototype chip is expected to demonstrate distributed and parallel computing capabilities along with dynamic reconfigurability.  The benchmarking work is anticipated to reveal at least an order of magnitude improvement over more conventional graphics processing unit based approaches.

    \ is a multi-step process involving chlorination of titanium dioxide (TiO2) to\
    \ form titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), the reduction of TiCl4 by magnesium (Mg).\
    \ The cost of Ti alloy ingot depends on the cost of Ti sponge and the melt-refining\
    \ (e.g., VAR) process. Typically, Ti sponge accounts for more than 70% of the\
    \ cost of Ti alloy ingot. The melt-refining process is also a significant cost\
    \ contributor because Ti alloy ingot has to be melted for two or more times to\

    \ Phase I project opens pathways to large-scale domestic manufacturing of low-cost\
    \ energy infrastructure needed to facilitate the clean energy transition in the\
    \ United States. The United States has a vast offshore wind energy resource that\
    \ is nearly four times the nation's current electricity use. This enormous potential\
    \ presents an opportunity to deliver clean and reliable electricity to the country’\
    s largest population centers while creating hundreds of thousands of jobs to manufacture\
    \ and service the wind plants. However, approximately 60% of the offshore wind\
    \ energy resource is in deep waters that require floating wind turbines moored\
    \ to seafloor anchors. With an installed cost of approximately $1 M each, lower-cost\
    \ anchor solutions are needed to accelerate the deployment of wind energy. This\
    \ Phase I project uses advanced additive manufacturing methods to cut the installed\
    \ costs of wind turbine anchors. The additive manufacturing technology also has\
    \ strong future market potential in diverse renewable energy technologies beyond\
    \ anchors, including fixed-bottom offshore substructures, floating wind platforms,\
    \ wave energy devices, on-shore wind turbine towers, small hydropower, and pumped\
    \ hydro electric energy storage.  This project combines four cost-reducing innovations\
    \ to create a low cost additively manufactured anchor that will cut installed\
    \ anchor costs by up to 80% compared to conventional steel suction anchors – saving\
    \ approximately $3M per floating wind turbine. \n\nThe proposed project advances\
    \ the following innovations: (1) the first-ever application of 3D concrete printing\
    \ to floating wind turbines, (2) an innovative concrete reinforcement system,\
    \ (3) integrated buoyancy chambers that aid transport and installation of the\
    \ anchor, and (4) a new mooring line connection method, the development of which\
    \ is the primary focus of the project.  The project goal is to pave the way for\
    \ the first-ever seafloor embedment of the innovative concrete anchor by de-risking\
    \ key aspects of a mooring line connection solution capable of resisting extreme\
    \ mooring line forces of approximately 1,700 metric tons. The Phase I project\
    \ scope includes comparison and down-selection of mooring line connection concepts,\
    \ preliminary design of the selected design, fabrication of a section of the concrete\
    \ anchor using additive manufacturing at a scale of up to 2.5 meters in diameter,\
    \ and analysis of the cost effectiveness and production rates of the innovative\
    \ anchor and additive manufacturing process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical care for patients requiring blood vessel grafts that are autologous, or come from the same patient.  In the United States,1.4 million patients need arterial replacements each year. Bypass graft surgeries and reconstructive surgeries often involve the replacement of diseased or damaged blood vessels with a graft of an artery or vein taken from another part of the body. These procedures are invasive and dangerous. In addition, using autologous grafts to reconstruct branched vessels in certain indications (e.g., in hand reconstruction surgeries or free-flap procedures) prolongs the surgery and may increase the risk of post-operative complications. The proposed technology allows for creation of engineered systems that can be used as grafts. More over, they can be used for pre-clinical testing of cardiovascular devices, limiting the need (and costs) associated with animal studies, as well as potentially other systems, such as the lung and trachea.

    This project advances a process to manufacture a system that follows the complex geometries and characteristics of native blood vessels. Current practice to create artificial blood vessel grafts is limited to simple shapes or systems with non-optimal mechanical/structural properties.  This project develops a new method for creation of nanofibrous vessels with complex geometries via 3D printing, creation of sacrificial collectors, and electrospinning. The first objective will be to develop nanofibrous vessel scaffolds with different geometries (cylindrical, bifurcated, and trifurcated) and diameters using sacrificial collectors and evaluate microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the vessels. The second objective will be to evaluate biocompatibility of the nanofibrous vessels by testing the viability, adhesion, and proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in teaching K-12 and college students STEM concepts in the fun-filled context of designing, building, and programming machines and robots and preparing them for the future technology-driven jobs. This project seeks to make robotics education affordable, equitable, and inclusive for students at all grade levels. By taking a multi-disciplinary and cross-curricula approach, the product developed through this project engages students, especially women and minorities from diverse backgrounds, effectively in STEM disciplines and helps them make suitable career choices. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce and help fill the 2.5 million STEM jobs that are vacant according to the current US Department of Labor Statistics. The technological innovations emerging from this project would result in a computational tool for synthesis of robot motions, which can be used broadly in industrial automation and invention of machines and robots. The proposed design-driven educational robotics product has the potential to improve engagement with science and technology and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to bring together rigid body kinematics, machine learning, and engineering design to create a new product for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools, freshman college programs, and STEM camps. The leading commercially available educational robotic systems emphasize 1) instruction-driven prototyping of robot structures using many specialized parts, and 2) programming them without providing any intuition behind the design process or guidance to creating mechanism design concepts for the realization of the motion of the robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, new science standards, and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This product would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. If successful, this project would result in a state-of-the-art motion design software, a novel hardware kit, and standards-aligned curriculum and learning resources for schools and colleges. The software based on the machine learning in mechanism design research will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide students necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    \ of detection, improving field testing for environmental contamination; detection\
    \ of toxins and pathogens in agriculture; and early disease identification in\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to secure Integrated Circuit (IC) Intellectual Property (IP) against untrusted parties in the globalized IC supply chain.  Outsourcing of IC foundries creates risks of IC reverse engineering, overproduction, theft, and even piracy. A promising method of achieving hardware IP security is by logically locking the functionality of a design by replacing a subset of the design components with programmable elements. The correct content of these elements forms the key for unlocking/activation of the design in a secure facility and/or via a secure protocol after manufacturing. A technical challenge in commercializing this technology is the long time period typically needed to assess the security of a locked design against state-of-the-art attack algorithms at the design phase. This project will address this technical challenge by developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted design security analyzer tool to instantaneously provide an accurate attack runtime estimation on a locked design, significantly reducing the design time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly shorten the time required to assess attack resiliency of an obfuscated (locked) Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Running the state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability solvers (SAT attack) on a state-of-the-art computer server to de-obfuscate a locked design can take time - ranging from days to months. Such a long security analysis time is prohibitive for deployment in the design process where iterative design optimizations are needed for making power, performance, area, and security (PPAS) trade-offs. This project aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel approach that will bring the security assessment time down to near zero using a machine-learning based model. Based on recent advancements in graph and geometric deep learning techniques, an innovative end-to-end security assessment framework is proposed that directly and losslessly ingests the original design as a graph-structured input, and then automatically learns the discriminative features that influence logic locking security. To support sufficient data for the proposed data-driven method, a logic locking macro-database will be developed that encompasses the required PPAS, attack and defense information.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide cruelty-free, safe and sustainable solutions to replace animal-sourced exotic leathers by leveraging new advances in biotechnology and additive manufacturing. The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of employing natural as well as synthetic components for the fabrication of exotic skins as a precursor raw material for further processing into consumer goods. Specifically, formulations composed of chemical building blocks of native animal skin will be designed, formulated, produced, and subsequently fabricated into composite leather mimics using advanced additive manufacturing platforms. If successful, the proposed efforts will lead to prototypes of engineered composite materials that reproduce the aesthetic, physical, mechanical, and performance properties of exotic leathers. Providing animal-free, sustainable, and environmentally friendly options to conventional exotic leathers can have a significant societal and environmental impact, while opening a new market and supporting growth in the leather processing and tanning industry.

    This project will replace conventional exotic leathers with alternatives that mimic the native structure and biochemical composition of exotic skins; recapitulate the mechanical and physical properties of the exotic leathers; and able to be manufactured using environmentally friendly, sustainable and xenofree technologies. Two critical technical challenges addressed as part of the proposed research will include engineering the architecture of exotic leathers in a bottoms-up approach by combining the relevant building blocks of exotic skins; and employing advanced manufacturing platforms to develop processes that are xenofree, sustainable and environmentally friendly. The research goal is to replicate the constituent collagen-based building blocks of the dermal matrix. Collagen fibrils of the dermal matrix are formed primarily by the triple-helix-forming polypeptide subdomains that can independently recreate the fibrillar self-assembled geometries seen with full-length collagen protein. The proposed work will use collagen and collagen-mimicking subdomains, along with other matrix molecules, to mimic the molecular and supramolecular self-assembly of fibrils in the dermal matrix to precisely control the diameter, density, and orientations of the constituent structures of leather.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to build a condition assessment and monitoring platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for intelligent decision support to expedite diagnosis and facilitate personalized therapy solutions. Currently, patient history data is obtained verbally, and poor health communication between clinician and patient potentially causes 78% of misdiagnoses, resulting in 80,000 avoidable hospital deaths and $750 billion in costs to the US economy each year. Language barriers exacerbate this situation significantly, increasing the risk of severe and frequent adverse outcomes by 49%. Patients with cultural, language, and low health literacy are twice as affected. The proposed work has three major technical objectives: (1) develop an interactive visually-supported healthcare data capture user interface (UI) to overcome communication and language barriers, (2) develop an AI-based risk assessment engine to communicate symptoms to the provider for triage decisions, and (3) leverage predictive analytics to recommend appropriate treatment options and develop a visualization-based condition monitoring and management tool.  The proposed data collection and AI-powered provider decision support platform will empower patients and providers by enhancing communication, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is designed for accessibility across all levels of literacy and is language-agnostic. The platform’s digitally-native, cloud-based approach allows it to be scalable for widespread impact and faster impact. The frontend app captures important patient information and symptoms before the patient exam and summarizes the patient self-report in an easily readable format for the clinician. The clinician will potentially be more prepared, facilitating the delivery of personalized care and improved outcomes by avoiding misdiagnosis, errors, and complications earlier in a patient’s journey. The AI-based model pulls structured data, such as demographic information and symptoms from the patient self-report, and the dataset undergoes supervised learning using historical, real-world outcomes data. Multiple AI models will be evaluated, including classification and neural network models, and those with sufficiently accurate performance will be considered as inputs for ensemble learning, the final prediction output for this project. Example outputs include patient evaluators such as consistencies within the patient’s self-report, an estimated risk assessment score, and an approximate diagnosis accuracy score.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to leverage architecture as a new tool for advancing health and wellbeing. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital architecture systemically affects patient health, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. However, architects often lack the tools to reliably predict how design choices will impact building operations.   Often hospitals and clinics designs fall short with building owners not able to achieve organizational metrics and goals, and patients can see poorer quality of care, increased medical errors, and even higher mortality rates.  The commercial impact will stem from a software platform that equips architects with no-code workflows necessary to deploy data-driven design while managing project timelines and internal costs. Although the Phase I project focuses on healthcare architecture, the broader impact will be that architects will be able to design all buildings to optimize health, productivity, and organizational goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of 1) algorithms that generate structured architectural data capturing spatial qualities that affect occupant health, 2) data visualization interfaces for exploring and validating spatial data and health data jointly, and 3) statistical and machine learning models for identifying meaningful relationships between architectural characteristics and health outcomes across large-scale datasets. These tools will be tested and evaluated by conducting a proof of concept study with a large health system. The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of untested statistical machine learning methods to identify meaningful relationships between architecture and health outcomes. The proposed research will provide new types of insight into architecture's role in affecting health outcomes, providing a novel approach to data-driven design. Though the focus of this proposal is on architectural data, the principles explored will push boundaries of current limits by 1) incorporating qualitative and quantitative data in machine learning models, 2) assessing new modes of interpretability via data visualization, and 3) advancing methods for working with sparse but rich datasets.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.

    The proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce opioid dependence.  A critical challenge in the use of opioids on a long-term basis is balancing benefit and risk, based on determining the optimal dosage to manage the associated risks against side effects.  Opioid tapers are used to manage this risk and may last from several weeks to several years. However, following the voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, many patients report improvements in function, sleep, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or even with decreased pain levels. Furthermore, tapers are typically used to manage opioid tolerance, hyperalgesia, enable more effective pain management prior to surgical procedures, or transition to another form of opioids or non-opioid pain medication.  Nearly 18 million Americans may benefit from an opioid taper to improve the long-term management of their chronic pain and improve the safety and effectiveness of chronic opioid therapy.  In particular, in rural communities, patients may not have access to pain specialists and rely on their primary care physicians for chronic pain management. The proposed technology provides a critical tool for opioid tapering to rural primary care physicians, where almost half of the opioids are prescribed. Using the clinical decision support tool, primary care physicians will have a virtual pain specialist advising of the anticipated predictive outcomes and actions to ensure a successful taper with direct feedback from the patient.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply machine learning techniques to develop algorithms using a dataset that describes successful and unsuccessful tapers with clinical data, medical decision making, patient experience, and physician /patient interaction and communication. The predictive model will inform the medical decision-maker of the likelihood of successive patient events and their impact on the taper outcome based on real-time data about the patient's physical, psychological, social, and emotional experience.  This innovation will be implemented on a smartphone platform to extend the physician / patient medical decision model beyond the clinical setting into the patient's environment. This will create a new model of a patient-centric taper wherein the estimated clinical outcomes and associated actions are informed by optimizing the patient experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance exploration and commercial development of the Moon and, eventually, solar system, by lowering the risk of damage to surface and orbital infrastructure from ejected lunar dust during rocket landings and launches. This activity is in the area of material processing/manufacturing in space, and focuses on the space infrastructure (civil works) market sector, similar to roads and airports on Earth. Creating a viable, cost-effective solution to mitigate lunar dust will lower the cost of accessing the lunar surface and accelerate the development of lunar surface infrastructure that is necessary for all aspects of sustainable commercial space development, including mining, manufacturing, construction, habitation, power generation, communications, and in particular, transportation. Facilitating lunar exploration will expand scientific knowledge of the solar system.  It will also enhance commercial development that will expand economic opportunities by opening new areas of the economy in space, with inevitable spin-off benefits for life on Earth. In the long term, the capacity to create new areas for habitation on the Moon and throughout the solar system will have profound impacts on human society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes building lunar landing pads to address the problem of surface dust ejected during rocket landings and launches, which can otherwise damage both nearby and distant infrastructure, including those structures located the other side of the Moon and in orbit. To minimize transport costs from Earth, surface infrastructure must be constructed from local materials as much as possible. Instead of using high-energy processes to harden regolith, this approach will bind it with a high-performance polymer created from lunar volatiles co-located with water-ice in polar regions. This solution reduces mass, cost, and technical risk by leveraging anticipated water-ice mining operations and utilizing discarded volatiles from their operations to produce high-quality polymers.  The approach may be sustainable, producing enough material annually to replace worn-out sections of landing pads. Phase I will focus on converting raw volatiles into polymer precursors, fabricating/testing candidate composite materials, and elaborating the concept of operations, through a combination of research, modeling, and laboratory experiments. Information gathered during Phase I will narrow the range of candidate polymers for further consideration, identifying chemical synthesis pathways for more extensive development, and highlighting areas of improvement to maximize commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the cognitive runtime capabilities of edge native Internet of Things (IoT) platform that offers significant gain in incremental operational intelligence, real-time monitoring, and autonomic functions. As the edge computing capabilities infiltrate into industrial IoT application domains to overcome the limitation of centralized computing (latency, bandwidth, and single point of failure), constrained hardware (compute and storage) resources, and data availability. The proposed technology may adjust with the changing cyber-physical environment, extend situational awareness, protect against cyber security threats, minimize the cost of scaling network and cloud infrastructures, and deliver extreme responsiveness within mission critical ecosystems such as smart grid surveillance, remote patient monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and defense weaponry systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research a cognitive internet-of-things (IoT) runtime that enhances process automation and analytical capabilities of edge native M2M/IoT solutions. The recent trends of edge computing have created service opportunities catering to real-time use cases closer to the operating environment. The most common predefined rule-based logic and structured intelligence on edge nodes fails to deliver scalability, autonomy, interoperability, and intelligent control operations. The artificial intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) models usually perform better on cloud or multiclause server infrastructure in a batch mode. This invention closes the existing gap and further advances the distributed edge computing capabilities by introducing Cognitive AI models that introduce semantic learning with incremental data from within embedded runtime and develop reasoning through interactions within the connected environment. The research and development on Per-to-Peer collaboration across the edge nodes overcomes the limitations of constrained resource and executes workflows. The runtime architecture simulates the human nervous system’s anatomical layers and systematic coordination of neuro-motor operations.  The proposed design patterns of analytical models and distributed intelligence will introduce a realistic implementation of smarter decision support systems on the edge that could adapt to ever changing operational contexts and introduce diverse intelligent operations through collaborative learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project stems from developing a wireless communications technology based on physical (PHY) layer rateless codes.  If successfully demonstrated, these codes could provide high data rates with low computational costs, minimum latency, and enhanced energy efficiency, i.e., long battery life. The initial target of the technological innovation is the space communications market - both commercial and government space programs. Space communication systems are a critical and integral part of every space mission. This Phase I project focuses on an enabling technology addressing capability gaps that could provide cheaper and faster solutions for the data communication systems. Commercialization of the proposed technology is beneficial to the US economy and government since the development of innovative technologies for the space sector contributes to economic growth in the emerging space economy. The proposed next-generation wireless communications technology may also support a wide variety of applications and use cases in the terrestrial wireless market. These application areas include 5G Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a PHY rateless codes-based novel adaptive transmission technology for the reliable transmission of information bits between a wireless transmitter and receiver. PHY rateless codes have the innate ability to adapt both the code construction and the number of code bits for an as-needed transmission of code bits. The adaptive transmission technology in the PHY layer interacts with the automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols in the data link layer (DLL) affecting its sequence of operations. The DLL designed for the traditional fixed-rate coding is a poor match for the PHY rateless system. A key goal of the proposed Phase I project is to design a simple and yet effective DLL for a proximity space link using PHY rateless codes which optimizes the throughput, establishing the technical feasibility. The Phase I project aims to add new design features to the PHY rateless encoder and decoder based on deep learning/auto encoder enhancements, structured permutations, and efficient algorithms/techniques for solving sparse linear systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on the development of a more secure computer infrastructure in the US, particularly for building automation systems, power systems, etc. Much of the current infrastructure runs on older computer architectures and the hardware suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed by upgrading the software.  This project seeks to allow ventors to find and fix hardware vulnerabilities more quickly and without constraints from intellectual property holders.  The project will allow un-modified Linux binaries to run as unikernels on the reduced instruction set of reduced instruction set computer-V (RISC-V) architecture. The RISC-V architecture is an open ISA (instruction set architecture) and allows for rapid innovation and broad adoption in the expanding edge and IoT (internet of things) space. Being able to deploy applications to RISC-V as unikernels versus ordinary Linux guests brings strong security, performance, and deployment benefits to the ecosystem.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project directly addresses performance, security, and deployment problems current edge and IoT projects. Current edge-based systems use operating systems that are multi-decades old, are hard to upgrade, and are targeted in cyberattacks worldwide. To enable advanced technology that requires edge compute such as machine learning applications to be safely deployed, the security concerns of the underlying operating system must be addressed. Unikernels are single process systems that can run programs on the same virtual machines with a heavily reduced attack surface. By applying unikernel technology to the RISC-V architecture, advanced technology can be more quickly deployed in a safer manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the uptime of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and similar robotic systems to nearly one hundred percent at factories and fulfillment centers to further improve productivity and reduce overhead costs. These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in the marketplace.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    \ allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising\
    \ incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free\

    \ (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their\
    \ families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting\
    \ food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination.\
    \ \n \nThe proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free\
    \ peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing\
    \ tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\
    \ and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after\

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improved food security, environmental benefits, and human health benefits.  This project will develop a meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meat.  The technology developed from the proposed project will be used to build a vertically integrated food manufacturing platform that can withstand supply chain disruptions from natural disasters and pandemics. These meat alternatives will reduce and replace traditional meat consumption, with many environmental benefits - lowered greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic pollution; lower use of energy, water and land; and reduced antibiotics usage. There are benefits to human health for reduced meat consumption. Furthermore, production costs will be eventually be comparable to that of mushroom farming.

    The proposed project aims to develop a fermentation-based meat alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of animal meal through recombinant protein technologies.  Additionally, the project aims to leverage the texture and flavor of mushroom mycelia, and supplement this with recombinant muscle proteins to further enhance the taste and nutritional profiles and overcome many of the shortcomings of existing plant-based meat products. To date the concept of combining recombinant muscle protein and single cell protein is novel and has not been reported. Large gaps persist between plant-based and lab-grown meat, with regards to cost and consumer experience. Plant-based meat is more affordable but faces consumer resistance due to sub-optimal texture and nutritional profiles, while cultivated meat offers a consumer experience similar to that of animal meat but at a much higher cost. Towards this goal, muscle protein genes will be expressed in a microbial host and enzymatically cross-linked with vegetable protein to produce protein fibers that can be formulated into synthetic meat. The technical objectives also include demonstration the feasibility of crosslinking muscle fiber proteins extracted from meat with mycoprotein from mushroom to produce desired textural and flavor properties.

    \ overall health and vigor of stored blood, including rare blood types, and extending\
    \ the shelf life of blood and platelets.  Donated blood begins to degrade on day\
    \ 11 and expires on day forty-two.  Platelets expire within 5-7 days of storage.\
    \  By increasing the shelf-life of healthy blood, the proposed technology decreases\
    \ waste and addresses the shortage of blood supplies around the world. The current\
    \ global blood shortage is 30 M units per year, and 18 M units of donated blood\
    \ are wasted due to expiration. Globally, 400 M people with rare blood types don't\
    \ have consistent access due to the cost of frozen rare blood.  Degradation in\
    \ red blood cells due to oxygen exposure and other factors begin as early as days\
    \ 11 - 21 after collection, impacting post-transfusion recovery by increasing\
    \ mortality, serious infections, multi-organ failure, thrombosis, and the length\

    \ Phase I project is to improve agricultural production. Of the global production\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address challenges of animal farming through cell-based meat production. Approximately 30% of the Earth’s surface, 70% of all arable land, and 29% of the global freshwater supply is dedicated to animal farming. Livestock is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major threat to biodiversity. 70% of all antibiotics used in the United States are used on farm animals and contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Cell-based meat development is estimated to generate significant reductions in greenhouse gases and use of land, water, and energy, as well as antibiotics in meat production. The proposed project aims to develop novel technologies that will accelerate cell-based meat development.

    The proposed project develops a novel scaffolding material for the generation of animal tissue, specifically skeletal muscle. The proposed project will ultimately advance current scientific knowledge on the mechanisms underlying tissue generation and elucidate the molecular principles governing cell adhesion, differentiation, and growth of animal cells during tissue development. Key technical objectives include demonstrating that the proposed scaffold can be successfully customized to harbor any cell adhesion molecule of interest, and proving that a novel biomaterial can be adapted as a tissue-culture-grade reagent. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to ascertain the extent of animal cell adhesion and growth on the proposed scaffold. These studies will advance understanding of animal cell interactions with their extracellular milieu, and how environmental molecular properties and cues are tuned to influence de novo tissue development in vitro.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is faster and accurate detection of Salmonella species in food processing plants. Salmonella bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of foodborne illness. Food contamination in processing facilities can lead to serious public health problems as well as costly recalls of millions of food units. Rapid and accurate sensing technology is currently lacking for definitive detection of Salmonella in food-processing plants, which delays initiation of appropriate control measures and increases the likelihood of spreading contamination and foodborne illnesses to consumers. This technology will enable more frequent testing throughout the entire manufacturing process at reduced costs. It is fully expected that this technology could be applied to the detection of other pathogens.

    The proposed project will create and test a rapid (20 minutes), hand-held, sensitive (1 bacteria cell per milliliter) platform to enable food-processing facilities to detect Salmonella on site. The innovation of this technology lies in the ability to avoid bacterial enrichment (22 to 48 hours to allow bacteria to grow), while still sensitively and selectively detecting Salmonella species. The device uses a testing cartridge to bring bacteria directly to a detection surface, which consists of graphene printed or scribed on a test-strip and subsequently functionalized with Salmonella-specific antibodies. Unique laser processing induces a 3D-structured surface at the nanoscale level in graphene that becomes highly conductive for biosensing and for antibody attachment, which are desirable properties for enabling low detection limits and increasing test sensitivity. These technologies can be combined into a portable platform to make a user-friendly handheld biosensor and displaying quantitative counts of bacteria. The integrated platform (test strip and cartridge) will be designed to interface with existing portable electrical readers in much the same fashion that diabetics monitor blood glucose levels at home with a blood test strip that connects to a portable reader with a digital display.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail items moving in and out of buildings.  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  This project will address these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The effort is focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase its effectiveness.  If successful, the project will address critical public health and safety challenges.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset.  No commercially viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One challenge is the detection of liquid or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame – such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device.  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate and improve the development and optimization of enzyme products.  This project will develop a platform that reduces costs and delays associated with research.  These enzyme products will improve the cost, safety, and sustainability in a range of applications, such as biomass processing, animal nutrition, solid and liquid waste management, household and industrial cleaners, and enzyme replacement therapies.  This solution will support the growth of the $10 billion enzyme market.

    The proposed project will advance a fluorescence-based enzyme activity-sensing platform, by reducing barriers to development of new industrial biocatalysts, enabling the rapid design of hydrolytic enzymes for industrial and specialty markets through the development of modular enzyme activity probes. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research and development are (1) determining performance metrics (limits of detection, speed, accuracy) relative to existing characterization techniques, (2) determining effects of sensor preparation methods on sensor performance, and (3) developing a robust reader for field use. The goals of the proposed research and development are to (1) provide parity data to current assays for end-users to engender confidence in our approach, (2) standardize production protocol, and (3) provide hand-held reader that is inexpensive (<$3000) and can withstand rough handling in field. At a high level, these goals will be achieved by (1) testing our sensors on a panel of candidate enzymes that have rigorous characterization already (to establish performance metrics), (2) using designed experiments to screen process space of sensor preparation and model effect on sensor performance attributes, and (3) using a design-build-test engineering framework to test reader components and layout.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines, scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.  This project advances a peptide production system.

    The proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure, novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and purification.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved sustainable food production. Mycotoxins are common contaminants found in cereal grains that can track through feed production and ultimately poison livestock animals. These poisoning events manifest as waste and inefficiency within human food supply chains. Animals consuming contaminated feed grow more slowly, produce less milk/eggs, are more susceptible to disease, etc. This equates to lost profits for the famers, lost meals for the consumer, and concerns over long-term food security. This SBIR Phase I project addresses this challenge through detection of these toxins. This technique offers a potentially transformative new tool in the field of point-of-source diagnostics, while simultaneously addressing the needs of the industry. This toxin detection system will be faster, simpler, and more versatile.

    The proposed project advances a new generation of mycotoxin detection technologies. This technique employs novel compounds designed to associate with a specific mycotoxin of interest to enable reliable quantitative detection. These detector compounds operate by changing the spectroscopic properties of the toxin, such that it can be detected even in complex biological mixtures like animal feed. The project investigates the extraction buffer composition and the detector compound design. The buffer and detector compound combinations will be optimized by characterizing the spectroscopic signatures under different excitation conditions.  This research program will target the two key classes of mycotoxins most relevant to industry.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.

    The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a novel non-toxic antifoulant that keeps the hulls of vessels clear of biofouling without the environmental harm imposed by today's current antifoulant products.  Biofouling is the accumulation of algae, barnacles, and other marine organisms on underwater surfaces such as the hulls of ships and boats.  A ship with a biofouled hull experiences drag, which slows it down and drives up fuel consumption by as much as 40%.  For the global shipping industry, this increase imposes an annual fuel cost penalty of $36 billion. Moreover, the excess fuel consumption due to biofouling adds 386 million tons of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.  Over 90% of antifoulants in the market today contain copper, a toxic biocide harmful to the marine ecosystem.  This project will develop a competitive antifoulant which avoids harmful environmental impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project develops a first-of-its-kind antifouling marine coating that is high-performing and safe for use in aquatic ecosystems.  This antifouling coating contains no biocides but delivers antifouling performance matching that of the market leading copper coatings. The novel coating consists of a hydrophilic polymeric material that is naturally antifouling.  It prevents biofouling by creating a liquid barrier around a surface which masks the surface from fouling marine organisms. While other hydrophilic coatings are notoriously unstable in aqueous environments, this innovation includes a method of application that helps to greatly increase the coating's stability and durability. The objectives of this Phase II project are to tune the formulation of the novel coating to meet marine end user performance requirements and regulatory benchmarks and to demonstrate small-batch production capabilities.  The outcome of this work will be a rigorously tested, ready high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution.

    \ commercial vehicles are a significant contributor to the nation's crumbling\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable advanced 3D printing materials to solve challenges in emerging electronic devices, transportation technologies, heating and cooling system for buildings, and in thermal management in manufacturing processes. Overheating is a major challenge as electrical devices continue to grow more compact and energy dense. Heat exchangers manufactured through traditional methods are often expensive and energy intensive to fabricate and suffer from corrosion, limited performance, and high maintenance costs. Traditional mold tools machined from metals are often expensive, require long lead times, and have limited design freedom. To address these challenges, this project will develop a platform of novel high thermal conductivity composite materials that can be used to 3D print parts that enhance electronics cooling and performance while also reducing the product weight and cost, can improve heat exchanger performance while also reducing corrosion, fouling and associated maintenance, and can also be used to 3D print low cost and high-performance molds with low-cost capital and short lead times. The project will result in an advanced materials platform for engineers to create parts with metal-like thermal conductivity, but with the speed, low cost, and ultimate design freedom of printing plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develops 3D printable, plastic composite materials with 500x higher thermal conductivity than standard plastics. The unique materials incorporate continuous wires and fibers in 3D printing filaments to achieve thermal conductivity values not possible in traditionally manufactured composite parts.  The polymer composite shell and wire/fiber core can be tailored to offer high strength, high temperature stability, and even joule heating. These materials are printed directly on commercially available and low-cost Independent Dual Extrusion (IDEX) 3D printers using a modified hardware and software platform. Printing and filament production will be accomplished through the following five objectives: 1) finalize filament formulations for the desired material properties, 2) establish a pilot scale filament manufacturing line to demonstrate production scalability, 3) complete minor 3D printer hardware modifications to accommodate filament printing, 4) develop software to print and optimize parts for desired properties, and 5) print application examples and validate product performance with commercially relevant demonstrations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve personnel safety from flammable gas leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential facilities. Additionally, the technology contributes to combating climate change by tackling one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.  The technology enables the mitigation of methane and refrigerant leaks that constitutes a significant market opportunity in the oil, gas and HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) markets. The innovation may solve important technical bottlenecks that have prevented widespread adoption of pervasive gas sensing in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As an enabling system, it may be utilized in a variety of other applications area such as the detection of explosives, narcotics, chemical weapons, indoor air quality monitoring, and diagnosis of disease via breath analysis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a gas sensor with an unparalleled combination of size, power, and cost while offering high detection performance. The proposed architecture fabricates high-frequency bulk acoustic resonators directly on the backend of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) integrated circuit chips which permits low-cost, mass-production and improved noise characteristics of the sensors. The direct co-integration also allows the fabrication of a receptor array to obtain responses from multiple target analytes that can be used to classify materials and for real-time calibration against environmental confounders. The objective of this project is the development of a single-chip gas sensor based on co-integrated piezoelectric materials. This effort will consist of the design, fabrication and characterization of integrated resonator arrays onto silicon circuits; integration of the chips with receptor materials, allowing selective adsorption of target gas molecules; and testing to assess the gas sensing performance.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the optics and lenses used in near infrared 3D imaging.  Glass lenses, which have excellent transmittance and thermal properties, are used in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and rangefinders for distances beyond a few tens of meters.  Polymer lenses, which are moldable and lower cost, are typically used in consumer-mobile 3D cameras and emerging automotive LiDAR systems.  The refractive indices of these lenses limit the numerical aperture and require longer-than-desired lens barrels.  The proposed polymeric chalcogenide lenses combine infrared transmittance, index, and thermal properties with the cost and moldability of optical polymers.  The innovation enables the molding of freeform polymer lenses with increased numerical aperture and reduced barrel lengths.  These properties make possible more compact, lighter, and lower cost 3D imagers.  With these advantages, rangefinders can be more easily carried and scan faster and smartphone cameras can have wider viewing angles.  Additionally, LiDAR systems can image more accurately around a vehicle and improve both driver and pedestrian safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance sulfur polymer chemistry and materials processing for the development of a new class of near infrared (NIR) optical components.  Innovative chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering has led to the development of a new class of optical polymers with the potential for imaging applications in the NIR.  As a result of extensive optical and mechanical characterization, including the determination of the optical constants over the full infrared spectrum, measurement of mechanical properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, measurement of thermo-optic coefficients, and determination of stress-optic coefficients, the materials will now be developed and integrated for product applications with innovative optical designs based on material's unique property set.  Freeform optical design concepts will be used which, to date, have not often been used in infrared imaging.  Such designs may lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for infrared imaging applications, further leveraging the advantages of the material's transmission spectrum, incorporating absorption, bulk scattering and surface scattering, and surface scattering contributions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat arthritis in joints. This project will advance the use of special materials for joint repair, which permit devices to mimic the naturally soft tissues of the body and provide anatomically correct support. These materials also offer the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, development of patient-specific devices. It will offer the ability to arthritis in joints in the foot, hand, knee (e.g. total knee replacement), spine (e.g. total disc replacement), and repair of any load-bearing orthopedic tissue, such as meniscus.

    The proposed project focuses on advancing the translation of Liquid-Crystalline Elastomers (LCE) as a cartilage replacement device for the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint to treat hallux rigidus. Hallux rigidus is a joint disorder at the base of the big toe. This project will be the first to investigate LCEs for orthopedic applications and develop an MTP joint repair using LCEs. LCEs have vastly superior energy dissipation properties relative to traditional elastomers, such as silicone or hydrogels. This project will demonstrate LCEs for treatment of degenerated joints by drawing from the disciplines of liquid-crystal elastomer science, viscoelasticity, and bioengineering. LCEs are known for behavior that is similar to biological tissues. This proposed project will accomplish: 1) synthesizing an LCE to mimic mechanical properties of natural joint to minimize wear rate under simulated physiological conditions; and 2) validation of biomechanical performance and biocompatibility of LCEs in comparison to the state of practice.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve research in the life sciences. This research often uses confocal and fluorescence imaging technologies to capture high-resolution, high-contrast images of biological samples. However, these methods traditionally require high levels of illuminating light, resulting in damage to tissues, disruption of normal processes like cell division, and competing with the light being measured in the experiment.  The proposed solution will improve the collection of light in these microscopes.  This will allow researchers to minimize damage to samples, thus removing current experimental constraints and enabling the development of new and far-ranging applications on an already powerful research platform. The proposed technology will be useful for disease and pharmaceutical research.

    The proposed project will involve the development of a simple, add-on, mirrored sample chamber unit capable of enhancing confocal microscopy capabilities by substantially increasing microscope fluorescence collection efficiency limits. This will require overcoming design challenges because the use of mirrors to collect and refocus emitted light has rarely been attempted in confocal microscopy. The proposed R&D work includes: 1) sample chamber and mirror design and prototyping, 2) design of mounting hardware and integration with an existing confocal system, and 3) exploration of compatible modalities, including Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy. Completion of the proposed objectives will lead to the development of a device that increases the light collection efficiency beyond the current 40% limit, is compatible with any detection objective, and does not require a separate optical path to the detector.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    \ Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related\
    \ deaths worldwide. HCC incidence has tripled since 1975 and increased incidence\
    \ in Western countries is expected due to its link with obesity and diabetes.\

    \ based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout\
    \ the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. This specificity\
    \ allows the use of proteins with a broad toxicity, reducing off-target side effects.\

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the care and quality of life of colon cancer patients while reducing healthcare costs. The development of a reliable, reversible, and cost-effective means to protect segments of bowel has potential applications to treating a number of common disease conditions such as colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease, and abdominal trauma. There are more than 120,000 temporary ostomies (surgical openings) performed each year in the US, and a majority of these can be eliminated with the development of the funded technology, addressing a $6.4 Billion total market opportunity. This funded device will initially target the over 40,000 individuals who have low bowel resections, the majority for rectal cancer. This represents an initial market size of $200 million in US. The overall impact with full market penetration in just the US rectal resection market is $2.4 billion in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of a novel technology to protect segments of bowel. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer with about 30-40% of cases involving the rectum. Rectal cancer is typically treated with surgical resection. However, anastomotic leaks can occur in up 10-18% of patients after resection, with an associated high mortality due to severe abdominal sepsis. Currently, diverting ostomies are typically placed above the anastomosis to mitigate the severe consequences of an anastomotic leak, but temporary ostomies themselves are highly morbid, have significant risk of mortality, are expensive to the healthcare system, and drastically impact patient’s quality of life. The funded technology is a medical device that provides temporary, minimally invasive protection of bowel during the healing process, avoiding the need for a diverting ostomy. This project will perform design verification testing, end user testing, and large animal validation testing required for human study approval. The goal of this project is to have a fully validated (both benchtop and animal testing completed), clinically ready medical device ready for further development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help patients with cardiorespiratory conditions, including sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia. The project will develop a wearable sensor platform to simultaneously diagnose and monitor conditions. Multiple physiological measurements are collected by a comfortable, wireless sensor patch, resulting in a convenient remote monitoring clinical framework. Interfacing sensor data with an efficient cloud-based provider portal and automated algorithms will enable rapid screening of the 24 million undiagnosed sleep apnea patients in the United States. The proposed innovation will also provide insight into the practical clinical benefits and efficiencies to be gained by bundling multiple comorbid or otherwise related diagnostic pathways into a single workflow, such as reducing time to treatment for comorbid atrial fibrillation. This remote monitoring bundle concept represents the only all-in-one device capable of servicing multiple highly pervasive health challenges in a method unobtrusive and user-friendly for both the patient and the provider - particularly for telemedicine applications made more urgent by the global pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a simple, accurate, cloud-connected wearable patch and collect clinical comparison data to develop automated, low-power algorithms to simultaneously detect sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, and cardiac arrhythmias. The project integrates materials science, mechanical engineering, and signal processing approaches to detect critical physiological signals from the torso, including oxygen saturation and several hemodynamic metrics. The project will also conduct studies that offer early insights into the clinical benefits of bundled workflows across cardiac and sleep medicine specialties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve drone control. Current controllers are effective in specific environments but perform poorly in environments and flight conditions such as turbulence, thereby narrowing the scope in which drones can be used.  This project will advance a plug-and-play solution in which users can focus on higher-level tasks specific to their use case, like obstacle avoidance and route planning. This new controller has broad applications in both commercial and military settings: it enables stable flight across a wide array of environments, expands the flight envelope in turbulent conditions, and allows for longer missions due to increased control efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of drone control in turbulence through the development of a reinforcement learning-based flight controller. The project will enlarge the design envelope for quadcopters as well as provide a system and environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to other control problems. Contemporary systems rely on Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controllers as an essential part of stable flight. These PID controllers rely on holistically tuned, static functions to convert maneuvering commands into voltage changes across drone motors to meet the rotor’s targeted rotation speed. In lieu of statically defined PID equations, this novel controller uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a subset of machine learning where an agent is trained to select actions that maximize a reward across an environment. This technique has led to greater-than-human performance across a variety of different control and game theory tasks, but little is known about how these techniques fare when replacing PID control systems. The primary advantage the development of a reinforcement learning controller would have over simpler PID controllers is the ability for the user to view drone control at a higher level of abstraction, thus mitigating the need to focus on the minutiae of flight control for complex missions.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include the ability to enhance the security and trust of critical infrastructure networks for applications including defense, electric grids, health care, and emerging autonomous systems (i.e., self-driving vehicles and robotics), as many of these systems are mission- and life-critical. The proposed innovation will allow distributed and autonomous systems the ability to make decisions based on highly trusted data sources. More importantly, the innovation addresses an immediate customer need to stop data breaches and prevent unauthorized activity on networks under flaky and uncertain conditions. The proposed innovation will enhance the practical applications of distributed computing fault tolerance and consensus mechanisms by applying them to real-world critical infrastructure networks. Mission-critical systems data are constantly under attack by adversaries at the rate of a billion times per year. For mission-critical systems, compromised data is a serious problem including huge economic losses, potential for mission failures, and in some situations, life-critical consequences. Protecting that data/information is one of the biggest market opportunities of this decade and the proposed work addresses the concerns of information assurance directly.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance an innovation that solves the complex problem of maintaining data integrity for mission-critical data within critical infrastructure networks.  The proposed innovation simplifies the extremely complex science of consensus and fault tolerance in distributed systems by combining flexible deployment of state-of-the-art Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT)consensus algorithms with the proposed novel file system innovation, creating highly useful solution to protect data integrity before it can be compromised under varying network operating conditions including asynchronous network conditions (byzantine and crash fault scenarios, ability to retain all transactions, provide liveness guarantees, maintain local node state integrity, and maintain data ordering and timestamps). The proposed file system solution is designed to be an easy to deploy software platform that keeps data safe, tamper-resistant, verifiable, and trusted over the system’s life cycle.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the enablement of verifiable and confidential computing through research and development that improves the performance and cost of the underlying cryptographic computations. Digital services play a foundational role in varied sectors including communication, education, banking, and others. Without cryptography these services would be impossible to conduct online in a secure and private manner. However, many new and more powerful cryptographic techniques remain out of reach due to their computationally expensive nature. Reducing the cost of these operations enables not just secure communication, but also verifiable and confidential computation, of rapidly growing interest to both the enterprise and government segments for use cases such as privacy-preserving machine learning. The market for verifiable and confidential computing solutions is expected to grow to over one billion dollars in the next five years.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and develop a high performance cloud-based system for verifiable and confidential computing. Currently many verifiable and confidential computing techniques can not be brought into production due to their computationally expensive nature. This project performs algorithmic research, hardware design, and software development, that will improve the performance and cost of these operations. In particular, this project optimizes cryptographic algorithms to make them more amenable to GPU-based processing, optimize the software implementation of those algorithms to target GPU architectures, devise methods for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and develop a scale-out architecture that dynamically scales capacity as the complexity of uses and number of users grow. With the appropriate design, the project expects to develop a system with over an order of magnitude or more performance than existing designs. Furthermore, by creating a ‘cloud-based’ infrastructure, these resources can be made available to developers around the world, with low latency and low cost. The expected improvements in performance, cost, and access will enable new use cases that have previously been impractical.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and networking.  Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers.  The proposed project enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum dot based multiwavelength laser sources.  Multiwavelength lasers with adequate output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion.  The designs and materials platform developed in this project address these challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the widespread adoption of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) by developing and commercializing a decentralized control and optimization platform capable of aggregating and managing millions of independent energy assets connected across the U.S. electric grid. The resulting end-to-end solution will enable private and public project developers, as well as utilities to quickly commission and cost effectively operate DER systems composed of solar arrays, batteries, generators, fuel cells and many other kinds of energy assets in residential, commercial, and industrial sites with complete confidence on the reliability, seamless grid integration, and economic performance of the systems. By making it that much easier and cheaper to own, integrate, and operate clean energy equipment, the resulting solution will transform the energy industry from the ground up, using DERs as the pillars of a new clean, resilient, and equitable grid.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will drastically simplify the way distributed energy resources (DER) systems are commissioned, aggregated, and operated. Such deployments are complex due to an endemic lack of standardization, the sheer number of key variables to control and optimize, and the lack of modularity in conventional approaches. Properly coordinating them as they continue to rapidly increase in number on the grid requires a decentralized approach that puts the decision-making at the DER level.  The project consists of two stages: (1) A development phase, where the algorithms will be integrated into a best-in-class solution, which will include all the necessary end-user facing tools, cloud infrastructure, and edge devices to enable full automation of deployments and satisfy technical requirements of customers in the mainstream market; and (2) a demonstration phase, where the resulting solution will be used at two different sites and benchmarked against critical use cases to validate its benefits and leverage the results to scale up market penetration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability power conversion systems (PCSs) while also reducing the complexity and cost. System builders and end-users of power electronics for PCS may benefit from proposed advancements in power semiconductor technology that are translated to cheaper and more resilient and sustainable electricity generation, distribution, and consumption. The interconnections of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems within DC (direct current) micro-grids and interfaces between DC micro-grids and legacy AC (alternating current) distribution grid networks will be made simpler, more efficient, and more reliable when the proposed power semiconductor devices become ubiquitous within future PCS.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve advanced power semiconductor processing techniques. Specifically, the project focuses on: 1) developing a reliable semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch in the form of a SiC MOSFET (Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), 2) optimizing the electronic switch parameters to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and reliability, and 3) fully characterizing the electrical performance of the electronic switch. The research will involve the design of experiments to determine the optimal set of electronic switch parameters that take into account manufacturing limitations of the semiconductor processing equipment. The teams seeks to produce a functioning semiconductor-based, high power electronic switch that is capable of operating more reliably and more efficiently than what is presently available in the market.  The team also seeks to enable even higher power electronic switches to be made by means of scaling the resultant SiC MOSFET technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of modular power sub-systems (power-stacks) that will enable a new generation of power inverters that are compact, re-usable, upgradable, resilient against die-supply shortages, and can be manufactured faster and cheaper. As the world migrates to sources of clean energy and the further electrification of industry, transportation, and homes, there is a significant and growing demand for electric power converters. Widespread adoption of clean energy requires that these converters be simple, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Today's designs are inconvenient both for end customers and for converter suppliers, as they typically are: complex, large, heavy, inflexible, expensive, and slow to market.  Current inverter are often made by only a few specialized companies and  have high technical barriers to entry for inexperienced entrants. Additionally, current inverters are locked to power-die suppliers, making scale-up and  re-use challenging. The proposed project will develop and test a novel approach to enable inverters to meet new market demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel approach to power conversion problems.  High speed operation of high-power semiconductor switches typically generates significant heat.  The novelty of the proposed innovation  over current technologies resides in moving the point of electrical isolation from adjacent to the power-die to adjacent to the coolant, and massively integrating the power path, the control path and thermal path into scalable building blocks.  An additional advantage is the ability to develop new manufacturing processes to build and integrate these blocks reliably. The outcomes of this project may be a design and manufacturing approach that results in 50% reduced development time and development cost, 80% lower weight and size, a $100-$200 per unit cost reduction, increased scalability, and improved resilience to die-supply shortages.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a sensor system for cell-based manufacturing of such products as biologic therapies, food ingredients, and bio-based materials. These sensors will overcome current limitations for tracking critical cell growth data, which requires manual sampling with slow turnaround times.  This system will enable better predictive growth models for improved production process development and will lead to better decision-making on cell type and culture conditions to produce biologic material. Better performance at this stage leads to potentially significant savings during the manufacturing lifetime of the drug.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a wireless sensor system to address the need of continuously monitoring viable cell density during biomanufacturing. Many industries use cells for production, but the initial focus is upstream development of cell therapies and biologics. Central to this development is tracking the growth of cells in a variety of small-scale, single-use bioreactors to determine key event points for feed and harvest. Current methods rely on infrequent sampling and off-line counting due to the volume required, risk of contamination, and cost. The central research objective is to develop methods for standardized sensor and reader fabrication and quality testing for calibration studies in commercially-relevant environments and systems.  The proposed project will develop: 1) sensor stickers that are applied to the exterior of culture vessels, 2) readers that interrogate the sensor, and 3) algorithms to convert the sensor signal to cell count and push notifications to operators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to reduce the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) while simultaneously improving their performance. In doing so, the project aims to accelerate the decarbonization of two of the largest sources of CO2 emissions: the energy and transportation sectors. To date, cost reductions in LIBs have been mostly driven by economies-of-scale, but these reductions are now reaching a plateau. To further drive down costs, this SBIR project will demonstrate a coating innovation that improves battery capacity and lifetime while eliminating certain costly and time-consuming bottlenecks that exist in current LIB manufacturing. The combined result of these enhancements will be a LIB with greatly reduced cost per kWh relative to the state of the art, ultimately enabling cost-competitive electric vehicles as well as widespread renewable energy storage.

    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on the application of protective thin-film coatings on LIB electrodes using a low-cost, easily integrated process. These coatings protect LIBs against degradation during charge and discharge, which extends battery lifetime, improves energy density, and enables next-generation electrode materials with greater capacity. This project will scale the company's coating technology as demonstrated during Phase I from lab-scale coating tools to a pilot “roll-to-roll” (R2R) coater that matches real-world LIB factory throughput, thereby de-risking integration of the coating process into standard LIB manufacturing lines. Phase II tasks will include optimization of process parameters to meet throughput targets, equipment design to ensure coating uniformity, and continued development of thin-film deposition chemistry to maximize cell performance improvements. By its conclusion, the Phase II project will demonstrate prototype LIBs with an anticipated >20% enhanced energy density as well as 30% reduced cost/kWh relative to the state of the art.

    \ weight reduction translates to reduced energy consumption, meaning better fuel\
    \ economy in combustion vehicles or improved electric vehicle range, both of which\
    \ reduce pollution. Weight reduction, enabled by lightweight composite materials,\
    \ is a significant component of automaker compliance strategy, as a 10% vehicle\
    \ weight reduction can achieve a 6-8% fuel economy improvement. \n\nThis Small\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a Personalized Text Simplification (PeTeS) technology to be used as a Computer Assisted Tool for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. Several automatic text simplification tools are available in the market. Unfortunately, the existing tools are one-size-fits-all solutions offering no personalization and not supporting the teacher’s instructional goals. The innovation of PeTeS is in the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification customizing texts for each student, enabling him/her to understand the curriculum and improve vocabulary knowledge at the same time. PeTeS will be compatible with both independent use by students and teacher-driven data-driven instruction. PeTeS will be usable both in class and in remote education settings, which is a new critical demand in our schools caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this Phase II Project is to fully develop the PeTeS product and evaluate its effectiveness in classroom and remote education settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project based on this SBIR sensor solution, with its high quality and low cost, will enable the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) industry to accelerate the progress to greater functionality of assisted driving, ultimately reaching full autonomy. The subject focal plane array (FPAS) chips may reduce the current US 36,560 annual vehicles deaths (the leading cause of death for those 1-54 years old) as well as reduce the 4.4 million injuries requiring medical attention and the $ 871 billion in damages and health costs. Additionally, improved assisted driving will enhance the mobility of seniors/disabled. Finally, the technology may reduce the societal carbon footprint by reducing congestion as a result of more fuel-efficient acceleration and braking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve the current ADAS sensor suite to increase safety. Current ADAS systems require many different sensor technologies to be implemented simultaneously. These sensors are insufficient to achieve higher levels of autonomy limiting the vehicle’s used in poor conditions. The proposed sensor solution will function in low light and harsh weather conditions with high performance. The added sensor functionalities will reduce the processor bandwidth required to integrate and analyze sensor data and detect road hazards, increasing the accuracy of the system. Overall, this improvement in performance may increase the overall safety in ADAS vehicles. An evaluation system will be developed to characterize the sensor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a robotic solution to automate a dangerous and repetitive rebar tying task in construction. Rebar tying is performed by “rodbusters”, 88% of whom reported that they suffered some form of musculoskeleton disorder during their career. Removing the repetitive bending over and tying actions can have significant impacts on the quality life of the workers who commonly suffer from carpal tunnel complications and back injuries. The market for rebar tying services solely for bridge decks in the US is valued at over $370 million across the next ten years. The general construction market is estimated to spend at least $1.3 billion annually for rebar tying. A quality transportation infrastructure has direct impacts on national defense readiness, economic competitiveness, disaster response, exchange of goods, and standards of living. However, at present, the US has a growing backlog of bridges deemed deficient. A successful Phase II project may play a key role in addressing the infrastructure maintenance backlog and allowing a key foundation of the national economic engine to function properly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate multiple robots to perform automated rebar tying. Many construction projects have thousands of rebar intersections that need to be tied; A system to detect these intersections is proposed. Various algorithms for detecting rebar will be improved and integrated to build a semi-automated rebar map building software. The research project will build an aircraft configuration and develop various computer vision and controls algorithms to demonstrate that a drone can fly over placed rebar, identify the intersections to tie, land on top of them and tie the rebar together. A small swarm of the customized drone prototypes will be built for demonstration. Speed in executing the job is critical for most construction projects implying that each intersection has to be tied in a matter of seconds for viable adoption of the proposed technology. The success of this project may result in the first commercially-viable swarm of mobile manipulation robots for unstructured environments.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new rapidly dry-sanitizing technology for disposable single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) and other articles in a manner that preserves material integrity and function to enable multiuse during pandemic and post-pandemic times. It will promote energy and water conservation, and reduce plastic waste significantly. This ozone-based sanitization technology will benefit all frontline workers regularly exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The need for rapid sterilization technology is likely to grow to mitigate social distancing configurations. Schools, daycare centers, health and fitness facilities, factories, and airports will need to implement sterilization protocols. With this technology, clothes, face shields and masks, phones, smart devices, and all manner of personal articles can be easily sanitized in less than ten minutes. The market for small industrial-scale waterless appliances with the capacity to offer on-demand sterilization may also expand rapidly. While ozone is used in a wide range of sterilization technologies, there is currently no consumer-friendly dry washing machine.  Thus, this project may also support development of an eco-friendly and effective laundry solution. Together, the sanitization and safety tasks will advance this technology as a viable waterless sanitization device, with the distinct advantage of lower cost, compact size, operational ease, and accessibility.

    The proposed project advances translation of a low-cost, rapidly deployable gas-based field sanitizer that does not require water, solvents, or detergents. To combat infectious viruses and odor-causing bacteria, this technology must meet aggressive benchmarks set by federal regulatory agencies for ozone emissions while achieving the highest bioburden reduction levels short of an autoclave. This project will optimize the ozone dose (ppm and time of exposure) required for viral inactivation and testing mask fit and filtration efficiency after repeated exposure to high ozone concentrations. The device will also incorporate new containment and neutralization technologies to meet environmental safety requirements. The device performance will be characterized by monitoring the exhaust for residual ozone during and after operation.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project relates to the unmet need for new and effective therapeutics that target the lung. This proposal outlines a novel treatment for the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19; however, this technology will also find use in other acute pulmonary disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Currently the options for treatment of pulmonary disorders include supplemental oxygen, ventilators, or nitrous oxide (NO) gas, which is toxic and cumbersome to use. Current technology uses gaseous NO which is a toxic gas supplied in high pressure tanks and is present only when inhaling the gas. The proposed project will develop a long-lasting, inhaled NO delivery system to improve lung function of patients suffering from ARDS brought on by COVID-19 or other causes.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances translation of a novel molecule which sequesters NO chemically as a stable solid and can be engineered to degrade at a controlled rate for in situ continuous release. This proposal develops NO donors with optimized performance and stability for pulmonary delivery.  Tasks include: develop and test libraries of NO donor compounds for the ability and rate of NO release; evaluate and select compounds with good solubility characteristics to formulate for aerosolization/ nebulization; test candidates for improvement of lung function in animal models.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve care for pulmonary conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This disease affects 30 million Americans, kills more than 150,000 a year and is the third leading cause of U.S. deaths. COPD costs Americans nearly $72 billion a year, half of which is spent on ER visits and hospital stays resulting from respiratory crises. Hospitalized COPD patients have reduced quality of life, more rapid lung disease progression, and a 50% increase in mortality in the subsequent two years. Currently, ongoing monitoring of COPD lung deterioration relies largely on patient-reported symptoms and inadequate tools (65-70% accurate). As a result, half of COPD deterioration remains undetected. The proposed technology facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of COPD attacks by continuous remote tracking of lung function, thereby preventing unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. This device improves care for long-term conditions like COPD or asthma, but also those with relatively quick onset, such as COVID-19.

    The proposed project advances translation of a device using acoustic resonance to measure lung air volume. The project develops an expanded data set for analysis and deployment at scale. The project further incorporates advanced classification models into the analysis workflow to track and predict deteriorating lung function in a cloud-computing environment. The project will also develop a version to run on a patient's mobile device to enable real-time feedback.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is a cost-effective way to manage and track viral outbreaks in animal, human, and plant populations, including tracking for situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.  It overcomes the challenges of current viral screening methods, namely PPE required for collecting samples, handling of samples to centralized analytic sites, cost of tests, and reliance on limited reagents.  The platform proposed in this project could be used on-site at an animal production facility or at home. The scanner can be placed at many municipal and commercial locations (e.g., drug stores) or the envelope can be conveniently mailed for assessment. The dual read modality gives timely feedback to the client, as well as the capability for anonymous aggregation of readout data - essential for real-time tracking of viral outbreak and informing resource allocation to mitigate spread. This diagnostic platform would generate impact, allowing: 1) animal producers to mitigate virus spread and reduce loss and 2) businesses, schools, and other organizations to make real-time data-driven decisions on closures and health policies.

    The proposed project focuses on assessing technical feasibility of three critical elements of a diagnostic platform: (1) the ability to couple isothermal RNA amplification directly to cell-free extract using custom formulations, to simplify usability (eliminate current off-card amplification with commercial kits) and reduce cost; (2) Production of a scalable and efficient cell-free extract well-suited for amplification of reporter proteins by RNA circuits to increase the rate of protein production and reduced RNA degradation.  The performance of this extract will inform the time to result as well as the cost of card, necessary metrics for translation; and (3) production of new toehold riboregulators (2 to 3) selective to virus targets relevant to the animal industry (e.g., swine flu, porcine respiratory).  These will also inform the limits of detection.  This project will evaluate the feasibility of such as system.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an easily distributed and adopted approach to find cells used to manufacture antibodies. Many of the antibodies used today for diagnostics and therapies are produced using cell lines. Selection of the cells that produce the most antibodies in a stable manner is required to bring new diagnostic and therapeutic products to market faster and with lower costs. However, the tools and approaches used to identify and pick cells today are extremely slow and/or expensive, often requiring costly custom equipment. The goal of this project is to develop a product that enables a user to identify individual cells that produce the most antibodies with equipment already present in their labs. This would enable more small pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and research labs to develop stable cell lines for antibody production and could have immediate impact in enabling distributed development and production of antibodies during pandemics, such as COVID-19.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a reagent-based workflow to perform single-cell antibody secretion assays that is user-friendly and easily distributed. The ability to analyze and select out single cells based on secretions is critical for the rapid development of monoclonal antibody therapies. A key challenge is the screening of producer cell lines for productivity, which can take months and require significant time and effort. Existing systems that try and address this problem require specialized expertise or commercial equipment that is not widely available, so the number of cells that can be analyzed remains small.  This project focuses on developing a microparticle, reagent-based product that can isolate single cells, concentrate and analyze their secreted products, and sort individual cells based on secretions in high-throughput using standard flow cytometers. The key technical objectives of this project are to: develop microparticle product formulations optimal for standard cells used to produce high quantities of antibodies, compare the system performance to current approaches, and use the system to create a cell line producing high amounts of a potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a technology to support social-emotional health by fostering co-presence, defined as a sense of being together in a virtual environment analogous to person-to-person physical interaction. Loneliness can be debilitating and have detrimental impact on patients aged 65 and over, causing an estimated $7 billion in Medicare costs associated with the effects of morbidity and mortality factors, such as dementia, heart disease, stroke, and depression. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the challenges and opportunities of digital tools in fostering connections associated with mental and physical health. The proposed virtual reality solution and the emerging digital therapeutics sector can address significant challenges faced by hospitals, assisted living care facilities, and mental health facilities, improving clinical outcomes.  The findings of this project are expected to impact other human interaction contexts, such as training, education, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances translation of digital therapeutic tools to foster co-presence.  The project compares physiological and psychological markers between pairs of individuals in both real and virtual contexts in search of significant markers for co-presence. Objectives include development of a custom virtual reality application and collection of quantitative data on pairs of individuals interacting in three social contexts. Proposed research will evaluate the degree to which virtual reality fosters co-presence and focus on specific algorithms and design choices as significant drivers of co-presence.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.

    \ 1) engineer pluripotent cells to produce exosomes with enhanced neuronal specificity\
    \ by transducing cells with the XStamp-BHP1 and XStamp-NCAM lentiviral vectors;\
    \ 2) grow pluripotent cells at scale using the mTesr3D system; 3) induce cells\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of a patient-friendly and cost-effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection arising from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The inability to quickly stop the spread of respiratory infectious pathogens can have devastating global consequences, resulting in millions of deaths and creating an enormous economic burden. This project will prove the viability of an aerosolized pan-coronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. An inhalable therapeutic has a stronger commercial potential than the currently approved monoclonal antibodies which require intravenous delivery, and this drug will be more likely to retain potency against future variants. The COVID-19 virus is expected to persist in the human population, and novel variants thereof will continue to emerge. Therefore, this technology could be crucial in addressing these ongoing medical needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of an inhalable decoy receptor that would effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its endogenous cellular target and thus prevent infection of the host. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. The decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface. Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the state-of-the-art for detecting, prioritizing, and responding to misinformation online. As more platforms are moving to end-to-end encryption, it is critical that new tools and algorithms are developed to respond to misinformation on these platforms. Encryption on platforms such as WhatsApp, Viber, LINE, Telegram, and Signal protects the communications of millions of Americans but also potentially allows rumors, misinformation, disinformation, and other threats to spread. This project builds ‘misinformation tiplines’: online accounts that allow users to check potential misinformation with leading fact-checking organizations. The proposed algorithms will allow Americans to check potential misinformation with fact-checking organizations allowing them to identify dangerous—and for health misinformation sometimes life-threatening—misinformation online. The project empowers users of online communication platforms and improves their safety while maintaining the benefits of end-to-end encryption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will overcome key challenges in order to allow tiplines to scale efficiently to millions of users. Tiplines require a thoughtful combination of artificial intelligence and human knowledge. The same misleading claims are often repeated and restated in many different ways online. In order for tiplines to scale, it is necessary to identify the claims being made in messages submitted to tiplines and match them against the extensive library of existing fact-checks. Claims can be in the form of text, image, video, or audio messages and expressed in many different human languages. In this project the company is building the algorithms needed to match these claims across languages and across formats. The results break new ground in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide new tools to evaluate and enhance teaching of higher-order critical thinking.  This project will leverage advanced machine learning models to generate critical-thinking questions for any text a student reads, analyze their written response, give them immediate feedback on how to refine their thinking, and ultimately provide data-driven insights to their teachers. The capability to automatically interpret open-ended responses using artificial intelligence (AI) is a rich area for the educational community.  This project will deepen the education community's knowledge in this area and apply the findings to K-12 education. In particular, the results may lead to a new evaluation architecture relying less on multiple-choice questions and related techniques, enhancing education with a method to efficiently evaluate and provide feedback with open-ended and short-response questions. This project will address the problem of using multiple-choice assessments to assess ‘learning’ and move to more accurate ways to ascertain the nuances of learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on automated short-answer scoring to solve a pressing and largely unsolved problem. Most work in automated scoring focuses on longer essay grading, which is more relevant for higher education. At this time, there are no general-purpose algorithms available for short responses. Adding to the technical complexity is the fact that this project’s machine learning approach needs to work for any book or text, and include questions written by any user. This project will improve the accuracy and detail of assessments, particularly with written responses regarding texts new to the reader. This project will require deep-learning natural language processing (NLP) technology to fully model language representation. The proposed system will ingest the subject text and the associated question before evaluating the written response without prior submissions used as training data. The project prototype will be developed for English Language Arts instruction prior to broader deployment across other disciplines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical outcomes for patients needing valves for vascular (veins) or urinary systems.  It is difficult to make artificial versions of the fluid control elements, such as valves, that are biocompatible and withstand the physical forces associated with their function, as well as the changing environment associated with aging. The proposed project advances a system to make artificial sutureless devices.

    The proposed project will optimize the materials and variables of manufacturing a polymer valve integrated with durable polymer encapsulation of a structural Nitinol frame. This Nitinol-polymer structure must withstand long-term challenging in vivo conditions while maintaining a physical interface that does not experience premature delamination and loss of device functionality. Polyurethane materials have excellent mechanical properties for rigorous applications and history of use in implants. This project explores the phase space of relevant parameters for manufacturing and deployment of these valves at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as expanded polystyrene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will be to address the customized needs of automotive applications with tailored high performance-low cost carbon fiber (HP-LCCF) products that are not currently commercially available. The broader impact of HP-LCCF technology is to enable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies to help mitigate the climate change linked emissions caused by fossil fuel powered vehicles.  Volume projections of HP-LCCF for this application are expected to ramp up significantly over the ten years.  After successful entry into the automotive market, the focus will be expanded to address needs in the wind energy market and with a tailored HP-LCCF product to enable longer blades for larger and more efficient wind turbines.  This technology will help spur global adoption of clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a process where heavy tow carbon fiber is subdivided using an electromechanical splitting process that can maintain an acceptable range of regular tow carbon fiber linear densities.  Subsequent tailoring trials will verify the capability to achieve and maintain the linear density targets provided by the automotive industry partners who will, in turn, perform downstream manufacturability trials.  Subdividing the heavy tows enables a seamless commercial entry into customers' downstream composite manufacturing processes without an inherent, potentially fatal heavy tow defect.  Such defects are typically non-uniform intra-band tension caused by the transverse catenary forces across the tow band.  Achieving high band linear density and variable intra-band tension are significant barriers for the commercial adoption of heavy tow high performance, low cost carbon fibers (HP-LCCF).  The process developed here may eliminate such issues and achieve commercially relevant HP-LCCF.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to detect social-emotional issues in children (ages 5-12) for early intervention. A growing trend in juvenile mental health concerns was exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruption in child development. This project proposes a machine learning (ML) system that learns from interactions with the child and parent independently and can detect potential social-emotional concerns.  The ML system enables personalized evaluation and monitoring outside a clinical setting in a remote or hybrid context.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances algorithms for integration into a social-emotional skill building curriculum.  The project proposes: 1) User segmentation based on a comprehensive assessment of social-emotional functioning, 2) Correlation of the relevancy and effectiveness of modules to segmented users, and 3) Collection of information to identify social emotional deficits (red flags). These activities enable a feedback loop to learn and deliver recommendations for each child-parent dyad, personalizing learning in real-time. These algorithms learn from behavioral, social, and emotional inputs from both the parent and child when they engage with the technology. The system will also detect red flags correlated with social and emotional deficits, promoting early intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by developing novel air pollution analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others.

    The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new method to distribute “last mile” fiber optic communication lines. Existing fiber installation methods like trenching require extensive approvals and are labor-intensive, disruptive, and cost-prohibitive, especially in underserved or remote areas. “Last mile” fiber is the most expensive part of any installation with a market valued at over $50 billion. This solution enables a quick, low-cost deployment of optical fiber directly onto pavement without cutting into the surface, effectively turning a barrier into a pathway. This new method will enable ubiquitous fiber optic connectivity and will expand the reach of fiber optic networks through the “last mile”. By lowering fiber deployment costs and improving efficiency, this technology will accelerate the rollout of 5G, enable smart city growth, and deliver broadband access to rural areas. This solution extends the benefits of fast communications to previously inaccessible locations, connecting businesses, homes, hospitals, and schools,  providing access to information, knowledge, and opportunity for everyone.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to validate a new fiber installation method leveraging existing road networks. Using pavement as the base, low-profile fiber cables are bonded to the surface and protected against traffic and weather by layers of durable coatings. Fiber links can be installed quickly on-demand with an installation machine that requires no digging and minimal disruption. The research objectives of this project are to build and test three prototype machines in the field and to iterate on design.  The research includes using the machines to install fiber, test pavement transitions, and compare costs and speed against other installation techniques. The anticipated technical results will expand understanding of machine utility, improve the user interface, verify the suitability, and validate economics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance new real-time tracking technologies that increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of container shipping across the world.  The container shipping industry underpins the modern supply chain and represents a $1.5 B market.  The proposed solution introduces 5G internet-of-things to tracking in worldwide shipping by demonstrating performance in the dirty, complex, and highly-cluttered environments of repair facilities and terminals crowded with container stacks.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be the continued exploration of backscattered mm-wave radio frequency identification (RFIDs)   for localization and communication.  In addition, although hardware and standards used for standard ultra-high frequency RFID-based localization systems have benefited from decades of improvements, methods appropriate for higher-frequency methods are virtually unexplored and feature radically different challenges. This effort will advance the tag and reader hardware and software, followed by optimization of the standard for the concurrent localization and communications with mm-wave backscatter tags. Finally, the project will conduct verification and validation of the mm-RFID system's mechanical and functional performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However, operating in today’s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application.  This project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively.  The technology represents a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete colonoscopies.  The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective, manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure realm.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to lower costs for injection molding, a common method of manufacturing plastic goods. Unfortunately, injection molding can be a lengthy and wasteful process because molds are designed, machined from metal, and then shipped to an injection molder. The proposed project will develop new tooling for low-volume injection molding applications at strengths and resolutions comparable with machined aluminum at a fraction of the current cost and lead time, providing extra resilience to the supply chain.  This will be used for applications in industries across automotive, aerospace, consumer product goods, and medical devices.

    This Phase II SBIR will apply advancements in 3D printing of fiber-reinforced photopolymers to the injection molding application.  This project will apply advancements in fiber-filled photopolymers (such as ceramic and polymer particle reinforced resins) in combination with magnetically aligned structures to injection mold tools. Tooling inserts will be tested across the most common and challenging injection molding plastics.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a life-saving treatment option to patients suffering from a specific heart condition called tricuspid regurgitation (TR). In the US, 1.6 million patients need treatment for life-threatening TR, and no good medical, surgical, or transcatheter therapy exists. Current solutions lead to bleeding complications, damage to the circulatory system, or inability to deliver the device. This project will develop a novel device to address these constraints with a method that can be manufactured at scale, resulting in significant cost savings to the healthcare system and improved quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will enable the development of a new transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device and novel technology to produce 3D physical vapor deposition (PVD) nitinol thin-film leaflets. One of the main challenges in valve development is a design that can be compressed into a catheter successfully. The use of a thin film rather than the standard of pericardial tissue will significantly reduce the volume of the valve material, enabling a much smaller delivery catheter profile. This study addresses critical developmental objectives, such as manufacturing feasibility and thin film leaflet characteristics. The solution will be optimized for material fatigue life, valve characteristics, valve durability, and anchoring to validate it for medical use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is translation of a novel, non-invasive monitor for fetal health during labor and delivery that will improve care and reduce cost. Currently, clinicians rely on monitor technologies that are subjective, unreliable and have high false positive rates for detecting the fetus at risk of hypoxia (fetal distress), resulting in high rates of medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries. When medically unnecessary, intervention by cesarean delivery incurs avoidable healthcare cost, unwarranted maternal risk and adverse consequences for newborns. Further, misdiagnosis of fetal health with current technologies results in costly medical negligence litigation. Fetal pulse oximetry would be applicable to over 3 million births per year in the United States alone.  This project will advance a new technology to measure oxygen in the fetus's pulse, creating a new method to ensure health of mother and child during delivery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a new safe, non-invasive, reflectance-based optical method for transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry. This method detects the fetal signal at the surface of the maternal abdomen and extracts it from the combined maternal-fetal signal. This project will conduct verification and validation tests to integrate signal processing, biophotonics, and pulse oximetry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in the negative effects of laparoscopies, procedures to enter the abdomen through a small incision.  Over 15 million laparoscopies are performed worldwide each year, particularly gynecologists, who represent roughly half the surgeons performing these procedures in the U.S. The proposed procedure does not require surgeons to alter their surgical techniques and requires minimal training. It uses equipment already in the hospital. The benefits will include better surgical outcomes, decreased patient post-op pain, and increased surgeon and patient satisfaction.  Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp and less invasively than perforating towel clips.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will help scientists gain a better\
    \ understanding of the underlying relationships in their data and as a result\
    \ help humans make better decisions from data. The advantage of big data is that\
    \ it allows for the possibility of identifying truly meaningful relationships.\
    \ Exposing these relationships can provide great benefits for many different problem\
    \ domains, and therefore has high commercial appeal in applications such as fraud\
    \ detection in credit card or insurance data, drug discovery, and identifying\
    \ threats to national security in homeland security data. Identifying previously\
    \ unseen relationships also plays a big part in scientific research and discovery.\
    \ Great scientific discoveries come from a deep understanding of the world around\
    \ us. Data can capture these relationships, but this is only useful if a researcher\
    \ can identify them. This motivates the need for sophisticated tools that can\
    \ present these relationships in a comprehensible way. \n\nThis Small Business\
    \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the problem of mining\
    \ and visualizing very high dimensional and time varying data sets. Modern data\
    \ sets can have many thousands of attributes which can introduce a significant\
    \ amount of noise and conflicting relationships. This problem is compounded in\
    \ time varying datasets as some relationships can be inconsistent and disappear\

    \ use causal analysis and also extend it to the temporal domain in which causes\
    \ with delayed effects will be identified (e.g. smoking causes cancer after many\
    \ decades). Finally, as these data mining techniques can be very computationally\
    \ expensive, this Phase II project will develop useful optimizations to make them\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from improved financial resilience of hundreds of thousands of water-dependent businesses and municipalities currently threatened by hydrologic volatility and severely strained ecosystems. This SBIR research will enable the seamless integration of scientific and financial modeling for the water economy. The innovation lowers the costs and improves the performance of two climate risk mitigation investments: 1) Green Infrastructure (projects that emulate or protect nature in order to ensure clean water supply for commercial and public use); and 2) weather insurance contracts, which provide businesses and utilities with financial relief from droughts and floods that hamper their operations. With 50% of the global population projected to face water scarcity by 2050 (according to the UN), and $10B in economic value destroyed annually by floods, droughts, freezes in the US, these new approaches to risk mitigation are crucial to reducing water demand stresses through a free-market approach to water resource conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to eliminate technical barriers currently hindering seamless data and model integration for hydrology and finance. The Phase I project validated technical feasibility by demonstrating the utility of a semantic web technology to provide end-to-end modeling solutions for quantifying hydro-financial risk. Phase I established that the technology 1) greatly improves the interoperability between massive heterogeneous data sets and models for quantifying hydrologic-financial risk, and 2) enables data and models to be linked through a tamper-proof distributed network. The Phase II project builds on the technological foundation to deploy a production environment for running a suite of models encompassing ecosystem services, hydrology, and actuarial sciences. The project builds foundations for AI-enabled decision support tools. If successful, this research will enable significant reductions in the time and costs associated with modeling the financial value of investment in natural water infrastructure, generating comparisons between a wide range of water projects and financial structures seamlessly and without compromising scientific rigor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the ability for developers to build massively collaborative and real-time cooperative video/virtual reality applications without compromising end-end security. Lack of end-to-end encryption has been a growing problem for consumers, educational institutions and businesses collaborating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will advance the state-of-the-art by providing developers with the necessary tools to create high quality synchronous collaborative virtual environments where children, teachers, corporate professionals and even national security personnel can safely engage in work-activity without risks of privacy loss or security/data compromises. This will also benefit telemedicine where privacy is paramount from a personal perspective and also from a legal standpoint. The success of demonstrating end-end encryption for a high-performance application will result in other remote-work collaborative tools being designed with end-end security as a key feature.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project solves the problem of maintaining end-end security of content while allowing expressivity using a scripting language by separating the data plane from the control plane for such massively collaborative multimedia applications. The control plane can be programmed using a web-friendly language that can be executed on any existing user-device such as laptops/smartphones thus giving maximum portability to the app developers. The data plane always stays end-end encrypted and can be manipulated using the scripting language in a highly expressive manner. The system provides perfect forward and backward secrecy by using a fast-group rekeying protocol to maintain confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the multimedia content. Research and development on this project will lead to breakthroughs in multiple avenues including the demonstration of a truly high performant decentralized end-end encrypted application. This will spur the demand for end-end security for any remote-work collaborative application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide new infomration on cognitive health. The support includes 60 M people who identify as athletes, 3 M annually suffering traumatic brain injuries, and the 40 M more looking to measure brain health. Current healthcare assessments are available at specialized facilities with trained professionals and detect only significant changes to cognition. In contrast, this project develops an affordable, reliable way to measure brain health and to monitor changes after treatment, training, and rehabilitation. This project leverages expertise in human performance, cognitive neuroscience, computer science and virtual reality simulation. Furthermore, it offers athletes a way to assess cognitive abilities such as focus, decision making and multitasking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the technical aspects of training, measuring, analyzing and reporting how people perform athletic and cognitive tasks in unison. These domains of research and technical knowledge come together to form a unique cognition platform that accounts for both physical and cognitive behavior. The platform's measurement instruments reflect cutting-edge research on (1) human perception, specifically in fast-paced and dynamic environments; and (2) the interplay of perception and action in a virtual reality environment. The analytics engine captures and processes thousands of data points per minute describing object locations in simulated space; users' hands, body and head behavior; and cognitive performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a high-performance, economic, and sustainable carbon fiber material and associated processing technology for consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and mass market automobiles. In current processes, roughly 30% of carbon fiber is typically scrapped during manufacturing. By 2024, an estimated 50,000 metric tons of virgin carbon fiber will be scrapped and disposed in landfills. The proposed technology will extract value from scrapped fiber and prevent disposal, offering up to 25% cost reduction compared with carbon fiber products commercially available today. This technology creates higher usage and new opportunities for this advanced material.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-performance composite that utilizes low-cost and sustainable milled carbon fiber.  An industrial roll-to-roll production process will be used to compound virgin carbon fiber with milled fiber.  These reclaimed fibers are oriented in the Z-axis using a proprietary technology adapted from an industrial process originally developed to make thermoset products.  The proposed project will develop a market-ready thermoplastic product with dense Z-axis reinforcement while retaining key in-plane properties. This new thermoplastic product will be targeted towards translation to high-volume consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and automotive applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help semiconductor chipmakers overcome\
    \ manufacturing challenges in Chemical Mechanical Planarization/Polishing (CMP)\
    \ processes.  CMP processes enable cutting-edge manufacturing; currently chipmakers\
    \ often face scaling difficulties as the size of the smallest features continues\

    \ and increasing process throughput.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research\
    \ (SBIR) Phase II project will improve CMP processes with innovative polishing\
    \ pads. Conventional polishing pads have randomly distributed micropores inside\
    \ of the pads and typically generate around 1% real contact area between the pad\
    \ asperities and wafer during polishing. This leads to unwanted polishing results,\
    \ such as dishing/erosion and scratch defects on chip patterns due to the stress\
    \ concentration on asperities. Conventional pads require a pad conditioning process\
    \ to regenerate the asperities on the pad surface. The polishing processes developed\
    \ under this project use microfabrication technologies to control micro-features\
    \ on the pad surface. Therefore, the contact area between the pad and wafer is\
    \ customizable and controllable up to 30%. This will improve the polishing performance\
    \ precision and consistency, leading to fewer defects. As the micro-features on\
    \ the soft sub-pad are independent, the conformity of the pad increases and the\
    \ pressure on the wafer is evenly distributed across the wafer surface. This will\
    \ significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity,\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to dramatically improve the corrosion protection of metal assets vital to the energy and transportation industries.  Corrosion contributes to the loss of structural integrity of metal structures, which poses a risk to human safety and the surrounding environment. Metal corrosion costs an estimated $2.5 T globally, with US costs representing roughly 25%.  Durable, anticorrosive, highly water-repellent coatings using special materials can potentially double the lifetime of coatings on oil platforms and ships in a way that protects the environment. This extends maintenance cycles and reduces asset lifetime maintenance costs up to 50%. The high performance will also reduce the number of coating layers, reducing labor costs up to 25% per maintenance cycle.  This technology will improve structural safety, reduce maintenance frequency, lengthen the operating lifetimes, improve environmental characteristics, and reduce the costs of operating and maintaining metal assets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project further translates coatings of superhydrophobic smart particles for high-performance anticorrosion paints.  These superhydrophobic particles offer new on-demand release of corrosion inhibitors (active corrosion protection) and superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) into one multi-functional material, unlike current state of practice. The platform nature of the technology enables inclusion of numerous types of corrosion inhibitors to safeguard delicate marine environments. Smart particles can then be incorporated into many existing coating systems to deliver a unique combination of durable, anticorrosive, and highly water-repellent coatings. This project will optimize production processes and conduct verification and validation tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to improve public health.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment (PPE), including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), have been critical to containing disease spread and protecting first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. Shortages of FFRs have led public health agencies to provide guidance in favor of FFR decontamination and re-use as a crisis capacity strategy. This project seeks to develop a cost-effective approach to support sterilization and re-use of personal protective equipment at the point-of-care. The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the high cost and poor safety of Lithium-ion batteries in new energy applications. Low-cost and safe batteries will improve economic viability for solar energy storage, which is critical to increasing renewables penetration to above 30% of total power generation. This project advances a battery material to provide lower cost, higher safety and improved cyclability compared to currently used materials. This can support new batteries in applications including electric vehicles, grid-tied and solar storage, and consumer power tools, among others.

    This SBIR project proposes a novel nanostructured LiMn2O4 cathode chemistry (ND-LMO) that offers ~30% lower $/kWh cost compared to incumbent nickel managanese cobalt oxides (NMC) materials. Furthermore, it will have iimproved performance parameters, such as cycle life, a safer heat generation profile, and a 10% greater amp-hour capacity between full state of charge and maximum depth of discharge. Many of these improvements stem from the “intercalation-pseudocapacitive” properties of finely nanostructured electrode materials. Technical challenges, such as inactive and deactivating surfaces, synthetic costs, and others, must be addressed for these systems to be commercially viable.  The project’s proposed composition and methods used can be applied to other material systems.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an easy-to-use virtual reality (VR) toolkit to enable rapid development and deployment of educational VR experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the “backward design” approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve shellfish production at scale and in an environmentally sustainable fashion, using oyster farming as a launching pad.  Today, most oysters are farmed nearshore under ecological stress.  This project advances the culturing of microalgae using internal waste streams and those from other food industries. The focus of this project is to process one of the most abundant, sustainable, and freely available industrial food wastes, spent yeast from breweries, to facilitate algae production at scale onshore and indoors. Although currently used primarily by the food and chemical industries, the less costly algal product could also energize areas of food and feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, biomaterials, and bioremediation services.

    The proposed project will advance the use of off-the-shelf bioreactors and a novel substrate which, along with CO2, form plant tissue heterotrophically in the dark as leaves do photosynthetically in the presence of sunlight. The proposed substrate enables production at scale of the single-celled microalgae that comprise much of the nearshore bivalve diet.  The yeast is fermented with both agriculture-grade vitamins and plant-based commodities.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel genetic trait that allows plants to rapidly respond to attacking pathogens. Despite modern agricultural practices and chemistry improvements, almost 40% of all crop production is lost due to pests and pathogens each year; within the U.S. over 25% of soybean production is lost this way. These losses are even more severe in regions where pesticide application is prohibitively expensive for farmers.  This project develops a new technology for use in soybean and other oilseed crops to protect against plant disease.

    The proposed project will develop a broad-spectrum pathogen resistance trait.  While the first generation of transgenic trait technologies conferring herbicide tolerance and insecticidal traits have been readily established for oilseed production across North and South America, further development has faltered due to the complexity of these plant traits. Unfortunately, the proteins that provide the best tolerance to adverse environmental conditions also result in toxic side-effects when produced in healthy plants; consequently, the utility of developing these proteins is limited. Current methods for regulating expression of resistance proteins introduced into plants through genetic engineering are insufficient to regulate toxic proteins/compounds that may have side-effects in other environmental conditions. The proposed project will demonstrate an expression system that responds to signals, common to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, in the early and late stages of the plant immune response to release the production of anti-microbial proteins only in when needed, effectively eliminating the off-target side-effects. The project objectives are to 1) perform field and greenhouse trial of soybean with this technology to ascertain extent of pathogen resistance and yield effects in infected and healthy conditions; 2) optimize the technology for tissue specific (i.e., roots vs. leaves) use in soybean; 3) conduct greenhouse experiments to determine response to pathogen detection in canola, cotton, and potato as candidates for future field trials and commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need special probes or dyes to detect viruses.

    The proposed project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images from the common 96-well plate.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve agricultural operations with respect to infection.  Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.

    The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal’s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal’s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable plastic recycling process. In the United States less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the remainder are incinerated (15%) or placed in landfills (75%). Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.  This project develops a low-temperature system for high quality, high-value plastic products in closed-loop recycling.

    The proposed project will apply synthetic biology and related biotechnologies to identify, engineer, and optimize new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.  These enzymes will enable closed-loop plastic recycling in an economically viable, low temperature, low CO2 emission process.   The first objective is to sample plastic contaminated environments for naturally occurring enzymes that have evolved to depolymerize PE and PET synthetic polymers.  Candidate PE and PET enzymes will be engineered to accelerate their ability to efficiently target and cut complex PE and PET polymers under scalable process conditions.  Millions of enzyme variants will be constructed, tested, and analyzed using synthetic biology, high-throughput screening, and machine learning technologies.  A primary goal of this effort is to demonstrate a 10-fold increase in PE and PET depolymerization rates compared to naturally occurring plastic degradation proteins.

    \ sensor technology can be adapted for use across the extremely wide THz spectrum,\
    \ which has implications for many industries.   \n\nThe intellectual merit of\
    \ this project is primarily its integration of both high resolution and high-speed\
    \ aspects of THz imaging, as these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated\
    \ in a commercially viable form. Previous demonstrations have either involved\
    \ slow scanning systems that preclude real time applications or cameras that target\
    \ much higher bands of the THz spectrum. The latter restriction stems from an\
    \ inability to manufacture arrays of large pixels to image at the longer THz wavelengths.\
    \  Going beyond one of a kind laboratory proof of concept experiments, the THz\
    \ camera seeks to provide resolution and frame update rates that are relevant\
    \ to actual applications. The commercial manufacturing viability of the sensing\
    \ element may ensure that applications beyond the initial medical market will\
    \ be practical.  The camera will feature not only the high-resolution THz imaging\
    \ near the 250-350 GHz spectrum but also incorporate high-resolution visible and\
    \ near-infrared cameras that can complement the THz video, with trials being planned\
    \ for hospital usage.  In addition to clinical usage scenarios, the imaging system\
    \ can be adapted for use in airport security and other screening applications,\
    \ as portability and ease of use will guide the demonstration system design.\n\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an oral delivery platform that can deliver various drugs to the gastrointestinal tract. The market for novel biologics and oral formulations of currently injectable biologics is increasing rapidly, as is the market for gene therapies, necessitating a versatile oral drug delivery platform. This platform would positively impact society by reducing the need for repeated injections. This system would improve ease of administration of injectables by improving oral availability and the transport to the intestinal cells, and subsequent secretion of the protein into the bloodstream. This would also allow for local delivery of therapeutics for intestinal diseases which currently are hampered by poor mucus penetration and represent a multibillion-dollar market. Successful translation of this technology would benefit pharmaceutical companies, patients, and payers by providing an oral delivery platform for a broad range of therapeutics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of improving systemic expression of a protein from the gastrointestinal tract following oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The role of digestive tract is to breakdown lipids and nucleic acids and it has therefore been very challenging to for gene delivery vehicles to survive and deliver cargo to the intestine. The project advances a new lipid nanoparticle system able to protect the genetic cargo to generate protein expression in intestinal cells later secreted into the bloodstream for systemic circulation. This process converts previously injected protein drugs into an easily administered oral drug. The research objectives are to screen and optimize several of the lipid components as well as the nucleic acid to improve secreted expression of a protein into the blood after oral delivery. This research will screen multiple formulations and cargos in vivo and measure serum protein levels after oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The anticipated technical results are that the level of secreted protein will improve 10x from the initial formulation, further increasing the scope of potential therapeutic targets for the oral lipid nanoparticle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of blood clotting and associated bleeding risks in neonatal and pediatric patients as well as vulnerable adult patients. Existing systems put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. Using only a single drop of blood, the proposed non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting for all patients and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by more than 3x. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $1.1 billion annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood. The basis of the technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation. Due to its non-contact feature and low sample volume requirement, this technology can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The goal of this project is to develop and test a system for fast, reliable, and easy-to-use drop-of-blood coagulation analysis under sterile conditions. This goal will be achieved by meeting four objectives: 1) develop the module for automatic sample deployment from standard blood collection tubes; 2) implement environmental control and sample containment (“acoustic cartridge”); 3) assemble prototype devices and develop the control software with improved workflow and a user-friendly interface; and 4) assess prototype reliability, standardize it for coagulation measurements, and conduct initial clinical testing.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is its potential to lower healthcare costs\
    \ and enhance the quality of life for breast cancer survivors, along with those\
    \ suffering from traumatic injuries, skin ulcers, and other surgical wounds. For\
    \ breast conserving surgery (BCS), which represents the standard of care for early-stage\
    \ breast cancer, the most assured way of achieving satisfactory outcomes is complete\
    \ tumor removal and preservation of breast cosmesis in a single surgery. Unfortunately,\
    \ the rates of BCS-related complications, deformities, and secondary surgeries\
    \ remain high (20-40%), which increases healthcare costs and negatively impacts\
    \ patient quality of life. To address these problems, this project furthers development\
    \ of an in-situ, scaffold-forming collagen designed as a conformable and regenerative\
    \ filler for soft tissue defects and voids. This soft-tissue filler has the potential\
    \ to improve breast surgeons’ ability to provide predictable and pleasing outcomes\
    \ to their patients. Further, the versatility of this collagen polymer means that\
    \ it can be used for a variety of other clinical applications (e.g., vocal fold\
    \ medialization, therapeutic cells, and drug delivery) and to create regenerative\
    \ tissue products for other areas of major unmet clinical need (e.g., cartilage,\
    \ skeletal muscle). \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II\
    \ project seeks to complete the final technical hurdles to commercialize the novel\
    \ collagen polymer referred to above. Recognizing the significance of collagen\
    \ as the body’s primary tissue building material, this patented biomaterial platform\
    \ was designed to be highly purified and to retain collagen’s natural fibril-forming\
    \ (polymerization) capacity. While this technology offers a broad range of customization\
    \ potential, this project focuses on development of an in-situ, scaffold-forming\
    \ collagen to accelerate and improve healing outcomes of complex cavity, tunneling,\
    \ and deep penetrating tissue defects. The collagen is applied as a conformable\
    \ liquid, which rapidly transitions to a fibrillar scaffold with soft tissue consistency.\
    \ Preclinical studies evaluating this product as a breast tissue filler following\
    \ lumpectomy have documented the following: 1) ease of use, 2) conformability\
    \ to patient-specific voids, 3) noninflammatory regenerative healing, and 4) compatibility\
    \ with standard clinical procedures. This SBIR project seeks to achieve key commercialization\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable radiotherapies for metastatic cancer, estimated to account for 90% of the 600,000 cancer deaths in the US each year. Of the approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the US, nearly half are candidates for improved outcomes using some form of radiation-based therapy. Metastatic cancer, however, is generally not treated with radiotherapies due to the need for prior knowledge of the metastatic sites. The proposed project treats metastatic cancer by using the cancer cells themselves to help deliver the radiation. This technology may generate reliable efficacy of radiotherapy for the treatment of the most lethal forms of cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to advance radiotherapy that exploits cancer cells themselves as catalysts for therapeutic delivery. After systemic administration or local injection, the monomers are expected to diffuse through tissues and subsequently polymerize, immobilizing radionuclides in the extracellular space of cancer cells.  Non-cancerous cells will be minimally impacted, as soluble monomers will remain subject to diffusion and relatively rapid tissue clearance in the absence of cancer cell-derived catalysts. The chemistry at the core of the approach is an enzyme-triggered polymerization of native-like compounds under physiological conditions.  The final therapeutic compound features the polymerizable compound and covalently-conjugated radionuclide 131-I, a commonly used radiotherapy isotope.

Dangerously high pressures, flow rates, and volumes of air flow can result in complications such as gastric insufflation, and less frequently, aspiration pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, barotrauma, volutrauma, and pneumothorax. There is an urgent need for an intervention to improve patient safety during manual ventilation with the resuscitator bag. This project involves the development of a safety device to be used with all standard BVMs on the market to regulate air flow and pressure. The device that will offer safe, affordable, and optimized ventilation while minimizing gastric insufflation.  The technology should have broad applications across the entire care continuum, but especially in emergency and battlefield medicine.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project seeks to further develop and optimize the BVM safety. This effort optimizes the haptic and auditory feedback the provider receives when using the device and optimizes the design and manufacturability of the product. In addition, biocompatibility studies and animal studies of the device in anesthetized pigs and in pigs undergoing cardiac arrest will provide data necessary for FDA clearance. This Phase II work will ensure that patients will receive the most optimal evidence-based treatment and will help establish the safety device as the standard of care.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves leveraging an innovative approach to deliver and monitor therapeutics more effectively. Real-time monitoring and tracking of immune and stem cell therapies is in its infancy. However, without the capability to precisely know where therapeutic cells localize, clinicians cannot assess safety, design optimal doses, or make clinical decisions related to therapeutic approaches. As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients. This proposal addresses a critical unmet need in the cell and gene therapy industry for rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic cells specifically to enable tracking in the body. The addressable market for preclinical and clinical cell tracking in clinical trials involving therapeutic cells in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $1.14 billion by 2024.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an innovative approach to intracellular delivery where mechanoporation or cell-squeezing is achieved simply by propelling cells, in the presence of exogeneous cargo, through a proprietary mechanoporation element that resides in a column designed to be processed in a centrifuge (spin column). End users will realize significant advantages over conventional and microfluidic approaches to intracellular delivery including: 1) Convenient spin column format; 2) Short cell processing times; 3) Ease of scale-up and multiplexing; 4) Applicability to numerous cell types; and 5) Compatibility with automated/robotic cell production systems including autologous cell production systems designed for clinical settings. Three objectives are proposed involving the generation of prototype spin columns and their use in optimizing aspects of element design to afford efficient intermolecular delivery of iron-based nanoparticles (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent) into T-cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells. The study will enable rapid point-of-care labeling of therapeutic and regenerative cells for in vivo tracking, empowering clinicians to make timely decisions with respect to treatment strategies, thus ensuring better clinical outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to revolutionize wildlife field work and research. Many wildlife professionals already understand the potential for using video as a sensor, but without commercial software to turn video into data, its vast benefits remain untapped. It is important to monitor environmental effects and the impact of urban growth; billions of dollars are spent annually understanding how construction and infrastructure projects are impacting species and habitats. The state of practice is to send technicians into the field for observation. In many situations using a camera system to monitoring for wildlife is not only safer and more effective, but also much less expensive that using human labor. This project will reduce the cost, decrease the timeline, and yield better outcomes for these important conservation efforts, allowing the existing biodiversity to be preserved.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a web-based software-as-a-service to detect, track, and classify wildlife from video and images captured in the field. There is substantial potential for video to provide better data to help wildlife biologists perform their work, but the main barrier is the complexity. Using video systems to study wildlife requires advanced multidisciplinary knowledge; appropriate camera technology, recording methods, advanced video processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.  There are currently no commercial-off-the-shelf hardware or software packages available for biologists. This project will reduce the complexity of obtaining quantitative data from video by developing commercial-off-the-shelf equipment packages, automated video processing software, and the advisory services needed to make this transformational technology more accessible to biologists in the field.  The video processing needed is the focus of the research; the goal is the create algorithms that automate object detection and classification from the video and allow non-experts to create an accurate machine learning classifier with minimal labeling requirements.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel tool to visualize indoor spaces.  Emerging “property technology” (PropTech) plays an increasing role in the development of new large commercial buildings; it is anticipated that such PropTech will save billions of dollars per year and stimulate remodeling projects that might not otherwise even be undertaken, once it is made more broadly accessible, and may thus be adopted for the remodeling of small businesses, restaurants, and residences. This project develops a simple, rapid, and affordable generation of accurate floor plans of existing structures, leveraging commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) camera technology (implemented in modern tablets and smartphones) coupled with advanced AI software and algorithms that model and identify common features (walls, doors, windows, furniture) in the 3D images generated by such devices.  The floor plans so generated will provide an accurate, easily generated framework upon which substantial renovations can then be more easily designed.  This is anticipated largely replace the labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes of floor plan generation, thereby reducing operating costs and stimulating new remodeling projects in various markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an AI-driven app that quickly and autonomously reconstructs digital spatial layouts of indoor spaces based on walk through calibrated image capture with modern smartphones or tablets, leveraging time-of-flight or structured-light imaging systems together with embedded motion sensors and advanced data analysis. The key intellectual merit of this project is the deep neural networks and optimization algorithms, together with advanced user-interface/user-experience (UI/UX) to provide an intuitive human interface to this data analysis engine.  This enables adjustment of the reconstruction rules and visualization of the generated model. The technical hurdles include accurate 3D scene reconstruction and 2D floor plan generation based on sensor-generated point clouds and feature recognition in cluttered environments, and the synthesis of multi-room maps from several single-room models.  Rules can be specified by the user as appropriate (defining room adjacency, wall thickness, orthogonality assumptions, etc.).

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce financial fraud by closing the gap between current secure computation technologies and the technical requirements of modern anti-money laundering. Banks and financial institutions have a strong interest in creating a secure data exchange mechanism. In 2020 alone, the global fraud and anti-money laundering compliance costs exceeded $181 Billion. Audit and transaction monitoring accounted for 19% of this total expenditure. A single-digit percentage improvement in these two categories represents a market opportunity worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A major benefit of the proposed platform is that the complex financial dynamics of organized crime can be targeted and reduced. In addition to anti-money laundering and fraud detection, the secure computation framework generated by this proposal, i.e., a scalable and fast secure data exchange platform, can be applied to areas such as healthcare, the insurance industry, and national security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to create a systematic solution to overcome the current limitations in fighting fraudulent bank transactions. The main roadblock for effective detection of fraud and money laundering is the lack of a comprehensive view of client data. Currently, each bank has limited information about the client's financial activity and cannot benefit from a holistic view of the client’s profile in other banks. Naive solutions, such as creating a central data exchange entity, have been rendered impractical due to critical data security and privacy concerns. In this project, the team proposes a new methodology to address this challenge by leveraging advanced Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC). Unlike anonymization approaches that hide a specific part of customers’ data, secure computation protocols guarantee data confidentiality even during a joint computation. In the past, SMPC has been impractical due to enormous computational and communication costs. However, the company has made both theoretical and practical breakthroughs that make SMPC more feasible for effective detection of fraud and money laundering. Further research and development is needed to make the solution truly applicable to real-world anti-money laundering scenarios, and thereby produce a technology that can drastically improve fraud detection.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several industries, the company’s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase.  The project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent flows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The software  will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows. The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions. The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy simulations of the vortical wake.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to mitigate healthcare costs and challenges associated with the nation's growing aging population. The outcome of this project will be a system that enables holistic, accurate, and faster monitoring of elderly people that will 1) improve quality of life and health of senior citizens, 2) address the future nursing shortage, particularly in the geriatric field, and 3) reduce healthcare costs. The proposed technology can impact a wide range of public health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health monitoring.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project applies real-time computer vision and sensor fusion processing for real-time continuous monitoring and analysis of health-related activities. In addition, this project takes an essential step beyond current solutions by analyzing seniors' group behavior and interactions with objects to determine whether they suffer from loneliness, behavioral disorders, or confusion states. This project utilizes multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize the discriminative power to understand human micro-body motions and thereby create a training framework for personalized behavioral understanding and monitoring. It also proposes an innovative solution to leverage the results of computer vision as attention feedback to thermal sensors to enhance the accuracy and robustness of thermal processing against temperature variations. Furthermore, the project offers an integrative edge-based Internet of Things solution to protect citizens' privacy while providing real-time continuous feedback to responsible personnel. The proposed system offers a novel user experience while protecting personally identifiable information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases, often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  An unbiased screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further enhanced binding to FcRn.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a novel, predictive analytics\
    \ technology for industrial enterprises that require low-latency analytics insights,\
    \ i.e., companies that cannot afford the kind of delayed insights that are widely\
    \ present in almost all Cloud-based analytics solutions. Large manufacturing and\
    \ energy enterprises are comprised of multiple plants sites spread across different\
    \ geographical locations. These plants contain critical processes and equipment\
    \ that are monitored using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Predictive\
    \ analytics, a key component in digital transformation, targets the analysis of\
    \ large volumes of industrial data to generate insights to improve the efficiency\
    \ of industrial operations, optimize processes, and reduce the life cycle costs\
    \ of critical equipment and machinery. The prevailing solutions in today’s market\
    \ rely on using the Cloud to consolidate data, perform analytics, and extract\
    \ valuable insights. This process creates significant delays for many industrial\
    \ processes that require immediate insights into their critical operations. The\
    \ process is also not suitable for companies that have heightened security and\
    \ privacy protocols (such as nuclear plants and defense manufacturing). The company\
    \ seeks to enable companies to conduct predictive analytics on geographically\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to save water and energy across a wide spectrum of industrial and commercial applications (i.e. boilers, baking ovens, furnaces, proofers, HVAC systems) that emit wet exhaust into the environment. For example, the U.S. bread baking market segment alone may save over 50 million therms of energy and over 400 million gallons of water annually with the proposed technology.  The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon’s optimal performance at unconventional conditions. The non-linear phase-change heat transfer mechanisms will be defined and simulated, followed by a sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the channel geometry and thermosiphons array for subsequent prototype design and performance demonstration.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make a new class of antibody-based immunotherapies that can be generally applicable to oncology patients. For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy using a novel and proprietary precision gene editing technology. The proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of gene editing by optimizing the precision of editing to correct the disease. This technology can be used to improve and even cure patients of genetic disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using a novel and proprietary CRISPR-Cas precision gene editing system. Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases. However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies. This project will develop an engineered anti-CRISPR (ErAcr) protein to eliminate unintended off-target editing. The ErAcr protein will be paired with a novel CRISPR-Cas nuclease and developed into a therapy for SMA> The therapy will be packaged into an adeno-associated viral vector and tested for editing and SMA disease correction in patient-derived cells and in an SMA mouse model. Effective editing will lead to disease correction in both patient cells and mice with no observable off-target editing events.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent and treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with associated healthcare costs exceeding $327 billion. Current therapies often present adverse effects or are ineffective in some patients. The top five human diabetes drugs alone are expected to cost $23 billion annually by 2024.  This project advances a novel diabetic treatment composed of a postbiotic mixture from beneficial gut bacteria. This will improve clinical outcomes for prediabetic patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of a potential microbiome-based treatment toward an oral treatment that effectively reduces diabetes-associated markers. The three technical objectives are to: 1) evaluate the technology and demonstrate equivalent or superior performance compared to existing antidiabetic drugs, 2) better understand the mechanism that leads to efficacy in the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and 3) identify the active molecule(s) from the postbiotic mixture. These objectives will be carried out using rodent trials, cell-based assays, and advanced separation techniques.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance clinical outcomes for patients with a traumatic or palliative peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In the U.S., 20 million people suffer from PNIs, with a high prevalence among young individuals and a total economic cost to society in excess of $150 billion per year. Acute PNIs account for more than 500,000 annual surgical procedures in the U.S and frequently result in permanent disability. This project develops a platform technology with the potential to address many types of PNI.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a novel nerve graft/conduit for nerve gap injury repair and a nerve cap.  The project goal is to advance a solution to improve the nerve functional outcome while still reducing the tension across the repair.  It provides a tissue-like matrix that allows aligned nerve growth out of the free nerve ending. The technology is derived from decellularized porcine nerve tissue and maintains native structural and functional proteins, providing an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration. This project conducts in-vivo studies, sterilization demonstrations, and lyophilization. Supply chain security, packaging development, and tooling will be developed in preparation for commercial launch.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop strategies to mitigate occlusion of thoracic catheters (chest tubes). A study by the Cleveland Clinic determined that 36% of chest tubes were completely obstructed at one point, with 86% of these clots existing in the thoracic cavity, undetected by clinicians. The complications that result from occluded chest tubes can include postoperative atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade. The team will design, develop, and commercialize a novel chest tube to solve the high impact clinical need. This  novel chest tube seeks to reduce drainage-related complications following cardiothoracic surgery. The novel system proactively manages fluid flow within the inner lumen of a catheter in order to flush and drain the tube, reducing the incidence of blood clogging.

    The proposed activity seeks to develop a chest tube that proactively provides fluid flow in order to prevent blood clot formation associated with draining fluid and blood during cardiovascular surgery. The product introduces a novel approach called dilutional coagulopathy for addressing clotting issues, where sterile saline or anticoagulants is proactively used to reduce thrombosis in an enclosed drainage spaces, rather than rely on historical methods of chemical or mechanical barriers for reducing or hindering clot formation. The project aims to develop prototypes using biomaterials and fabrication methods suitable for eventual patient use, and undertake the risks of demonstrating proof of concept and reduced clotting in an animal model of post-surgical drainage complications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is develop an innovative medical technology for localized and sustained antibiotic treatment in the case of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The proposed activities may result in commercialization of an implant with novel reservoir technology to be placed at the infected site, and which will locally deliver antibiotics to eradicate the infection. This solution may improve patient care as well as reduce costs associated with treatment of infection. The development of an implantable, antibiotic-eluting orthopedic spacer which enables patients to return to ambulatory conditions while providing sustained, appropriate, anti-infection resistance for a sustained duration could benefit patients and reduce medical costs. The proposed product seeks to reduce infections and reduce the need for surgical revision and significant antibiotic treatments. If successful, this technology will reduce the burden associated with unresolved infections and avoid amputations.

    This team will design, develop, and validate the proof of concept for an orthopedic spacer. The system will be 3-D printed using a novel porous medium capable of controlled antibiotic elution.  The product will be tested using benchtop mechanical testing and in vitro studies of implanted system viability and controlled elution. The objectives include a study of the prototype's ability to meet design criteria for mechanical performance, as well as a demonstration of a superior antibiotic elution profile over an extended-release period. The mechanical testing to be performed include load, stress, and cycle testing within current standards, in conjunction with in vitro laboratory elution testing of the specified antibiotic substance over a sustained duration of time (up to >180 days).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the creation of a "digital twin," a real-world system projected into spatially-computed environment such as virtual and augmented reality. This technology creates the infrastructure necessary for the application of virtual and augmented reality in industrial workplaces, at scale. By making the full-scale roll out of these technologies possible, the technology seeks to impact human health and safety, operational efficiencies, and environmental risk reduction for process operations facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The long term impacts of the technology may also enable automation and optimization, improving their efficiency, security, and safety. Such facilities are critical infrastructure and play a significant role in the national economy. The availability of this product may also enhance market opportunities for other businesses in the scanning, spatial computing, and training markets. The impact may be further broadened by adapting the process for digital twin production to new domains unrelated to the industrial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing knowledge and understanding in both machine learning and spatial computing. This project focuses on a method for digitizing a complex, real-world system, in an efficient manner, sufficient to recreate the captured reality as an interactive digital twin. The primary technical hurdle is the combining of different data sources that describe aspects of a particular real-world system into a single complete description. The initial physical systems being modelled are industrial process operations, but the core methods could apply to other types of systems, including natural systems, such as a rainforest. For industrial process operations, the goal is to encode the entire process operations facilities at the component level, with sub-cm accuracy, at 10% of the current time and cost requirements. To achieve this, this project will combine physical scans with engineering documentation and relational probabilities. Once combined, the model will be used as the basis for a digital twin of the real-world system projected into spatial computed environments, such as virtual and augmented reality. These techniques replace a tedious and impractical static scan and human labor workflow with rapid scans, computer vision, and a combination of procedural and trained algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of
    conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often
    uncomfortable in the early days because they aren’t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student
    personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be development of a novel platform for the design and high-volume fabrication of microfluidic devices for educational and research purposes. Currently used fabrication methods are not conducive to the large-scale production of robust, high quality, open-channel microfluidic devices that are cost-effective for widespread use outside of specialty applications. The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels. The kits will contribute to educational efforts that address the nation’s demand for STEM professionals, projected to grow at twice the rate of all occupations in the next 10 years, while training students in a field expected to reach a $60 billion market value by 2029.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to eliminate the main technical hurdles that prevent the large scale production of open-channel microfluidic devices. Current lithographic, additive and micromilling fabrication technologies require a combination of expertise, equipment and production time that make them ill-suited for the purpose of assembling devices that are inexpensive and robust enough for consumer use, for example, in educational settings. The proposed platform will leverage new and existing high-volume fabrication technologies to manufacture film-based devices with channels and chambers measured in the tens and hundreds of micrometers, featuring strong bonding between layers to allow for high pressure flow, and at a projected cost of <0.15 USD per device. Research objectives include the development of gravity-based and hand powered pump setups appropriate for educational and low resource settings. The advancements in device fabrication processes achieved in this project are expected to have a positive impact beyond the field of education, facilitating the commercialization of microfluidic technologies in fields like analytical chemistry, biomanufacture and point-of-care biosensing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a stronger understanding of how living things absorb carbon in the ocean. It is important to have an accurate measure of the natural carbon uptake by the ocean because this affects ocean and fishery health, as well as future efforts to intentionally sequester carbon in the ocean to mitigate climate change. This goal will be achieved by developing a low-cost sensor that can be widely deployed on ocean robots, which are already being used to measure processes like ocean heat uptake. The sensor will use light to detect sinking debris in the ocean.  This debris is a major way that carbon is naturally sequestered in the ocean. Distributed, robotic platforms in the ocean allow observations to be made in locations and seasons that are not accessible with research ships. Such platforms are generally lower cost than sensors associated with research ships. Development and sale of sensors for robotic platforms are areas of growth because of the increasing reliance on these platforms for scientific observations. This project may also enhance academic and industry partnerships and help to train upcoming scientists and engineers in instrument development.

    There is a significant desire to expand measurements of ocean biological carbon pump processes to better understand climate change, in particular the flux of carbon by particles settling out of the surface ocean. This project will create a sensor that is designed to be carried aboard globally distributed, autonomous profiling floats.  The sensors/floats may help distinguish among the different modes of biological carbon uptake in the ocean. The sensor will be designed from the ground up to meet the challenges of sampling floats, which have stringent power consumption, cost, and data quality-control requirements. The sensor will also have specific optical and housing geometry characteristics tailored for measurement of sinking particle fluxes. The development stages will consist of optical modeling of proposed sensor geometries, modeling of particle collection efficiencies of different housing geometries, laboratory testing of model particles, and dissemination of results to the scientific community.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.  Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.

    The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).  The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – often called “forever” chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.

The innovation holds immense potential to replace harmful and hazardous materials, including asbestos, in many regions of the world, store captured carbon into long-lifecycle products, and reduce heating and cooling energy use.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will: (i) refine the design of the 3D panel geometry used to make commercial-size panels with improved load-carrying capacity and constructability; (ii) improve the bamboo-stranding process, evaluate a bio-based adhesive system, impart fire-retardance, enhance panel durability, manufacture panels using the new geometry, and evaluate performance; and (iii) demonstrate and evaluate panel use as a roofing material through field tests and the versatility of the corrugated panel in interior and exterior energy-efficient building products. This research will advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing challenges of long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including moisture resistance, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide environmentally friendly, self-cleaning coating technologies. Fluorinated materials, known as forever materials, have been widely used due to their excellent self-cleaning properties, but the detrimental environmental impacts resulting from these coatings motivate the introduction of environmentally friendly solutions. This project plans to create a new technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties, and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g., excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion) while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and 3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the technology into  relevant applications. The anticipated results include successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace, to name a few.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is utilizing thermal energy management to simultaneously improve the affordability, comfort, and safety of buildings, with an initial focus on meeting urgent market demand for non-combustible building insulation.  This project will focus on developing a lightweight, easy-to-install, non-combustible insulation product which is also eco-friendly and non-toxic.  Structure fires represent 37% of all fires in the US. These fires caused $12.3 billion in property damage and 80% of civilian fire deaths.  Wildfires in the Western US, where >$220 billion in residential construction is in “extreme” wildfire-prone areas, add to the urgency of this situation.  Mineral wool is the only non-combustible insulation product available today but requires personal protective equipment for installation and was recently classified as carcinogenic.  Fully non-combustible building insulation is a high growth market, and the broader market for all types of non-flammable insulation represents a significant opportunity.  This Phase II project seeks to cost-effectively increase the supply of energy-efficient, non-combustible buildings for both new and retrofit construction, while also addressing high-temperature industrial markets which have the most intensive energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up a novel nanocomposite insulation product using a proprietary foaming process for inorganic aerogel-based insulation that minimizes shrinkage (thus maximizing porosity for insulation performance and minimizing material and processing cost). This approach leverages readily available materials such as clay and silica, as well as potentially renewable cellulose biomass, to produce an environmentally friendly, high performance insulation product for non-combustible buildings which is easy to install, lightweight, and non-toxic.  Successfully scaling this approach on existing manufacturing equipment may solve a significant materials research challenge, creating organic-inorganic nanocomposites for thermal insulation with a competitive cost / performance ratio versus incumbent products such as fiberglass, mineral wool, and plastic foams.  The Phase II project may result in the first industrially-engineered composite material for thermal insulation which is fully non-combustible.  The integration of flexible polymers and radiation blocking additives would also enable use for high-temperature industrial pipe insulation, a critical energy-saving application where most existing products have significant limitations due to radiation loss.

    \ Phase I project is to reduce emergency medical services (EMS) response times\
    \ and improve patient outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) through\

    \ for more than 450,000 deaths annually and is the third leading cause of death\
    \ in the United States. Of these deaths, ~350,000 occur outside of the hospital.\
    \ Survival for OHCA in the U.S. is around 8%-10%, and despite considerable effort\
    \ this statistic has changed little over the past three decades. The solution\
    \ to improving OHCA outcomes is early and effective bystander cardiopulmonary\
    \ resuscitation (e.g., chest compressions) and prompt defibrillation using an\
    \ automated external defibrillator (AED). In locations with publicly-available\
    \ AEDs, survival has increased 40%-70%. However, ~70% of OHCAs events occur in\
    \ private residence, and public-access AEDs are not available for these patients.\
    \ Drones can deliver AEDs to the scene of a cardiac arrest more quickly than a\

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to remediate the 17 million tons of textile waste that ends up in landfills annually. Working within the existing economic drivers of the clothing industry, this project aims to deploy technology that can profitably transition the USA away from a wasteful zero-sum linear raw materials model into a resilient local and sustainable circular economy. This project will enable local communities, urban and rural alike, to create economic value (raw materials and jobs) out of textile waste, with a drastic reduction in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions compared to business as usual. This project will develop technology that has an impact on the security and sustainability of the US textile raw materials marketplace, by enabling a re-shoring of an industry in a distributed way that can affect every single American through their clothing purchasing options. If successful, the US could lead the world into a new era of a truly sustainable circular economy for fashion.

    This project aims to advance knowledge and develop the core technologies required for widespread adoption and commercialization of cellulosic textile recycling within the American textile manufacturing industry. By leveraging core competencies and innovative models for polymer science and continuous process design, this project will develop a non-destructive extractive process that will locally and domestically convert end-of-life textile waste into high-value cellulosic circular economy feedstocks of equal or greater quality to virgin material at kilogram scale. As part of this project, the focus will be on extracting cellulose from mixed material textile waste that contain other contaminant components that often hinder its recycling. This approach involves innovative mixtures of green chemistry that enable the rapid extraction of cotton, the spinning of novel fibres, and the efficient recovery of the process chemicals. This project will optimise and further develop this core technology and conduct the prototyping and engineering design required for reproducible cellulosic material (cotton) extraction from clothing waste and its demonstration at multi-kg scale.

Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for skin cancer because it results in the highest cure rates, but it often takes place in stages, extending surgical procedures. The use of ex vivo confocal microscopy (XVM) is potentially faster, less costly, and inherently both 3-D and digitized, with benefits including: 1) enhanced accuracy, precision, and margin control via enriched 3D information content and simplified specimen orientation maintenance, decreasing error and improving functional outcomes; 2) decreased duration of open surgical wounds potentially reducing the rate of complications; and (3) enhanced and accelerated surgical workflows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve Mohs surgery and other margin screening applications. Using confocal image processing software, the proposed software will improve current pathology processing methods by enabling rapid processing and re-coloring of XVM images, visualization without the need for retraining, and automated detection of residual tumor at the patient’s bedside, all within minutes. The research described here will result in the production of a fully functional and robust software product through the following development projects: 1) Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software for image preprocessing and colorization/enhancement, and 2) AI-based software for automated identification of key morphological features and diagnosis of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The proposed technology will streamline cancer specimen processing, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses poor long-term public health outcomes stemming from lifestyle choices through an intuitive and effective tool to analyze and optimize their sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mental health. The technology will guide users through an individualized health and well-being analysis based on real-time data that presents an individualized baseline and heat map that helps individuals determine which lifestyle behaviors are most beneficial or detrimental towards their holistic health. This personalized approach seeks to establish new habits, interventions, medications, diets, etc.  This tool may help people to live longer and more fulfilled lives with fewer health concerns and costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project determines the viability of objective measurement of health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, sleep cycles, and exercise) through the integration of already-existent technologies including, but not limited to, wearables and “smart” technologies such as Smart Scales and Smart Blood Pressure cuffs. Additionally, this project will determine the viability of using subjective inputs surrounding diet, mood, and exercise and the ability to draw meaningful correlations between both subjective and objective inputs. This project will develop and validate methods to integrate these two data streams into a health scoring system that may be used to improve physical and mental health and fitness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  II project is to improve disease research and drug discovery. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most impactful and vital tools of biological structure analysis today.  The proposed project improves the current methods to achieve better accuracy and productivity, with faster user training.

    The proposed project improves imaging by cryo-EM. The images currently generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy and thus requires extensive processing to build recognizable structures (proteins and others). Single-particle cryo-EM is a method that produces images of individual particles and can potentially analyze biological structures at the single-molecule level.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques to mitigate the issues.  AI/ML algorithms can automate the workflow, facilitating quality data and the development of 3D models.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on scoliosis physiotherepy. Physiotherapy Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSEs) have been proved effective in treating scoliosis patients; However, PSSE effectiveness can be significantly reduced due to inappropriate planning, unclear requirements, and poor compliance. This project seeks to develop a hardware-software integrated system which employs a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to conduct PSSEs effectively. The technology may save costs for patients, expand services for clinics, and improve the outcomes of scoliosis physiotherapy. The commercialization of the technology will be conducted via business to business and business to customer mechanisms.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development a hardware-software integrated system which employs a patient digital twin (PDT) and a performance capture system to create a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to utilize telehealth communication between physiotherapists and scoliosis patients.  The technology seeks to improve the accuracy and completeness of diagnosis and assessment, optimize physiotherapy design and planning, facilitate effective patient communication and education, and help patients to perform physiotherapeutic exercises according to instructions and compliance requirements. By using PDT, the diagnosis of scoliosis and assessment of spine deformity can be performed in 3D space thus improving the completeness of assessment and the design of PSSEs. By building a light-weight performance capture system, body shape, pose, and motion can be captured in 3D space in real time. The teams seeks to represent the prescribed PSSEs in 3D games by animating the PDT with motion captured during clinic practice. In this way, the actual poses and motions of a patient during home exercise can be monitored, evaluated, and used to instruct with adjusted 3D games as reference. The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed innovation, which will be accomplished through a technical feasibility study, initial prototyping, and a commercial feasibility demonstration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities. This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper insights into their customers’ hair care-related goals, pain points, and health conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors (porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1) Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-esteem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling (unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels) of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation. This project seeks to develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed. This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to ship hulls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas. The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous, electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls. This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial transport and Naval vessels can be addressed.  The project will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve accessibility to robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotic TKA can improve implant positioning accuracy, enhance early functional rehabilitation, and reduce postoperative pain and time to hospital discharge. However, disruption in the operating room caused by current positional tracking systems impedes robotic utilization in TKA procedures. This Phase I project focuses on developing an inside-out tracking system that would free up valuable space in the operating room, eliminate line-of-sight concerns, possibly eliminate secondary incisions, and reduce the robotic system's overall cost. The distributors may be able to integrate this inside-out tracking system into any navigated or robotic surgical system that requires tracking bony anatomy (knee, hip, shoulder, or ankle arthroplasty and spinal or cranial procedures). This innovation targets the global orthopedic surgical robotic device market. The implementation of inside-out tracking may significantly improve the usability of surgical robots, improving their accessibility and, ultimately, improving outcomes for TKA patients.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an inside-out tracking system prototype that is appropriate for surgical bone tracking. Legacy commercial embodiments of inside-out tracking systems are not sufficiently compact and do not possess the necessary processing power for surgical applications. Recently, technological advances have made small form factor cameras with sufficient processing power to enable the realistic development of an inside-out tracking system for surgical robotic use accessible to developers at low cost. In this Phase I project, the team will demonstrate the feasibility of such a system through the following technical objectives: bench test commercial cameras and develop software to capture and process positional data in real-time; integrate an inside-out tracking system into a surgical robotic TKA system, and demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated system in a cadaver study to determine surgeon usability. Successful completion of this project may identify hardware and software that demonstrates the performance necessary for surgical applications and confirm the system's usability with surgeon users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the participation of the underrepresented population of blind and low vision (BLV) persons in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Through a novel assistive technology that provides BLV individuals with multisensory access to scientific data in real time, this technology will enable access  on par with sighted peers. BLV students, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data whether in the laboratory or in the field. This inaccessibility either precludes their full participation in hands-on science inquiry, or leaves them dependent on sighted peers to access real-time data. With this project, BLV students across K-12 and post-secondary institutions, as well as BLV scientists and others interested in STEM, will benefit from a tool that makes it possible for them to work independently in laboratory situations. This innovation will make science laboratory learning and laboratory workplaces more inclusive and equitable for the blind and low vision individuals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing a 2-dimensional, hand-held, portable, refreshable Braille and tactile graphics scientific data collection tool that can be used to collect quantifiable data in real time using wireless sensors. Blind and Low Vision (BLV) students are as capable as their sighted peers in STEM yet, unlike their sighted peers, lack independent access to real-time scientific data in the laboratory. This effort seeks to address this inequity by leveraging the expertise of blind scientists and pioneers in STEM access technology to iteratively develop a interative versions of novel, blind-accessible innovations which will give BLV students, scientists and others access to quantitative data collected in the laboratory or in the field. This innovation will be optimized for the BLV by documenting usability concerns and making the necessary modifications to hardware and source-code prior to field-testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the accuracy, safety, and efficiency of pipe corrosion inspections for petrochemical and other manufacturing facilities. Pipe corrosion is a major issue, estimated to cost 3.4% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), and if left unmanaged, can result in catastrophic safety and economic incidents such as fatalities or fugitive gas emissions (which can total 13 million metric tons/year in oil and gas alone). Current methods to inspect pipe corrosion are expensive, slow, manual, and unable to collect all the necessary data requested by field engineers. The proposed robotic solution addresses these issues by: (1) improving safety and efficiency through improved inspection and localization mechanisms, (2) reducing the need for expensive and dangerous manual auxiliary inspection tasks such as scaffold construction and insulation removal, and (3) reporting significantly higher amounts of analytical data to allow improved decision making by corrosion engineers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of a new. highly-automated, robotic pipe inspection tool. Current inspection data is both difficult and manually-intensive to obtain. A novel pipe crawling robot has been created that enables automated inspection scans of pipes for a niche use case. Improvements in both onboard sensors and spatial positioning may enable widespread commercial adoption. The proposed research will improve the onboard sensor capabilities of the robot for improved corrosion detection uses and create an artificial intelligence-driven positioning system to improve locomotion, obstacle avoidance, and data integrity. Objective 1 requires both mechanical and electrical research, ranging from physical design challenges (including adhering to strict clearance, size, and weight requirements) to data processing experiments to regulatory research. Objective 2 encompasses research in autonomous movement, obstacle avoidance, and three-dimensional geometry reconstruction. The resulting robot may provide the industry with a safer and cheaper method of inspecting critical piping infrastructure, thus preventing potentially catastrophic safety and financial consequences and environmentally-detrimental leaks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to open the path for resource extraction on the Moon, creating an in-space manufacturing industry, allowing for a permanent presence on the Moon, and expanding the ability to explore the inner planets of the solar system. The technology may result in the ability of humans to operate and live in space: building state-of-the-art research infrastructure, exploring the solar system, creating a space economy independent of Earth, and moving terrestrial manufacturing and power generation into space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may provide new insights into electrorefining metal oxide feedstocks, specifically lunar regolith simulants, through high-temperature electrolysis to yield oxygen and metals. Additionally, the proposed technology will address anode stability and advance studies in novel platinum group metal anodes. The team will use multi-physics modeling for high-temperature electrolysis and for modeling low gravity and lunar vacuum environments. The project may result in the ability to extract oxygen and raw metals from lunar regoliths advancing research in space resource extraction efforts. This advancement in knowledge may aide in the research and development efforts in the fields of materials science, inorganic chemistry, and metallurgy which could result in the carbon-free production of steel and other metals on Earth, new anode materials for high-temperature electrolysis, new electrochemical processes for electrorefining raw feedstocks, and the ability to source oxygen and metals from the Moon and other planetary bodies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lower the geohazard risks for assets within critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, transportation, and utilities. More specifically, the proposed technology will make measuring and detecting ground motion with satellite radar more practical in applications where the observed areas cover very long distances and traverse varying terrain and land types. The innovation seeks to demonstrate that the combined processing of multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations can improve the information collected and that the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data can be used to aid insight. The efficacy of space-based satellite radar interferometry in measuring shifts in spatially-sensitive structures such as buried pipelines, foundations, and rail track ballast will be demonstrated over very large areas and linear distances. The technology developed in this project may have a positive impact on the aforementioned sectors by enabling monitoring capabilities that are timelier and more cost-effective than traditional approaches. The geospatial technology may also enable asset operators to be more proactive when it comes to geohazard threats, lowering the frequency of fatal and environmentally-damaging failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the key shortcomings of space-based satellite radar interferometry as a means to monitor surface motion threats to critical infrastructure assets. While interferometric approaches for specific types of terrain have been well documented and validated, approaches that produce coherent ground motion results over very large areas with varying terrain and radar scattering mechanisms have not been successfully deployed. Furthermore, combining multiple interferometric observations together to decompose ground motion has received little research attention despite being an important step in translating the relative line-of-sight satellite observations into ground motion components relevant to asset monitoring. This research effort seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of using multiple imaging frequencies and polarizations and combining their interferometric results to create a more continuous view of ground motion over areas with varying degrees of vegetation. This project may also demonstrate that combining both small baseline subset and persistent scatter interferometric approaches can improve the density of resolved scatterers over areas where land type variations create a diverse range of scattering mechanisms. The team also seeks to  demonstrate the use and accuracy of GNSS data in the reference setting process as insights are translated into absolute motion components about the geodetic reference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a low-cost, flexible, Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Label that is self-powered in all lighted conditions. This Smart Label can be directly attached to packages, shipments, buildings, or worn as a medical device, enabling real-time data with improved accuracy. Sensing labels and asset trackers are extensively used to control inventories and monitor the freshness, quality, safety, and shelf life of perishable goods, as well as pharmaceuticals, foods, healthcare samples, and more. Existing radiofrequency identification (RFID) smart labels have no energy storage or energy harvesting capability. Current asset trackers have rechargeable batteries, with some powered by silicon-based photovoltaics which have poor indoor light performance. This project integrates organic photovoltaics (OPV) into flexible smart labels for continuous power supply under indoor and outdoor light, allowing frequent transmission of data to the cloud. OPV technology will be uniquely tuned to the common indoor light spectra to deliver light-to-electricity performance values over 20%, twice the indoor light performance of the best commercially available silicon photovoltaics. This program will combine flexible OPV with flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) to create a low-cost, flexible, thin, light-weight, and credit-card-sized IoT device with onboard sensors and radios for continuous wireless communication.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a continuously-operating flexible IoT device for flexible IoT smart labels on packaging, asset tracking, and in retail. The current limitations to a completely flexible, OPV-powered IoT device are: (1) OPV has not been specifically tuned to the light emitting diode (LED) spectrum; (2) OPV has not been attached to FHE before; and (3) IoT-Smart-Label-integrated OPV has not existed in production before. Attaching the FHE to OPV is the most significant technical risk, so the goal of this project is to validate flexible OPV-powered IoT smart labels as a viable product, delivering three proof-of-concept prototypes. To achieve this primary goal, the objectives are divided into groups based on eight key elements: (1) develope OPV sheet for printed electronics integration, (2) demonstrate printed device circuits and antenna on the backside of OPV sheets, (3) determine ideal power management chip for conversion to flex-compatible form factor, (4) place and integrate silicon chips, (5) integrate and test the flexible batteries, (6) package/laminate the entire flex label, (7) demonstrate wireless data transfer from the flex IoT device to the cloud, and (8) develop roadmap for manufacturing scale-up in Phase II, including an estimate of scaled-up product cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the current lack of useful, realistic feedback in commercially available bionic prosthetic devices. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide closed loop control through sensory feedback. Without this type feedback, prosthesis users tend to avoid manipulating certain objects because they run the risk of handling them incorrectly or destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research seeks to develop a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. The expected outcomes of this research are: a controller that can regulate both intensity and quality sensation and a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for day-to-day manipulation tasks. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million upper limb amputees worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enhance a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator, by integrating a control system that will be able to regulate both intensity and quality of sensation. The design and controller of this stimulator are unique.  The stimulator will integrate existing prosthetic hand systems. The sensation controller will modulate stimulation parameters to compensate for changes in measured resistance between the electrode-skin interface, thus reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The sensation controller will also maintain a consistent quality of sensation throughout usage. Upon completion of the Phase II project, the prosthetic technology will be a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address many of the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons that have, to date, prevented the widespread usefulness of this technology for targeted remote sensing applications. Traditional stratospheric balloons are massive and difficult to operate. They are often hundreds of feet tall, weigh thousands of pounds, costs tens of thousands of dollars, must be launched from fixed locations in near-perfect weather, and are always one-time use. These technical, operational, and financial limitations have led to a largely underutilized stratospheric environment. The first proposed research objective for this effort is the design completion of a small, mobile-launch, durable, and fully reusable altitude stable stratospheric balloon. The second research objective is the design and development of advanced balloon flight trajectory software needed to identify acceptable balloon launch sites that yield successful, targeted remote sensing missions. The third objective is the development of a rapid, mobile-launch platform. The project will culminate with a stratospheric flight test campaign that may demonstrate the combined system innovations, measured by the system’s overall ability to image pre-determined target areas of interest at specified times.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance stratospheric remote sensing technologies while enabling safe, routine, and commercially-viable Earth observation from a stratospheric balloon platform. The stratosphere is relatively void of commercial remote sensing activity, largely due to the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons. Today, stratospheric balloons are commercially unviable for remote sensing applications due to their inability to image specific areas of Earth at desired times, largely due to constraints associated with the need for fixed launch infrastructure, a lack of system directional control, and narrow operational launch windows requiring restrictive launch weather conditions. The novel stratospheric remote sensing balloon that is the subject of this effort may reduce or eliminate many of these constraints, resulting in a zero-emission, mobile-launch, precisely-placeable stratospheric remote sensing balloon that will enable high-resolution, targeted, low-cost Earth observation. This effort may enhance scientific and technological understanding of small stratospheric balloon systems for remote sensing applications and, most importantly, may enable widespread commercial usefulness of the stratosphere for remote sensing applications including remote, real-time wildfire monitoring and rapid, broad-area disaster response awareness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve standards for safety-critical connectivity of drones flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The drone communication market requires superior link reliability to BVLOS drone applications at an affordable price. The proposed technologies seek to control BVLOS operations enabling improved safety and increased trust in autonomous airspace systems from both regulatory authorities and society. Network-based solutions to improve airborne links require costly enhancements to the network and a large number of drone devices to be profitable. The team is focused on solving aerial command and control problems using the current mobile network; The technology seeks full integration with the 5G network and compatibility with subsequent network generations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and de-risk the connection reliability enhancement algorithms for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drones, enhancing connection reliability. The technological improvements allow use of any network generation (2G/3G/4G/5G), delivering connection reliability to 95% of the global population. The team has three enabling innovations: 1) voice channel communication redundancy which translates commands into audio signals transmitted over the voice channel, 2) an algorithm for handover (HO) optimization which minimizes ping-pong HO, radio link failures (RLF) and connection losses, and 3) safe route planning which allows drone operators to select the best route for reliable connectivity given the network circumstances.

    \ With 10x higher availability of bandwidth compared to the legacy sub-6 GHz spectrum,\
    \ mmWave enables faster connection speeds and is of significant focus in the telecommunication\
    \ industry. These applications have recently motivated Federal Communications\
    \ Commission (FCC) and other international counterparts to open several frequency\
    \ bands at mmWave spectrum for communication applications including 5G cellular,\
    \ wireless infrastructure, etc. Despite these advantages, the existing commercially\
    \ available mmWave front-end technologies are limited in their performance and\
    \ are not suitable for the emerging fixed and mobile access use cases of 5G mmWave.\
    \ To address this need, this project proposes a novel beamforming mmWave technology\
    \ that supports an order of magnitude higher aggregated throughput compared to\
    \ the existing mmWave wireless solutions and can serve as an enabler to a number\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel artificial intelligence technology that enables U.S. corn farmers to optimize nitrogen fertilizer applications based on field characteristics, rainfall and growing conditions. More efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer will reduce the carbon footprint of U.S. agriculture because more than 10% of the energy consumed in the U.S. agricultural sector goes toward the production of nitrogen fertilizer for corn. Because nitrogen fertilizer is a critical driver of both input costs and yield, this technology will improve the profitability of U.S. farmers by reducing input costs and maximizing corn yields. This project may enable corn production that creates less nitrogen fertilizer pollution, which threatens human health, degrades aquatic ecosystems and emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. A key social element of this project is a teaching module for middle-school science students that will blend content on soil science, agronomy, and crop management with the challenges faced by U.S. corn farmers to follow best management practices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using machine learning to evaluate the amount of yellowness on the lowest corn leaves visible in images taken from low-cost cameras mounted on ground robots. Characteristic yellowness on corn leaves is a strong indicator of stress caused by insufficient nitrogen, a key nutrient. A prototype neural network model will be iteratively improved, in part by dramatically increasing the available training imagery over the course of this Phase I project. Imagery will be collected on field trials set up across several Mid-Western states. Preliminary data suggest that the extent of characteristic yellowness is an indicator of accumulated nitrogen stress that is observable only under the canopy and not via airborne sensors. A commercially available nitrogen model will be used to estimate accumulated nitrogen stress across small plots created by manipulating the amount of added nitrogen fertilizer when corn is about 1-2 feet high. Tuning will occur by adjusting key model parameters through simulation until the differences are minimized between observed and modeled accumulated nitrogen stress across a field’s small plots. Parallel software development will improve prototype codes running simulations of a leading nitrogen model, enabling rapid model tuning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop autonomous, ocean-going cargo vessels powered by a combination of wind and solar power. These vessels will enable the provision of cheaper and more frequent sea freight service to isolated communities, such as those in coastal Alaska. The technology seeks to the lower operating costs by removing liquid or solid fuels or onboard crew, enabling the vessels to be more readily right-sized to particular routes and markets. The project may also have positive impacts on the environment by eliminating fossil fuel emissions and reducing marine noise impacts on wildlife, such as marine mammals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate existing robotic and energy capture technologies with newly developed wind/solar combined energy optimization software and autonomous contingency management. A vessel using both the wind and sun for propulsion has a difficult energy optimization problem, both on a minute-to-minute basis but also on the scale of an entire voyage; This project will build a model for solving this intermitancy problem given specific vessel performance characteristics and weather predictions. Likewise, this project will build a framework for addressing the autonomous contingency management problem for uncrewed marine surface vehicles given a particular set of vehicle and system characteristics. The focus will be on ship-to-shore communications contingencies because those are the most serious for the contemplated target system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enhance the understanding of wireless mesh networks and deep reinforcement learning algorithms in order to significantly expand the coverage and robustness, accelerating Internet of Things (IoT) adoption across the globe. These improvements to sensor systems seek to benefit a range of applications including public safety, smart agriculture, supply chain logistics, smart cities, wildlife monitoring, healthcare and other markets. The coverage and cost benefits are especially impactful for the U.S population in rural or economically-disadvantaged areas that lack cost effective connectivity and are unable to take advantage of the IoT benefits. Further, the project will enhance industry-academia partnership, enable the technology transition of innovations, and expand the participation of women in science, technology, enducation and mathematics (STEM).


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable scalable, longer-lasting, and higher-throughput Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) Internet of Things (IoT) networks by using LPWA IoT Mesh Augmentation (LIMA) devices to augment the connectivity between end-nodes and gateways in a cost-effective and easy-to-deploy manner. The mesh network of LIMA devices will adaptively multi-hop relay messages to maximize effective capacity and range. The teams seeks to augment the connectivity of LoRaWAN (a standard for Long Range Wide Area Networks) with a goal of increasing coverage range several-fold, reducing the battery drain of end-nodes, and enabling higher uplink bitrates. The core challenge for such LIMA is the development of a scalable multi-hop mesh routing protocol that, unlike existing protocols, accommodates the ultra-low bit rates that characterize LPWANs, and is generalizable across the diverse applications of LPWAN technology. The LIMA solution builds upon two synergistic innovations: (a) embedded-control routing, that uses a very small amount of bits in the data packet header in lieu of control packets, and thereby achieves scalability and energy-efficiency in ultra-low-capacity, energy-constrained networks and (b) relational deep reinforcement learning based routing that combines Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks (DeepRL) with the use of relational features to learn routing policies that adapt to a variety of link dynamics and traffic conditions. The LIMA solution does not require changes to end-nodes. The anticipated technical deliverables include mesh networking software, a simulation model, a 4-node prototype using a LoRa integrated circuit, and experimental analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reducing the cost of getting people online and connecting people in emergency situations such as natural disasters. Natural disasters often destroy cellular networks, exactly when people need communication the most. The influx of users on the limited remaining infrastructure often overwhelms existing resources, making it impossible for first responders to coordinate, for families to call their loved ones, and for volunteers to help. In other potential markets, the technology seeks to provide cellular phone access to parts of the world where it is now prohibitively expensive. This project seeks to develop small, portable cellular base stations that can provide access in both emergency and hard to reach and poorly resourced locations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project researches and implements a small, portable cellular base station. The technological focus for the base station utilizes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (or 2G and 2.5G) radio for communicating with a high density of cell phones in a computationally cheap manner while utilizing WiFi for local, high bandwidth applications. The technology implements many “micro-cells” in lieu of the current macro cell approach to cellular coverage, blanketing the area with a high number of towers. This decentralized approach provides high reliability even if one or several nodes fail. This project will develop the algorithms necessary for interconnecting large numbers of base stations together and mesh the networking capabilities that provide radio links between each base station. Finally, this project will finalize the mechanical design and make the base station manufacturable at large scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration with a new type of three-dimensional (3D) sensor. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate in densely crowded spaces in a safe and socially compliant/acceptable manner. A key potential outcome is the development of a collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).  This method would be capable of handling dense crowds and optimized to run on compact and power-efficient embedded processors. Such abilities would increase the commercial potential and adoption of learning-based navigation methods that have demonstrated excellent collision avoidance and noise handling capabilities. The technology may unlock commercial opportunities by deploying AMRs in the airport, retail, healthcare, and hospitality industries, where the environments are highly dense and dynamic. The airport industry may derive postive impacts from AMRs that can navigate in complex, indoor environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are not allowed by providing contactless deliveries of food, beverages, and other retail products to travelers at the gate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a hybrid collision avoidance approach enabling autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to operate safely in dense crowds, while being socially-compliant in sparse scenarios. Preliminary research has shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches can compute collision-free robot velocities with inaccurate, uncertain perception data. The proposed DRL-based model will be implemented as an optimized neural network that works on power and cost-efficient embedded processors.  The key technical hurdles in this technology are: the DRL model trained in simulation may not perform well in real-world environments (known as sim-to-real gap), the fully-trained DRL model may have some performance degradation compared to the company’s current DRL models due to the lower number of parameters used to run on embedded processors, and the localization modules could compute erroneous locations when the AMR is navigating through a dense crowd due to occlusions. The key objectives of Phase I are to address these challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the reduction of honey bee colony mortality by up to 75% through early identification and improved breeding of pest- and disease-resistant colonies. Honey bees are dying at unprecedented rates, with annual losses up to 45% in the United States. A primary cause of colony death is the parasitic mite Varroa. The unhealthy brood odor (UBO) assay is a pheromone-based tool that reduces labor costs required to measure Varroa-resistance by 18x, accelerating decision-making by 20%. The assay’s user-friendly design makes honey bee selection and queen evaluation more accessible to beekeepers, who are often restricted by the high technical skill and/or extensive labor required for existing assays. The UBO assay has potential to improve honey bee health and increase profitability of beekeeping operations, and thus may significantly improve global crop pollination and food security.

    The proposed project will assess the technical feasibility of using a honey bee pheromone-based assay to predict colony-level disease- and pest-resistance. This novel tool has the potential to improve honey bee health, revolutionize honey bee breeding, and inform important apiary management decisions, as it improves efficiency and efficacy of honey bee selection by enabling rapid and accurate identification of Varroa-resistant honey bee colonies. However, to be highly effective and achieve widespread uptake the technology must be practically and economically accessible, must perform consistently despite environmental variability, and must be established as a reliable indicator of heritable Varroa-resistance traits. The proposed research will employ sophisticated behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery, reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of Varroa-resistance traits identified by colony response to the prototype assay. Expected results include improvements to the safety and efficiency of the product delivery system, improved understanding of the effects of environmental variability on product performance, and confirmation of the heritability of traits identified by honey bee behavioral response to in-hive tests of the product.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve reuse of wastewater.  This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.

    The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities—by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is enhancing the role of metabolite (substances used by cells for growth, reproduction and health) analysis in the growing area of systems biology research. This is expected to lead to faster and less expensive biomarker and drug discovery to allow for more accurate, reproducible, and faster clinical trials, and to accelerate basic scientific research into many areas of cellular and system-wide organismal studies. This will have a significant impact on the bottom line for drug companies and for improving health and reducing health care cost. The innovation will provide customers with a platform and expertise that enable them to increase their ability to develop biomarkers and drugs faster by: (1) allowing more metabolites to be involved in the discovery of new relationships between diseases and metabolites, potentially opening up new areas of basic research; (2) selecting disease-associated metabolites on the basis of not only statistically significant changes in metabolite levels but also correlations of interactions among metabolites in diseased vs. healthy cells; and (3) evaluating the relationships between metabolites and diseases through integration of metabolite analysis with other system-wide analytical methods (i.e. gene expression, protein levels, etc.).

    The proposed project seeks to develop an innovative cloud-based platform with an interactive modular interface that allows users to easily build customized pipelines for analysis of untargeted metabolomics data. The platform will empower the opportunity to increase the number of annotated analytes and to integrate metabolomics with other omics data, thereby enhancing the involvement of metabolomics in systems biology-based biomarker and drug discovery studies. Despite a large accumulation of metabolomics data acquired over the past several years, effective use of these data for biomarker and drug discovery has been very limited. These challenges are in part due to the lack of effective tools that: (1) accurately determine the identity of disease-associated analytes; (2) help investigate the rewiring and conserved interactions among metabolites in the progression of disease; and (3) integrate multi-omics data to evaluate the relationship between metabolites and diseases at the systems level. This project will advance scientific knowledge by investigating and evaluating innovative computational methods for metabolite annotation, differential analysis of metabolite profiles, and multi-omics data integration. Furthermore, the project will lead to a cloud-based platform that enables users to build their desired data analysis workflow or pipeline by choosing from several innovative modules to analyze metabolomics data.

    The Broader Impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support widespread distribution and adoption of sterilizing biopesticides that are effective and efficient to control Lepidoptera. Lepidopterans, such as the corn earworm, circumvent insecticidal properties of certain crops by developing resistance.  Models show that incorporating sterile insects in a corn earworm population can suppress the incidence of resistant individuals in the populations.  Enhancing oral infectivity of this sterilizing insect biopesticide will improve product manufacturing, distribution and most importantly, ease of use to support farmer adoption.

    The proposed project develops a functional orally-infectious formula of a specific strain of the sexually-transmitted, sterilizing-virus, Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV2). The resulting technology will be suitable for prototyping and testing oral formulations for sterilizing adult corn earworm moths. Genetic selection and candidate gene approaches are proposed to improve stability of the virus entry complex required for oral infectivity. This project will decorate viral envelopes with genes absent from HzNV-2 and thereby improve virion stability.  The pseudotyped virus will be assayed for increased oral infectivity.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).  Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.  This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.

    The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.  The project will develop a test to measures a compound's biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a technology platform for storing biological materials that will improve public health outcomes and enable the storage of the ever-expanding digital data universe. Nucleic acids are the new bits of the 21st century; they encode our health and can be repurposed as alternative storage media for digital data. Harnessing the information encoded in these biological materials requires a scalable way to store and access nucleic acids. For decades, we have relied on energy-intensive low-temperature storage and expensive robotics to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids, which are not scalable. The successful outcome of this proposal is an alternative solution to store massive amounts of nucleic acids, obviating the need for freezers and enabling new products that leverage nucleic acid materials.

    The proposed project will lay the foundation for developing a low-cost scalable solution for nucleic acid materials. Current approaches are limited by the requirement of low temperature to circumvent the degradation of nucleic acids, requiring a constant supply of electricity and expensive robotics. Instead, the proposed project focuses on maintaining the integrity of nucleic acids for decades at room temperature and simultaneously enabling search and retrieval functions akin to a computer or internet search engine by leveraging the rapid diffusion of molecules in solution. This ambitious goal will be achieved by using novel synthetic polymers that are made compatible with biological materials to enable rapid encapsulation of nucleic acids while providing long-term protection without the need for low temperature. The resulting synthetic polymers discovered through the project will be tested using purified nucleic acids, including animal, bacterial, or viral genomes, to demonstrate the capabilities and breadth of materials that can be used for the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to commercialize a novel technology that enables compact, efficient, silent, reliable, and fuel-flexible power generation. Existing power solutions can lack endurance, reliability, and portability and often generate harmful emissions; or they are prohibitively expensive or incompatible with existing fuels and distribution infrastructure.  The power generation platform developed in this project has the potential to be a key enabling technology for the future rapid growth of commercial drone applications, which currently are often limited by the performance of lithium ion batteries. Drones are expected to make an impact across numerous industries including transport and delivery, power and utilities, telecommunications, and remote sensing. Additionally, this power generation technology can benefit industrial internet of things applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel power source that is easily portable and is compatible with existing fuel infrastructure. This project develops a system that converts most fuels to electricity via light; combustion heats a nanophotonic material to incandescence and the resulting light drives photovoltaic cells. The nanophotonic material is engineered to be spectrally matched to the photovoltaic cells, enabling efficient conversion. This technology can increase the endurance of drones or other systems up to ten times over batteries alone. This work is focused on cost reduction through new material development. The specific research objectives are to demonstrate a low-cost and scalable process for the nanophotonic material and photovoltaic cell while maintaining high performance, and then integrate and pilot the low cost system. Successful completion of these objectives will enable this technology to translate to drone applications with a compelling need for long-lasting portable power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a scalable carbon nanotube (CNT) production process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of the production process. This project will support domestic supply chains for CNT materials at potentially disruptively low cost-levels. There is market need for low cost CNTs to companies where replacement of existing additives with CNTs can lead to improved products at equivalent or lower cost. Two examples of this are in battery additives or tire additives, where CNTs can replace lower quality carbon black materials to break traditional materials trade-offs such as energy vs power density (batteries) or fuel efficiency vs lifetime (tires).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, sustainable electrochemical Carbon Nanotube (CNT) production technology, which uses CO2 and electricity to produce high quality CNT products that meet and exceed the quality metrics of today's market products, while feasibly offering a disruptively lower priced CNT product.  This project leverages experience in electrochemistry and carbon nanomaterials synthesis to develop rapidly scalable electrode architectures and preparation processes to fabricate such electrode architectures that enable the production of CNTs at cost structures that are truly disruptive in the marketplace and enable rapid commercialization.  To further complement these technical efforts, this project optimizes post-growth CNT processing to better align products for customer integration and utilization.  Finally, this work will demonstrate the commercial viability of the approach and a scaling pathway for the materials platform.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable wider adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across industries such as real estate, agriculture, construction, energy, entertainment, oil & gas, and journalism.  The project develops advanced UAV camera systems with seamless 360-degree imaging capabilities to increase flight time and the imaging capability. End users benefit from reduced labor demands and real-time high-fidelity images of remote areas otherwise inaccessible. Industrial inspections, crop management, field surveying, and site security are most often conducted by deploying humans into the field - often creating labor bottlenecks and potentially dangerous situations. Adoption of UAVs for these applications can be limited by image processing that consumes too much power for UAV use, delayed image presentation affecting navigation capabilities, or image artifacts that obscure the details pertinent to market needs.  These limitations can all be overcome with the camera technologies developed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a lightweight, parallax-free, 360-degree panoramic camera system with an innovative optical design based on a polyhedron-shaped configuration of adjacent cameras. Each camera's field of view closely abuts but does not overlap with the next, enabling seamless and computationally simplistic capture of images from 360-degree views, while limiting blind regions and lost content between cameras. This approach eliminates the stitching errors and image distortion associated with wide angle lenses and multi-camera systems, and reduces the computational demand for 360-degree image capture. As a result, low energy edge-computing presents images in real time with minimal impact on flight time or energy use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications. Furthermore, this project advances system designs optimized for UAV weight and size, as well as improved concepts for kinematic space frames, in which the cameras can be integrated to form robust multi-camera systems.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and\

    \ production is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:\
    \  Nutraceuticals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish,\
    \ and livestock, as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae\
    \ can be used as a feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from\

    \ its full commercial potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical\
    \ algal cultivation relies on high-density cell growth, this project will focus\
    \ on the science of low-density algal cultivation to achieve high productivity,\
    \ while minimizing process requirements for supplemental energy and concentrated\
    \ CO2.  In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with\
    \ emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily\
    \ replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the\

    \ production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges\
    \ in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and\
    \ increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research\
    \ activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications\
    \ for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order\
    \ to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus\
    \ design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;\
    \ 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the\
    \ need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder\
    \ to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the\
    \ basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the environment with cleaner diesel engine exhaust. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.  This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of an aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery that is a replacement for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries in stationary energy storage applications.  This battery has a nonflammable, environmentally-friendly, water-based electrolyte and does not utilize cobalt or nickel, reducing reliance on critical materials and helping to diversify battery material supply chains.  The battery chemistry combines the high safety and low cost associated with zinc-based batteries with the long life of lithium-ion batteries.  This aqueous battery may help to advance the adoption of beneficial energy technologies such as intermittent renewables and electric vehicles.  The battery utilizes zinc that can be sourced domestically and does not introduce a dependency on foreign sources, promoting both national security and the creation of US-based jobs.  The battery is also fully recyclable using existing methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery technology by focusing on optimization of individual battery components to improve cycle life and power as well as scale up from pouch cells to larger-format prismatic cells.  The research will include refining the intercalation electrode design to increase capacity retention during long life cycling, developing the zinc electrode design to suppress zinc dendrite growth, improving separator functionality to maintain high-rate capabilities and increase cycle life, and developing an electrolyte designed to stabilize zinc while also allowing for faster reactivity with the zinc and lithium ions.  Larger format cells with optimized components will be built and tested to evaluate scaled real-world performance metrics compared to Lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries traditionally used in stationary energy storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance energy sustainability, especially regarding estimation, understanding, and optimization of real-time grid carbon emissions. Decarbonizing the grid means reducing its carbon emissions by decreasing the emissions per unit of electricity generated. In-depth, accurate knowledge of real-time grid emissions will facilitate various grid decarbonization use cases and applications ranging from corporate carbon accounting, carbon-aware energy management, and new emission tracking standards to future electricity and carbon market design. More broadly, the prposed platform may demonstrate that achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reductions via co-optimization for costs and carbon is possible and provide a commercially viable, scalable path for policy makers, regulators, and corporations to meet their ambitious sustainability commitments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop novel and practical approaches to estimate, learn, and optimize real-time grid emissions. The Phase II project will optimize carbon estimation and forecast models, develop decision-making algorithms, implement the proposed methods as software, and validate the software platform through pilots. The team seeks to will build a user-friendly, cloud-based software platform with multiple applications that will enable climate regulators and sustainability directors to meet their public commitments and stay compliant with new regulations. Integrating real-time carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management is a critical challenge. Little is known about real-time carbon signals from the grid and the proposed project aims to demystify grid emissions to enable accurate, actionable, and transparent carbon tracking, reporting, and management.

The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the 'Internet-of-Things' vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures.

    The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of "things" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to more completely understand the real world through a perfect virtual copy. This SBIR Phase II project makes it possible to create virtual reproductions of real cities that not only show how the world looks, but reproduce every object and every detail perfectly, allowing users to interact with it. These virtual copies make it possible to quickly and effectively train soldiers and first responders, train autonomous ground and flying vehicles, place new construction into a dense city, simulate the effects of catastrophic weather, and explore imaginary scenarios through games. Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project addresses a paradox faced by ‘open web’ developers, users, and regulators: the use of centralized platform-creator hosted web portals to interact with an evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) application ecosystem. The proposed work will instrument a new open web paradigm that will improve user accessibility and ability to compose and perform data analysis on smart contracts. The approach will enable improvement of web-service reliability and security while weeding out bad actors.  Improving the accessibility and analysis of smart contracts is anticipated to help unlock further value and solutions across a range of applications and new business opportunities that can benefit from dynamic contracting.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build a blockchain-adjacent metadata model that enhances the utility and security of smart contracts for users and developers. The project will undertake the practical challenge of reverse-engineering smart contracts to outline a metadata model which will enhance discovery and security of services, creating a scaffold for composable apps. The approach will organize blockchain abstractions through code similarity analysis and program de-obfuscation by reverse engineering, instrument compile-time creation and publish metadata models by developers, and demonstrate how this data can be used to build a composable app user experience. The project will deploy privacy-preserving targeted advertising frameworks using deterministic services alongside the data from the metadata model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of lightweight, thermally safe batteries with high energy densities that can be charged fast, last a long time, are composed of environmentally benign materials, and can store energy at a low cost. Such batteries would enable the large-scale penetration of long-range electric cars and other electric vehicles, including airplanes and drones in transportation.  This process reduces environmental pollution and leads to greater energy efficiency.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to use boron nitride based layered ceramic materials as a means of storing electrochemical energy in solid state batteries.  This project enhances scientific and technological understanding on the design of advanced functional materials for energy storage at the atomic level.  To achieve the targeted high performance energy storage at the macroscopic level, the underlying material structures must be carefully selected on the atomic and molecular levels.  Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, may contain functional groups that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized and can be utilized as electroactive species in cathodes of rechargeable batteries. The great advantage of these materials is that they can realize simultaneously high energy and power density for thousands of charging/discharging cycles as demonstrated in graphene oxide batteries with lithium and sodium anodes.  Graphene oxide is, however, thermally unstable.  The project proposes to substitute graphene oxide with functionalized boron nitride in order to achieve thermal stability while preserving performance.  Furthermore, the functionalized boron nitride is also capable to play the role of a solid electrolyte in addition to being an electroactive species.  Particular focus will be made on synthesizing -OBF3 functionalized boron nitride. This functional group occurs as a Lewis adduct of surface oxides (such as graphene oxide or boron nitride oxide) with BF3 (an electrolyte component) and is particularly promising as a compact electroactive species and electrolyte.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    \ learner engagement but also facilitates retention of information. While music\
    \ has long been recognized for its mnemonic properties and is widely used as a\
    \ memory aid in the context of early childhood learning (e.g., the ABC song),\
    \ music-based educational products for the broader K-12 market are less pervasive.\
    \ This project focuses on the optimization of musical structures to support effective\
    \ and engaging mathematics instruction. The goal of this project is to offer music\
    \ as a credible pedagogical tool. Specifically, this project offers music as a\
    \ learning medium that can be used beyond rote memorization and instead teach\
    \ mathematical skills, processes, and procedures in an engaging manner that makes\
    \ math accessible to all learners. Mathematical fluency is a critical skill in\
    \ a society that continues to become more technological; it also creates broader\

    \ \n\n\nThe proposed research features two innovations: 1) optimization of learning-based\
    \ musical forms based on distinct mathematical information types; and 2) creation\
    \ of a non-linear, dynamic platform to deliver the content. Using computational\
    \ musicology techniques as well as experimental studies, the first innovation\
    \ involves creation of mathematically accurate music videos based on unique creative\
    \ and structural parameters that are determined by the type of mathematical information\
    \ being taught. The second innovation focuses on delivery of the music-based content\
    \ and involves significant technical and creative investigation to produce a dynamic,\
    \ non-linear mechanism for presenting the material in a manner that still feels\
    \ continuous and compelling to the student. Together, both innovations underlie\
    \ a synergistic learning solution designed for premium learner engagement and\
    \ to support self-paced, adaptive learning. This project will result in high quality,\
    \ digital math instruction that is accessible to all learners through use of effective,\
    \ engaging, and relevant instructional methods. The desired outcomes are eliminating\
    \ proficiency gaps in math education and achieving equity in students' educational\
    \ success.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed\
    \ worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit\
    \ and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address the lack of advanced maps of shallow water zones, or littoral zones, crucial to global ecology and economy.  An estimated 70% of the world's littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands with scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely.  Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence for amphibious landings and accurate assessment of the environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development. The resulting geospatial products will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite-derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different physical parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval to form complementary measurements. Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.  Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metaocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation; and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.  The shallow seafloor is a dynamic and poorly understood domain due to the complexity of the environment and navigational dangers of accessing unknown waters. The project's goal is to create a remotely produced, automated, self-validating satellite-based shallow seafloor mapping system by implementing artificial intelligence, advanced remote sensing and computer science algorithms and ongoing collection of earth observation imagery to globally produce 10-30 m resolution bathymetry elevation models.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide an efficient, automated biopsy diagnostic process which will allow patients to access high quality cancer diagnostics at lower cost and without being subjected to unnecessary and painful repeat procedures from inefficient biopsy processes. The innovation addresses a critical global need to improve the efficiency and analytics of biopsies. An automated, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) system will potentially eliminate the 20% fail-rate of fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy sampling. The application may also be scaled to provide a solution to facilities that may not be able to afford the rapid onsite evaluation service of FNA.

    The proposed project aims to provide an automated, rapid on-site evaluation process by leveraging a system-engaging technology and robotics to increase fine needle aspiration biopsy sampling efficiency and improve patient experience, while reducing costs to ensure accessibility to all facilities. This device will have three processes to produce an image-ready glass slide that a pathologist can access remotely and render an adequacy assessment. The device will perform smearing, staining, and image capture of a fine needle aspiration biopsy sample. Normally, these processes are performed by a pathologist/cytotechnologist, making rapid on-site evaluation service inaccessible to fine needle aspiration providers in most rural or small facilities. With an automated device, the rapid on-site evaluation service may be mroe readily available and accessible at a fraction of cost, saving time and resources for patients and medical providers.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a wound care product to heal bed sores or pressure ulcers (PUs). Over 2.5 million Americans, usually older adults, suffer from PUs annually. PUs can be deep wounds, take many months to heal, cause significant pain; if infected, they can lead to sepsis and death. The annual U.S. cost for treatment of all PUs is estimated to be greater than $11 billion. Current treatment options involve surgical reconstruction with skin or skin substitute grafts, which can fail to heal the pressure ulcer because of infection or because the graft was not strong enough. To address these issues, the proposed project will develop a novel skin substitute that is pro-regenerative, stronger, and releases infection-fighting drugs at the surgical site to allow healing. This could benefit physicians and hospitals treating patients with stage II-III PUs (58% of all PUs); the 3-year market potential is over $150 million. The underlying technology of the proposed solution can be used to make novel grafts for treatment of numerous wound types, improving healing and patient quality of life.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of this drug-loaded, polymer-impregnated acellular biologic graft (ABG) platform technology. Currently, PUs are surgically reconstructed using skin or skin substitute grafts, like ABGs, which often fail due to infection or lack of mechanical strength. By embedding a polymer hydrogel within an ABG, it can be mechanically strengthened. Furthermore, mixing the polymer with drugs (drug+polyABG) enables a drug delivery system that provides sustained, local release of therapeutic agents such as anti-infectives over a 14-day period. This novel approach simultaneously provides an allogeneic scaffold for patient-mediated tissue regeneration and counters onset of common complications during wound healing. This biocompatible polymer impregnation of ABGs for therapeutic applications has not been performed previously. This Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility drug+polyABG by (1) characterizing drug release and bioactivity in vitro and (2) assessing efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of single-stage reconstruction of stage II-III PUs challenged with topical MRSA.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content is commonly limited to very short clips (typically < 10 seconds) due to huge file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices. both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment and telecommunications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable. The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time. There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard HD video content.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of semiconductor chips.  Specifically, it develops a novel method to operate directly on compressed data, saving time, energy, and latency.  This improved performance will affect computationally intensive applications such as medical imaging (e.g., CT/MRI), climate simulation, hurricane warnings, and earthquake alerts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a method to operate on compressed data. Today, computers apply data compression to identify and remove redundancy in the data in order to save storage space.  Computers apply arithmetic to compute in integers or real numbers (usually represented internally as floating-point data).  However, today's computers first decompress the data, compute, and then compress the computed result, consuming additional time and energy.  This project develops an arithmetic and math hardware accelerator capable of processing compressed data directly to dramatically improve computation performance, storage effectiveness, and energy efficiency.  This project combines data compression and floating-point engineering to deliver the first-ever Compressed Floating-Point Unit (CFPU) that minimizes semiconductor and energy usage and reduces computation latency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safe, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy storage solution.  This project offers a non-chemical, non-hazardous alternative energy storage to accelerate grid modernization and non-polluting renewable power integration.  The project’s core technology is a design that is cost competitive with deployed Lithium ion (Li-ion) chemical batteries, but would be significantly less expensive per charge than Li-ion over its 30+ year service life.  This proposed approach allows the long-term advantages of kinetic (flywheel) energy storage (low service life costs, high power throughput, high daily charge cycles, no battery replacements, potential for 24/7 operations) and makes it affordable and safer for deployed stationary grid operations. With solar and wind renewables on par with traditional carbon-based power generation costs, affordable flywheel energy storage is vital to store and dispense intermittent renewable power, enabling the replacement of carbon-based power generation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a comprehensive testing effort to verify the technical feasibility of the project’s 3D flywheel composite structure for next-generation energy storage systems. The proposed research and testing objectives are to demonstrate the improved 3D flywheel performance and projected 9x reduction in the traditional flywheel weight for the same energy storage capability. Testing methodology includes dynamic balancing, torque transmission determination, critical failure/fatigue modeling, assessing magnetically coupled commercial external motor/generator power transmission and performance in a TRL-5 operational vacuum environment. The effort will also include energy storage market analysis for commercial market entry based on tested 3D flywheel performance. Anticipated results include the characterization of the 3D flywheel structural technology, demonstrated commercial subsystem operations and readiness to develop a full prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to improve the assessment of cognitive and motor skills in K-6 students. More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the introduction of non-flammable, easy-to-manufacture solid battery electrolytes that are also compatible with lithium metal. The cell architecture seeks to ensure safety while enabling a significant improvement in the energy density.  The teams also seeks to lower the costs of the lithium-ion batteries by eliminating extrinsic costs associated with thermal management and explosion containment.  Safe, easy-to-manufacture electrolytes may alter the rate of electrification of the global economy. The next generation of battery powered medical devices, a large proportion of which are manufactured in the United States, may also benefit from the adoption of the new solid electrolyte. In addition, the proposed composite solid electrolyte aims to enable new cell architectures with significantly higher energy densities than what has been possible in liquid electrolyte systems to date.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a non-flammable, high-conductivity composite, solid-state battery electrolytes that are compatible with mixed metal oxide cathode chemistries and cell manufacturing processes. The morphology of the composite electrolyte is such that it offsets disadvantages present in polymer electrolytes, as well as inorganic sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes, when they are used as monolithic materials. The unique heterostructures of the proposed solid electrolytes advance the current state-of-the-art by enabling faster diffusion of lithium ions through multiple pathways, while mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte's nonflammable nature makes it a potential replacement for conventional liquid electrolytes in reducing fire hazards and reducing the costs of reqired thermal protection systems in lithium-ion batteries. The compatibility with lithium metal presents a unique opportunity for improvement in the energy density over currently used silicon-graphite anodes, that translates to a lower cost per unit of stored energy ($/kWh). An additional advantage is that these batteries do not require special handling and they are compatible with both spiral wound and planar battery form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to facilitate access to banking services through use of blockchain/distributed ledger technology, even with limited internet access. The proposed technology can make transfers more affordable and convenient. Digitizing transfers increases speed, reduces exchange and transfer fees, and lowers the risk associated with carrying cash.  This proposed technology enables access for the 13 million people currently underserved by the financial industry.  If successful, this technology could improve efficiency and resilience of transfers worldwide. The project's anticipated results include 60% cost reduction compared to traditional transfer systems, <30 second transaction completions, and an anticipated 0% fraud rate.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research and develop a blockchain-based solution to store, send, and make transfers without a smartphone or internet. The proposed core technology includes a blockchain back-end that powers an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) front-end, allowing mobile devices to securely send and receive data without an internet connection. This project’s intellectual merit lies in (1) developing the first-of-its-kind blockchain-based system for international transactions with access even in low bandwidth/no bandwidth environments; (2) creating a digital identity protocol that is distributed, accessible offline, and usable by any entity without exposing personally identifiable information (PII); and (3) developing the first machine learning-based microlending algorithms using offline behaviors to predict, prompt, and automate actions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the performance of flat panel displays of various form factors and sizes.  One of the key subsystems of a flat panel display is a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) backplane that drives the pixels in the panel.  There are increasing demands for improved resolution and frame rate in displays, posing significant challenges on the performance of the TFT backplane.  The proposed STTR research will produce TFT devices that are several orders of magnitude faster using existing semiconductor materials.  This technology will lead to more capable solutions for displays, printed electronics, and internet-of-things applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a novel Thin Film Transistor (TFT) design for displays and other electronics that require transistors.  Conventional TFT transistors switch current laterally and are difficult to reduce below micron-level sizes.  The proposed research will produce TFT transistors that switch current vertically.  The path length across which the switching occurs is much shorter in the vertical devices and therefore the switching happens faster and can carry more current than conventional designs.  This project develops a vertical TFT using amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductors.   The project will advance the development of a prototype vertical TFT.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to enhance the health of livestock without addition of synthetic antibiotic and antioxidant compounds. The proposed technologies are corn kernel fiber byproducts of ethanol production from corn. The need for such compounds has grown as livestock is now more often raised in concentrated animal feeding operations that confine animals and result in abnormal oxidative stress. The program is based on extracting these naturally occurring compounds from agricultural residues.  These extracts can be used in place of antibiotics and synthetic supplements currently in livestock feeds.  The process proposed will enable production at a cost competitive with synthetic supplements.

    This STTR project proposes to assess the biological activity of hydroxy cinnamic acids and their oligomers (HCAs) as beneficial supplements in livestock feed. They are ester-linked to a hemicellulose known to occur in seed crop brans. The linkage is hydrolyzed during pretreatment of corn bran fiber to prepare it for conversion to ethanol and the HCAs dissolve in the pretreatment solution. As free acids they recover their character, which includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The project will provide kilogram quantities of HCAs for use in feeding trials with young swine, wherein they will be compared with naturally sourced feed supplements currently in use in Europe, as well as un-supplemented feed. Components of the extract will be identified and comprehensive biochemical analyses performed, including study of the gastrointestinal physiology and intestinal permeability. Studies will also be performed of gut microbiomes and how the processes involved are influenced by substitution of HCAs as the primary feed supplement. Successful completion of these studies will provide a basis for more comprehensive studies of the use of HCAs as supplements in the diet of other livestock.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide open and secure management of transactions between multiple parties in a supply chain. The lack of transparent information throughout the supply chain has eroded the trust and value of many perishable products and the brands they represent. The proposed project addresses the current issue of tracking and traceability of food products in a trusted manner. Through the development of a hybrid blockchain that is sensor aware, all the parties involved in the distribution of the goods will ensure that the food quality is maintained by entering transactions into a secure blockchain. The result is two-fold: consumers will be assured that they are getting the right goods and suppliers can trust that their products are being delivered with quality. While initially focused on the $2 billion food transaction market, the commercial potential will expand to a broader range of products that require secure traceability including consumer goods, home delivery and medical products.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the core technology for the hybrid blockchain and test the functionality in a live commercial setting. The technology represents the first-in-class solution that leverages blockchain and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with integrated sensor and hybrid datasets to address the perishable nature of food products. The blockchain model will assume that a transaction is an event of data transfer and that there can be many disjointed events even on a small-scale supply chain network. For traceability, novel algorithms will be designed, making it feasible to connect disjointed events using geometry and a pseudo-Boolean function on top of a system that assigns a unique code. This implementation uses multivariate time series and node features for the meaningful aggregation and disaggregation of datasets, such as data collected by sensors and participating members. Putting such multivariate time series on the graph where participants are nodes with their pairwise relations as edges, the technology will address the novel optimization problem for efficient real-time monitoring and assist in providing further assurance of transaction integrity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes providing a high-throughput system for recycling critical metals like cobalt to reduce the conventional energy-intensive mining and refining processes used to produce materials for manufacturing today. Most importantly, this project will help secure a supply of critical materials, reducing the United States’ reliance on foreign supply chains and guaranteeing a secondary source of battery materials. A new, domestic supply will also reduce the social and human health impacts associated with artisanal mining, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to (1) validate novel electro-extraction nanotechnology based separations technology in the battery recycling and cobalt mining space, and (2) validate a new, value-added product (a battery cathode precursor material) for this rapidly growing market, rendering the conventional refining stages unnecessary.   The proposed electroextraction process utilizes flow-through water electrolysis to produce high local concentrations of hydroxide to precipitate transition metals as metal hydroxides.  This understanding will allow tuning the device operating conditions for metal or mixed-metal specific precipitation, for example, the precipitation of Ni-Mn-Co hydroxides at battery stoichiometries or highly selective precipitation of individual metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project improves the use of large-scale databases, data warehouses, and the software that used to commercially data-mine these resources.  In the era of big data, many applications, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, critically rely on data functionalities including efficiency, interoperability, and analysis. However, their data subsystems are challenged to meet these needs due to multiple technical limitations, such as centralized storage, homogeneous data formats, and tightly coupled workflows. This STTR project will develop a new framework to overcome these limitations to improve big data applications in various scientific fields, such as biological sciences, astronomy, and computational chemistry.  At the end of this Phase I project, the requisite knowledge and foundational materials for developing a blockchain-based data warehousing middleware will be produced.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to advance the specific knowledge and commercialization of DLTs (Distributed Ledger Technologies) and blockchains by creating novel and innovative environments for further development for DLTs and blockchains as a "virtuous cycle", starting with bottlenecks identified in modern data warehouses. The DLT tool developed here advances blockchain protocols, specifically for removing quadratic and speculative costs from orthodox protocol-based approaches to blockchains on conventional hardware and instituting linearizable and constant costs with other innovative programming methods (e.g., probabilistic pruning). New statistical, topological, and computational approaches will be researched and developed for these purposes, including for development of techniques applicable for machine learning, artificial intelligence, peta-scale and exa-scale computing, advanced scientific computing, and pedagogical academic development of future generations. The expected results include a new set of protocols and a unified tool for integrating data types and multiple networks into conventional data warehouses, especially for advancement of data warehouses struggling to keep pace with new blockchain data, metadata, and real-time analytics.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address fire and explosion safety hazards associated with lithium ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage technologies. Fueled by growth in the energy storage and electric vehicle industries, the Li-ion battery market is expected to grow to a size of several hundred billion dollars by 2025. Future viability of these clean energy technologies are dependent on Li-ion battery technology. However, Li-ion batteries occasionally catastrophically fail, posing thermal hazards as serious as fires and explosions.  The proposed technology has the potential to be an effective, low cost solution and accelerating adoption of transformative clean energy technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the safety of Li-ion bateries. Under certain scenarios, Li-ion batteries can fail, resulting in an exothermic release of flammable and toxic gases. For applications including large multi-cell battery systems in energy storage and vehicle use, the risk of thermal runaway can result in catastrophic fires, explosions and toxic gas release that can damage nearby infrastructure and cause injury or death. Thermal runaway poses significant challenges for available suppression and mitigation systems because the hazardous gas release can continue despite suppression of the incipient fire. The proposed thermal runaway protection and suppression technology addresses the source of the hazards by exploiting a series of novel physio-chemical processes to reduce flammable and toxic gas species concentrations released during a thermal runaway event.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will significantly lower the initial cost of residential and commercial ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems used in space heating and cooling applications. GSHPs are inherently more energy efficient than most heating and cooling technologies. This technology will accelerate electrification of the US economy, lessen the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels, reduce peak electricity demand, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. GSHPs operate quietly and reliably, provide humidity control, and can provide both heating and cooling, greatly increasing the comfort of building environments and quality of life. GSHPs can also reduce and levelize utility bills in low-income housing and enhance the ability to provide energy assistance programs to those in need.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further develop a novel technology that will overcome barriers in the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The project’s chief technical objectives are to improve tools and knowhow relating to the application of the proposed novel in-ground heat exchanger technology and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this technology in real-world applications in targeted geographical markets. Specifically, the project will further refine the computational modeling tools used to size heat exchanger systems; and develop and integrate sophisticated geospatial data sets that these models will use/ This will result in more accurate and more rapid heat exchanger sizing on a site-specific basis. Next, the project will validate these tools through extended testing and data collection on a prototype system installed on a home system. Finally, this project will apply these tools during the deployment of three commercial systems in targeted geographic markets and collect additional data regarding their performance over time.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve lowering the barrier to adoption of renewable energy generation and energy storage. The project seeks to take advantage the sheer abundance and low costs of sodium materials compared to state-of-the-art lithium materials. This will reduce upfront energy storage cost and in turn the payback time and costs of electricity for end users can be significantly reduced. The United States has 23 billion tons of domestic sodium reserves, which makes up 88% of the global supply of sodium. Successful utilization of the vast U.S. sodium reserves in new battery technologies will significantly reduce import reliance of critical materials and alleviate supply chain limitations on lithium-based materials. This project will accelerate the adoption of solar and renewable energy generation, making the grid cleaner, more sustainable, and more resilient.

    This research project advances new batteries enabled by a novel halide-based sodium solid state electrolyte. The technology offers several beneficial properties compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries: enhanced safety due to the use of completely nonflammable materials, higher volumetric energy density by using a dense alloy-based anode, lowered costs due to the abundance of sodium-based raw materials, and improved longevity from the use of superior halide-based solid-state electrolytes. Unlike the commonly used sulfide-based or oxide-based solid electrolyte materials, the halide-based innovation provides enhanced electrochemical and chemical stability while eliminating the need for high temperature sintering during fabrication. This project develops the halide solid electrolyte material, improving its baseline material ionic conductivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, as well as exploring scalable synthesis routes using single-step fabrication at room temperature.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new class of batteries for transportation. The proposed battery design will maximize the rate of charge and battery lifetime while maintaining high energy density, in contrast with current battery research that primarily focuses on maximizing energy density. This new operating parameter will open the design space for smaller batteries that result in lighter weight, lower cost and longer life vehicle platforms to enable all-electric transportation. In addition, the new operating parameters enable the widespread adoption of two new applications, (i) vehicle to grid and (ii) mobility as a service. The associated reduction of greenhouse gases will be 1+ gigaton annually.

    The proposed project develops a lithium battery coin cell that demonstrates 3 minutes ultrafast charge and 20,000 extended cycle life performance, using the novel disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode. This project explores ultrafast charge lithium ion battery platforms.  Technical objectives include: 1) charging times comparable to filling up today's gas tanks; 2) batteries with a higher safety profile that last the entire service life of the vehicle; 3) vehicles that can connect to the electric grid for renewables integration.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.

    The SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project improves inventory management.  An estimated $818 billion is lost annually due to incomplete knowledge of a company’s inventory.  The problem occurs because of the absence of a label at manufacturing that survives through the supply chain (retail, logistics, and end user). Currently, traditional supply chain management forces a company to add at least one new tag at each step. This project will reduce the number of tags per product, exponentially decrease waste, increase supply chain efficiency, and prevent knockoffs or counterfeits from being added to the supply chain. All of this will help businesses run more effectively, better serve customers, and enable consumers to gain detailed knowledge of their purchases.

    The intellectual merit of this project is development of the first commercially viable, cradle-to-grave inventory tag through optimization and scalability tasks. The innovation is a chipless inventory tag with a unique serial number for every product to provide the cradle-to-grave functionality. The underlying Material Adjusted Signature Tag (MAST) technology uses printable materials to create a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. The MAST tags will enable direct printing or application of a tag onto a product, allowing an efficient way to reliably identify, track, and attribute data to a product throughout its life. This project will improve the tag’s data potential, optimize manufacturability, and achieve greater readability. Beyond optimization and scalability milestones, this project will test the tags, readers, and manufacturing equipment in relevant environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of automatically refocusing reading glasses for wide adoption by the two billion people with presbyopia, a common form of vision loss with age that prevents focusing on nearby objects. Current presbyopia corrections, such as reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses, are unwieldy or unnatural solutions that fail to perfectly replace healthy vision. An automatically refocusing system will provide an attractive alternative by restoring natural vision, such that objects are brought into focus according to where the user looks. With a lightweight and robust implementation for all-day use, such a system will be poised for wide translation to address a ubiquitous cause of decreased productivity and quality of life for billions worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop key technologies leading to the miniaturization of the automatically refocusing glasses. Existing systems address only the highest performance implementations of full 3D gaze estimation for demanding applications like VR or AR, and they are too power-hungry and large for automatically refocusing reading glasses. This project will develop a customized hardware and software system for novel depth-estimation specific to this application. The project will explore the trade space of weight, power consumption, and form factor to develop an optimal parameter set.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance a novel, reusable, intermittent, urinary catheterization system from a functional prototype to the final production-equivalent device. By progressing the system through additional design improvements and FDA submission, the goal of this project is to enable the product to reach the hands of individuals who require intermittent catheters to urinate. Current intermittent urinary catheter use is fraught with complications including frequent urinary tract infections, expensive supplies, and large material footprints, as well as the generation of a significant amount of plastic waste. This project seeks to improve the current catheter landscape by allowing for commercialization of a reusable catheter system that will reduce contact contamination during insertion, reduce plastic waste, and enable widespread use of high-quality urinary catheters by decreasing the per-use cost. Through these improvements, healthcare costs associated with intermittent catheterization can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, based on frequent interactions with individuals who catheterize and suffer from impaired dexterity, the design of the system will incorporate the needs and ideas of people who are often ignored during innovation within the current catheterization space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will finalize the design of a novel, reusable, intermittent urinary catheterization system and portable reprocessing device as well as advance the system towards commercialization. Intermittent urinary catheterization is a technologically static field that has not changed significantly since the 1970s, with minimal improvements in urinary tract infection risk, supply cost, and environmental waste reduction. While the associated SBIR Phase I project established proof-of-concept catheter reprocessing, the Phase II project will include optimization and more advanced microbiologic efficacy testing. This assessment will focus on specifically addressing concerns regarding lubrication and compactness brought up during SBIR Phase I customer discovery activities, as well as multiple reuse reprocessing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase access to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Over 554,000 kidney failure patients in the US require some form of dialysis each year but only 58,000 receive PD, despite its lower cost of care. Despite the many benefits and advantages of PD compared to in-center dialysis, adoption is limited due to the risk of peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneal membrane. Peritonitis occurs in nearly 30% of PD patients each year and is responsible for the death of 1 out of every 6 patients who receive PD. The proposed device significantly and broadly reduces the risk of peritonitis, resulting in nearly $2 billion in Medicare savings and improved clinical outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop a medical device that internally disinfects catheter tubes in a closed system. This innovative disinfection method is designed to prevent microbial infection threats during peritoneal dialysis. The aim will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disinfection prototype, including evaluations of its ease of use. The technology will be designed to meet medical device design and safety standards. The project will perform optimization studies, develop cGMP-ready manufacturing processes, and develop an advanced prototype.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve capacitor technology in power conversion equipment used to electrify our transportation systems. Capacitors are critical components to the systems needed to accelerate the energy transition from petroleum to other fuels. This project will develop new electrical materials and production processes for capacitors. The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles. Through development of these new electrode materials and processes, manufacturing of capacitors in the United States will be available to serve the growing US electric vehicle industry.

    This goal of the proposed work is to develop electrode materials and roll-to-roll processes compatible with an integrated, continuous manufacturing process for multilayer capacitor products. By combining additive manufacturing process in a roll-to-roll system, sequential deposition, drying, and curing of alternating layers of dielectrics and electrodes will enable production of multilayer capacitors in a single system at atmospheric pressure. Electrode inks and printing processes used in flexible/hybrid electronics do not meet the specifications to replace vacuum-based evaporation or sputtering of thin electrode layers for capacitor applications. The primary approach will be based on adapting the layer coating and alignment techniques developed for dielectrics to conductive materials. These electrode materials will improve upon state-of-the-art conductive inks with poor interfaces between particles to produce dense layers with uniform thickness and low surface roughness. This project seeks to provide prototyping of multilayer capacitors produced in discrete processing steps for verification of electrical performance.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    \ Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation\
    \ is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer\
    \ from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional\

    \  Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects\
    \ during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode\

    \ electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.\
    \  The proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    \ many organisms that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require\
    \ energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are\
    \ capable of being engineered in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink\
    \ formulations that are safe, renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will\
    \ be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other\
    \ printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease\
    \ significantly the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment,\
    \ and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes\
    \ to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria as feedstock for\
    \ producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project will also\
    \ engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments for a color\
    \ spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria will act\
    \ as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,\
    \ such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process\
    \ in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and\
    \ reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source\
    \ of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,\
    \ wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly\
    \ generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria\
    \ strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink\
    \ products for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of\
    \ these natural pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to serve the breast cancer community. In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this project centers on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals suffering from motor dysfunction due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and other conditions. In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks. Additional results include increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and turn-over.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of exoskeleton robots targeted at rehabilitation. A substantial portion of the US population requires intensive rehabilitation services for neuromuscular impairment. Robotic rehabilitation has attracted attention due to the potential for better patient outcomes. Current robotic solutions lack the anatomical mobility and compliant dynamic behavior to produce neurologically-sound therapeutic behaviors. The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior. In this project, the physical structures and control algorithms of the exoskeletons will be designed and built with a focus on dynamic transparency and kinematic compatibility with the human body to capitalize on the capabilities of the actuator. Additionally, the control software will use feedback loops and a visually interactive environment with performance metrics to keep patients engaged.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to address a significant pain point for farmers associated with reducing nitrogen fertilizer input costs. The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer.  These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies ultimately in saving lives. This project proposes a Machine Learning-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) firearms detection system for law enforcement. Implementation of this technology would significantly reduce the cognitive burden of police officers in dangerous situations, allowing for more informed decisions. Additionally, there are benefits to the warfighter and security professionals to improve their capabilities in keeping the nation and public safe. Successful implementation and commercialization of a firearms detection system will grant capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data to find insights previously unknown, and to provide a data-driven approach towards real-time reactions around firearms and firearm usage.

    The proposed project aims to research and develop a Machine Learning-enabled, integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm activity, such as discharges and unholsters. The challenges are two-fold: 1) to develop and iterate based on pilot user feedback regarding the hardware and software portions of the system; and 2) to employ machine learning on a unique dataset for insights on firearms knowledge and handling. The proposed research and development plan calls for pilots with several law enforcement agencies, hardware and software iterations based on user feedback, and research into a real-life dataset collected by police officers.

    \ Mobile data usage has been experiencing exponential growth, 92% CAGR from 2006-2016.\
    \ Current mobile infrastructure cannot support next generation applications like\

    \ fast layer switching and ultra-low-loss waveguides for creating highly adaptable,\
    \ tunable true time delays and detailed characterization of interfering signals\
    \ in complex, dynamic multi-path reflection environments in cable and wireless\
    \ solutions. The 3D PIC system aims to achieve under this project: total interference\
    \ cancellation of >100 dB; small die footprint for a multi-tap cancellation FIR\
    \ filter; high-speed switching; demonstration of full duplex communication links;\
    \ and demonstration of band leakage and PIM interference cancellation in a laboratory\
    \ environment. The improved designs will allow targeting additional markets in\
    \ wireless communication involving complex interference cancellation scenarios\
    \ that today severely limit spectrum utilization and network throughput. The proposed\
    \ 3D PICs not only enable full duplex operation (co-channel self-interference)\
    \ but also adjacent channel cancellation (guard band elimination) and passive\
    \ intermodulation distortion (PIM) cancellation for higher throughput backhaul.\n\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce injuries and costs due to overexertion and heat strain in firefighting through a real-time, biometric monitoring system and accompanying analysis tools. This system collects each firefighter's vital signs and sends the data to authorized commanders for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, commanders can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Almost 60% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year, and associated costs total over $7 billion annually.  The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve other first responders, such as military personnel, industrial workers, and others with occupational risk.

    The proposed project will improve the occupational safety of first responders through the research and development of the following components:  1) An improved biometric collection wearable; 2) software used by the biometric monitoring system; 3) a location-monitoring tool; 4) algorithms to estimate sleep quality, fatigue, and detect symptoms for certain diseases, and improve exertion and core-body temperature estimates. 5) network improvement solutions allowing first responders in remote areas to utilize biometric monitoring tools. All five objectives will consist of multiple pilot studies with ongoing research and development that will incorporate crucial feedback from end-users. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for partnering fire and emergency services.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is addressing the critical societal need to remediate toxic organic pollutants in soils and sediments. The proposed technology would enable environmental goals to be met on many contaminated sites whose remediation is currently limited by high costs. The technology would contribute to the re-development of many billions of dollars in real estate by returning properties to productive and appropriate use. The hybrid bacterial augmentation and thermal technology provides a model for additional systems with other bacteria uniquely suited to applications in emerging contaminants and water treatment.

    This project proposes to commercialize a bacterial treatment for the degradation of organic contaminants of concern in environmental matrices such as soils and sediments. The thermally-enhanced bioaugmentation technology evaluated in Phase I is based on a novel bacterial strain and its enzymes that function at elevated temperatures and are capable of degrading a variety of ring based, organic pollutants, including chlorinated forms difficult to remediate. Pilot tests on soils contaminated with Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) demonstrated degradation for both TPH and for the heavier poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PaHs) on the EPA's list of priority pollutants. Phase II goals are to expand these initial studies to the full commercial scale of 100s to 1000s of tons of soil by working with established environmental engineering firms with extensive experience in thermal treatments of large volumes. To fully commercialize this new technology, the production capacity for the biological agents also will be scaled up by over an order of magnitude. The technology will be applied both ex-situ and in-situ as the process evolves.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology that will improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in combatting the U.S. illegal drug epidemic, which contributed to over 67,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. An affordable, effective field drug test system, superior to conventional color test kits and Raman-based test systems, would address this challenge, particularly because the widely used color test kits are outdated, hazardous, and susceptible to a high false positive rate. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit data analysis that will help LE reduce the supply of dangerous drugs from the communities they serve. This innovation has the potential to expand into other markets, including medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a novel system for on-site presumptive drug testing and collection of drug intelligence for LE. Conventional color tests are inaccurate and highly flawed, often resulting in failure to accurately detect common drugs and novel drug analogues as they are introduced into the illegal substance market. Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative method to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). UGIB results in more than 550,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone with a mortality rate of up to 20%. The gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding market is projected to be nearly USD 1 billion by 2026, with the overall hemostatic agents market reaching over USD 5 billion. Current solutions require endoscopy performed by a specialist or hospital admission. The proposed approach is a drinkable formulation to stop bleeding after ingestion, eliminating the need for endoscopic intervention or hospitalization. The technology developed in this project could then be applied to other bleeding scenarios, including field/combat medicine or rapid treatment of hemorrhage during surgical complications. The gel can also be used as a drug delivery vehicle for a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new approach to achieve hemostasis in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), based on a novel thermosensitive gel (thermogel) formulation. The drinkable formulation is liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a mucoadhesive gel when warmed to body temperature, thereby treating hemorrhage in the upper GI tract without the need for endoscopic intervention. Its action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) The in situ gelation of the mucoadhesive thermogel provides a mechanical barrier against blood flow, and (2) the slow release of drugs from the thermogel at the hemorrhage site enables more rapid healing. Initial efforts will be dedicated to formulation development wherein compatibility of the thermogel with different drug candidates will be evaluated, and optimization of the gelation temperature will be performed. The best formulations will then be tested in vitro for stability, drug release kinetics, and mucoadhesion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach will be assessed in preclinical models of bleeding, demonstrating its superior ability to reach hemostasis. This is expected to apply to disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and oral mucositis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project supports the development of a medical device that enables minimally invasive graft-based reconstruction of the urethra as a long-lasting treatment for male urethral stricture, a class of conditions causing restrictions in flow. Approximately 1% of men on Medicare are treated for stricture annually, and an estimated 1 in 5 men will get a stricture in their lifetime. A urethral stricture progressively narrows the urethra - leading to urinary urgency, frequent and painful urination, and impaired intimacy. The current state of practice has many challenges:  Widely available endoscopic treatment is simple and minimally invasive but rarely curative, with high recurrence rates, and repeated endoscopic intervention worsens the stricture and turns a curable condition into a chronic disease, with devastating consequences to quality of life. Graft-based urethral reconstruction has excellent long-term outcomes but limited availability – as the complex open surgery is performed by a select group of reconstructive urologists. The proposed medical device simplifies minimally invasive graft-based urethral reconstruction to empower general urologists to deliver minimally invasive curative treatment.

    The proposed project focuses on demonstrating the anti-migration properties of a temporary indwelling urethral device prototype. The device is designed to deliver a graft to a urethral graft bed, and hold it in place as the graft adheres over a period of 14 days without migrating. Proof-of-concept studies of the mechanically functional prototype will be performed on the bench and in vivo, to be further advanced by integrating proprietary anti-migration features. Key milestones include the prototype's ability to meet: targeted biocompatibility/cytotoxicity benchmarks, anti-migration benchmarks using an in vitro model, and an absence of significant migration in vivo over a 14-day period.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve job-site safety of dry-stacking installation of masonry walls without binding mortar through the use of novel Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU). The AIMU multi-component wall system combines the advantages of wood and those of concrete and is potentially applicable for mid-rise multi-family housing, a key component of affordable housing stock in the US and worldwide.  These AIMUs can be laid quickly, safely, and accurately, reducing time and labor for cost-effective construction in the US and globally.  The proposed construction platform will improve durability and offer lower lifetime costs than standard wood-based wall construction.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will further develop a construction technology using masonry blocks via dry-stacking without binding mortar.  Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU) are made of cellular lightweight concrete (CLC) and an activated adhesion. The proposed work will conduct testing to confirm the AIMU's ability to fill incursions and block irregularities, evaluate interfacial shear resistance between the interlocking features, and evaluate the interfacial adhesion activated through pressure or moisture. These fundamental properties are critical to resolving the primary barriers for translation of dry-stack masonry construction technology. The project will also demonstrate rapid outdoor dry-stacking AIMU installation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable non-technical users to create complete and comprehensive software test automation. Additionally, it will enable growing software companies to ship their products faster with higher quality at a reasonable cost. Currently, these companies spend up to 50% of their resources on quality assurance (QA) and testing. This project will develop an automated process for testing software.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will combine symbolic reasoning algorithms, deep learning, and reinforcement learning models to automate software quality assurance testing. The two problems being addressed by this project are (1) software development teams spend up to 50% of their time testing software, and (2) they have to hire skilled software engineers to automate these tests. The objective of this research is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to make software quality assurance testing faster and enable non-technical workers to create sophisticated tests without the need to code. The proposed research aims to create an AI prototype by (i) building a baseline of manual test scenarios, (ii) building tests using symbolic reasoning (SR), (iii) incorporating deep learning, and (iv) adding reinforcement learning to generate tests.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the growth and processing parameters of a methane-reducing seaweed feed additive for ruminant livestock (i.e,. cattle). Globally, livestock methane emissions contribute up to 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%. The proposed project will advance this as a feed additive at scale by exploring three novel solutions for natural lighting optimization in land-based cultivation systems, profiling and integrating aquaculture wastewater (AWW) as a circular nutrient stream, and deploying an alternative processing method to the energy-intensive industry standard. These growth processes can likely be applied to algae production for other uses, such as food, while drying innovations are expected to be broadly applicable in tropical climates.

    The proposed SBIR Phase I project will build on work to grow Hawaiian Asparagopsis taxiformis in land-based systems and optimize for both yield and concentration of desired metabolites. Diurnal changes in solar position and irradiance, along with occlusion caused by algae self-shading, result in photosynthetic inefficiencies.  AWW contains large amounts of waste nitrogen and phosphorus; only 20-30% of nitrogen from the fish feed is retained in fish biomass. The integration of AWW will recover some of these nutrients and avoid downstream consequences of pollution, such as eutrophication. While drying material is important for the production of a shelf-stable product, existing technologies are either energy-intensive or perform poorly at retaining critical compounds in seaweed tissue. The project will test proposed solutions to this quandary, as well as contamination and strain development.

    The broader impact commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the accessibility of eye health care.  Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness but can be addressed with early detection, and the prevalence increases with age. However, existing tests can be tiring and difficult and require specialized equipment. This project will advance an inexpensive test for early detection for treatment.  This low-cost, tablet-based tool can offer universal, cost-effective glaucoma screening.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances novel retinal testing for glaucoma detection through improved modeling and data analysis of the visual system.  This project analyzes visual field test results to reveal a pair of linked cartographic maps that transmit central and peripheral retinal information to the brain through grouped retinal nerve fiber bundles segregated in a conformal mapping. A cone of photons displays the visual field information on the central S2 spherical non-Euclidean Riemann surface centered around the foveal axis, which lacks representation in the brain and can be considered as a singularity or reference region for each eye. Information on the S2 surface is transmitted through bundles of retinal nerve fibers that are grouped to represent single surfaces, and modeled as though the eye is a S3 4-dimensional hypersphere, with the blind spot being a singularity region and serving as the reference point. The retinal nerve fiber bundles transmitting the information to the brain are passively reordered at the blind spot and bring about an inversion of the Y (Up-Down) axis. Information from both eyes enables parallax removal and leads to depth perception. Information from the peripheral retinal regions of each eye is crossed across the optic chiasma and provides spatial locations of objects during peripheral vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide U.S. hospitals with a tool to help accurately predict the expected severity of illness for COVID-19 infected patients at the time of initial diagnosis. A simple interface uses Artificial Intelligence-based predictive algorithms to help hospitals make informed and accurate decisions about which patients require specific care and treatment interventions. This enhanced process allows hospitals better and faster decision-making on patient care and treatments, redirecting hospital resources (including staff, hospital beds, ICU) for maximum effectiveness. In the longer term, the platform can be adapted to predict illnesses related to other infectious diseases, and also scaled for countries where availability of hospital infrastructure is limited.

    This Small Business Technology (STTR) Phase I project will develop a completely new category of medical diagnostic and prognostic tools via a novel approach that relies on analysis of a complex multi-variate signal, reflective of the patient’s entire salivary metabolome and proteome. Artificial intelligence tools will be used to see if signal clusters correlating with patient outcomes can be identified. This is a radical departure from traditional medical diagnostics which evaluate individual biomarkers for a clinical diagnosis. Such approaches are ill suited to the task of predicting future patient outcomes. The scope of this pilot phase work is the development of an effective algorithm and understanding algorithm efficacy and reliability in prediction and classification of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The goals of the pilot project are to: (i) obtain COVID-19 patient bio-fluid samples, and (ii) develop machine learning techniques for an effective predictive algorithm. Multiple machine learning techniques and comparison strategies will be used for algorithm development and efficacy testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a new probe to detect low levels of viral load, such as that causing COVID-19.  Rapid and reliable kits are not currently readily available. This project will provide rapid detection of viral material using exsiting cost-effective techniques with fewer detection errors. Being able to quantify and track viral loads at low concentration and high accuracy will expedite tests, reduce false negatives, and accelerate vaccine and drug development to combat COVID-19, and future pandemics.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop innovative fluorescent probes based on high-brightness fluorophores/dyes (HBFs) that offer tunable extinction coefficients up to several thousand times higher than commercial dyes. Based on this HBF platform technology, we will be able to create high-brightness qPCR probes that can specifically quantify viral RNAs by strong and tunable fluorescent signals at fewer amplification cycles and minimum replication errors. The activity, efficiency, and specificity of high-brightness qPCR probes will be evaluated in the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to digitize access to high-quality custom prosthetic and orthotic devices. This will increase convenience and reduce the cost of care for millions of people with limb loss or other disabilities. In 2018, the leading cause of amputations was complications from diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases, and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older. Despite progress in other aspects of prosthetic limb design, inefficiencies in the design and manufacture of the custom prosthetic socket still exist. The proposed technology uses a computational approach to digitize the biomechanical design required to develop high-quality, custom prosthetic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to digitize and automate customization of wearable devices that conform to the portion of a person’s limb remaining after an amputation. The function of this device (i.e. prosthetic socket) is to re-distribute pressure to areas of the person’s soft tissues that tolerate those pressures. This project will introduce new guidelines and processes for prosthetic socket design. The objectives include: (1) codify, modify, and implement existing design guidelines within a biomechanics engine to manage customizations for the individual user; and (2) implement a machine learning framework using training datasets of paired limbs and prosthetic sockets. The techniques developed by this work can be extended to other biomechanical processes with load/pressure transfer considerations beyond prosthetics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a system to improve pharmaceutical manufacturing and sepsis treatment. A toxic substance known as endotoxin is a common contaminant in many types of therapeutics, and it is the primary cause of batch rejection in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The economic impact of pharmaceutical batch failure due to contamination is high due to loss of product and facility closure for cleaning. The endotoxin removal market within drug manufacturing was valued at $315 million in 2018 and is expected to grow due to the increase in biopharmaceutical products. Additionally, endotoxins are dangerous when they enter patients’ bloodstream and can cause various medical complications, including sepsis.  The technology has the potential to remove endotoxins from patients’ bloodstream more effectively than current solutions  This project will develop a universal high-efficiency endotoxin removal filter that has the potential to not only improve drug manufacturing but also provide a life-saving treatment for sepsis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a high-affinity, high-specificity filter for endotoxin removal by using a protein that specifically binds endotoxin and has been shown to remove 99.9% of endotoxin from protein preparations. Traditionally, the use of proteins for product separations cause problems with durability and protein density, stability, and activity. These problems are overcome with unique materials that allow 100% incorporation of active proteins via a stable fusion with substantially increased protein stability. The binding capacity of the materials for endotoxin similar to current solutions (5,000,000 EU/mL) would be considered successful, although the binding capacity is expected to greatly exceed the current standard. Current solutions are compatible with only specific types of therapeutics. A prototype filter will be evaluated for endotoxin separation and protein recovery for three protein therapeutics. An 80% recovery of each therapeutic is expected, with simultaneous removal of 5,000,000 EU/mL of endotoxin. These tests will prove the technical feasibility of the prototype filter by showing the materials have a significantly higher binding capacity for endotoxin than current methods and that they are compatible with multiple types of therapeutics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance an improved system to sense and map  atmospheric conditions using nano-drones that are the size of small birds; these systems have benefited from recent innovations in miniature power electronics and flight control sensors.  The proposed project leverages the safety, cost and portability advantages of these small form factor aircraft in a system of coordinated drones flying in formation to measure wind, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations. Each flight of the swarm can cover hundreds of square miles, creating a high resolution 3D map of atmospheric properties. This enables the study of wind currents and gas movement for applications including detection of urban gas leaks, smog movement, and forest fire detection. Satellite measurements can be validated and improved through aerial measurements. This research will benefit public health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance new software to analyze and optimize nano-drones. This project will expand the understanding of miniaturized (under 100 g) drone performance and enable the development of advanced nano-drones to carry out valuable sensing missions. This project will: (1) validate an optimization framework with laboratory test data; (2) develop a novel, portable drone docking station allowing for easy launching, landing and charging of hundreds or thousands of drones by a single operator, eventually enabling fully automated use for continuous monitoring applications; and (3) develop visualization and analysis tools to facilitate data analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the state-of-the art of an emerging class of vision-based, autonomous navigation technologies to open new possibilities for low-cost/high-performance personal assistive robots. The robotics solution enables mobility-impaired individuals to have more agency over their environment and enjoy a higher quality-of-life. This helps address the severe shortage of caregivers for the elderly and post-acute care patients by empowering individuals to maintain their independence, extending the impact of caregivers, and reducing the cost of care in both home and facility settings.  Additionally, by providing affordable and reliable isolation support in COVID-19 care settings, the proposed solution can help decrease the financial burden and increase the public health outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease management. The core robotics solution has an immediate addressable market of 11 million high-needs users in the U.S. alone, with projected revenues of roughly $1.65 Billion five years after product launch. Further commercialization opportunities come from licensing parts of the developed navigation technology for other robotics applications and developing an ecosystem of complementary products around the core robotics solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enable a new generation of assistive service robots that are comparable to commercial robots in performance, but significantly more affordable for individual use and personal care applications. The innovation adopts emerging visual positioning technologies from Augmented Reality to enable robust navigation for mobile robots using low-cost, consumer-grade electronics, while addressing a key limitation of visual positioning systems namely, that external lighting conditions and other changes in an environment can dramatically impact their performance. The innovation addresses these challenges via a combination of hardware and software that learns and stabilizes the highest value visual elements of the environment to maintain persistency across lighting conditions and long periods of time — a development critical to making assistive robots cost-effective for adoption at a large scale. Research objectives include: fully developing and integrating the visual persistency system, to achieve accurate and replicable robot navigation performance across a representative range of lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the target operating environments and benchmarking the resulting solution against state-of-the art technologies, to demonstrate its superior performance (i.e., it can successfully localize in at least 90% of cases where other solutions fail).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate feasibility of machine-learning (ML)-guided experimental campaigns that predict, assess, and optimize electroorganic transformations with small experimental datasets. Companies across the chemical industry have pinpointed electrochemistry as a promising avenue for the implementation of more sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. However, the large cost and effort required in new process development hinders the implementation of electrochemical technologies. ML predictive algorithms can be a powerful tool to accelerate the development and optimization of more sustainable chemical processes, but repeatedly require large amounts of experimental data to train the models. These large datasets are often unavailable and expensive to obtain, which significantly limits the use of ML in the chemical industry. The project will advance future manufacturing by enabling the development of new and more sustainable chemical production routes using 50% less experiments, ultimately unlocking the manufacture of new molecules, medicines, and materials in societal applications. Moreover, by reducing the number of experiments required, the technology will significantly lower emissions and resource consumption in the industry.

    The proposed project introduces a ML platform capable of guiding experimental campaigns and data collection to enable accurate predictions of reaction behavior with the smallest possible datasets. The approach relies on the combination of chemical engineering and ML knowledge to overcome the optimization limitations found within each field. It will be validated using the electrooxidation of p-methoxytoluene as a model reaction and will elucidate the fundamental limitations and strengths of ML predictive models capturing the complexity of physical systems with small datasets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are significant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health.  Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths.  Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment.  The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs. The culture-free analyzer will complete the diagnosis in 120 minutes. The analyzer will allow clinicians to limit the use of BSAs and start using narrow spectrum antibiotics in the early stage of treatment to enhance efficacy and reduce the prevalence of MDROs. The goals of the project are: (1) To construct a prototype analyzer, which will provide simultaneous diagnosis on multiple samples in 120 minutes, and (2) To conduct a small-scale characterization of the clinical performance of the prototype with clinical samples to establish its credibility as a clinical diagnostic technology. The prototype analyzer will consist of a multi-channel signal acquisition electronics console and detection plates.  The detection plate will contain an array of bacteria-specific detection electrodes and will be inserted into the console and operated by the console for measurements. The analyzer will detect MRSA in clinical samples and distinguish MRSA from S. aureus.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate development of a digital infrastructure trust layer for public health data around monitoring and responding to COVID-19 public health objectives. This project will provide both trust and accessibility through the application of blockchain technology to public health data to transform it into verified, legally weighted, and tamper resistant data upon which decision makers in the public and private sector can benefit. This innovative combination of new technological solutions will allow for better products, data analytics, predictive modelling systems, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) responsiveness based on organized and trusted systems. Since public health statistics are used by private enterprise as well as the public sector and the general public, the addition of a trust layer to public health data more widely is important as fidelity in statistics is critical to effective individual and organizational action.

    This project’s goal is to develop tools and practices to make authoritative, reliable data available, enabled by cryptographic techniques and accessible to a broader set of individuals and organizations. The scope of the project looks to develop aggregation, access, and reporting systems which can support new decentralized economics, such as smart contract marketplaces, while remaining interoperable and accessible to users of legacy technology. The solution requires creation of a single, trustworthy platform that combines research, development and commercial application of emerging blockchain approaches with a suite of supporting technologies and systems including: distributed data infrastructure, flexible delivery methods, intuitive interfaces, and analytics tools. This research hopes to allow for the creation of novel resources to support the trustworthiness and consequently, the fundamental usefulness of all public health data records. The expected outcomes include: improved data integrity using blockchain-backed systems, tools enabling accelerated innovation in data driven decision making, and a prototype marketplace for COVID-19 resources managed by blockchain.

    \ Phase I project is to establish a proof-of-concept for an oncological medical\
    \ device that will be used as an adjunct treatment for pancreatic cancer (PC).\
    \ PC is one of the lethal forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related\
    \ death in the US. Chemotherapy is the first-line standard treatment for cancer\
    \ therapy. The medications used during chemotherapy are administered through an\
    \ intravenous infusion (IV), pill, or injection. Once these medications enter\
    \ the bloodstream, they destroy the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. The\
    \ most common side effects for patients are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and decreased\
    \ immunity leading to a low quality of life. Our prototype aims to reduce chemotherapy\
    \ side effects and the need for in-hospital chemotherapy administration, significantly\
    \ reducing healthcare costs. The proposed innovative technology offers an alternative\
    \ to direct surgical resection in the sensitive areas surrounding the pancreas.\
    \ This treatment will extend the number of patients who can benefit from surgery\

    \ One of the significant challenges associated with PC treatment is the standard\
    \ administration techniques (e.g., intravenous injection, oral administration)\
    \ cannot efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of the drug to the tumor\
    \ site because of the pancreas' anatomy. The innovative technology used in this\
    \ prototype device will render it as an implantable, biodegradable, drug-eluting\
    \ product allowing for spatio-temporal control and delivery of various active\
    \ pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly to the tumor site. Further, reductions\
    \ in global toxicity and access to traditionally unresectable areas may enable\
    \ higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents than could be tolerated by\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project improves outcomes following orthopedic ligament and tendon reconstruction. More than 1 million surgeries to repair torn ligaments and tendons are performed in the United States annually. However, the failure rates are reported to be as high as 25% and the majority of failures are attributed to a technical error, which costs the US healthcare system $2.5 billion each year. Stitching has been identified as a critical, technically complex step in the surgery that, if improved, can be a way to reduce the incidence of failure. Current stitching needles have serious limitations that make stitching slow, tedious, and inaccurate. The two-part needle technology proposed in this project fundamentally changes how stitching can be performed. Better quality and faster stitching provides a societal benefit of improved patient outcomes as well as commercial benefits of avoided costs associated with failed surgeries and savings from reduced procedure times.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports development of a revolutionary suturing device that will advance stitching capabilities for orthopedic ligament and tendon repair surgery. The groundbreaking two-part needle design offers a value proposition of improved speed and quality of stitching, two essential elements for clinical success. This project has two overarching technical objectives: First, prototypes will be constructed with variable characteristics, and force testing will be performed to determine how each characteristic impacts functionality of the device. Performance of the device with regards to forces experienced during stitching will be compared to conventional needles. Second, prototypes will be constructed and tested by potential customers to assess usability for the intended purpose of creating specific stitch patterns. Speed of stitching and biomechanical strength of the stitch patterns will be compared to patterns created with conventional needles to quantify the value proposition. Successful completion of the objectives will substantially advance the two-part needle technology toward commercialization in orthopedics and provide a basis for additional research of the two-part needle design for other surgical applications that rely on stitching.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an engineered probiotic as an treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. Acute gout episodes cause debilitating pain and hypersensitivity, seriously impairing mobility. Over time, joint damage and deformity, chronic usage-related pain, and disfigurement follow. Although gout can be treated by drugs that lower uric acid levels, these drugs have significant drawbacks for many patients: they have limited effectiveness, are associated with serious side effects, and may be expensive. Gout patients experience an estimated increase of 5 absence days annually with an incremental cost of $3,000 per patient. The 9.2 million gout patients in the USA spend more than $1.3 billion per year on gout drugs. Moreover, roughly half take additional supplements. The proposed project will develop a novel probiotic strain to address hyperuricemia.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance hyperuricemia treatment using an engineered probiotic. The proposed treatment is based on the observation that enzymatically degrading uric acid in the intestine reduces serum uric acid levels, unlike conventional treatments targeting the circulatory system, the urinary tract, or function systemically. This project will use genetic screening to identify a probiotic strain to break down uric acid, engineering it to prevent gene mobility across species and avoid transfer of antibiotic resistance to the intestinal microbiome. Finally, we will confirm safety and efficacy in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to proactively manage eye health. Approximately 285 million people and 39 million people suffer respectively from visual impairment and blindness. Monitoring of eye disease in early stages is critical to slowing its progression, but currently this assessment requires specialized equipment in ophthalmology practices or optometry offices.  Smartphone-based disease detection is customizable, portable, easy-to-access, and multi-functional.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to design and develop an eye disease diagnostic tool using a smartphone.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide waste concrete as a new raw material source for the glass and other industries.  It is estimated that 2.2 billion tons of waste concrete is generated globally each year.  About 70% of the construction waste generated in the US is concrete, but it is not typically used as a raw material for glass production or other chemical processes.  Using concrete as a raw material reduces its contribution to landfills as well as the need for mining virgin raw materials., and contributes environmental benefits.  This STTR Phase I project will study processes to prepare furnace-ready concrete for glass production.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the feasibility of waste concrete as a raw material constituent (feedstock) for calcium-silicate glass and glass-making.  Environmental benefits are possible because concrete contains the same key oxides used in glass making (silicon, calcium, aluminum and iron oxides) as well as sulfur compounds (e.g. gypsum mixed with the cement to regulate setting, and therefore can potentially serve as a candidate raw material in the production of calcium-silicate soda lime and calcium-borosilicate glasses.Research objectives include: 1) characterize variations in chemical composition from industrially relevant sources; 2) determine variation in contaminant concentrations; 3) demonstrate processes and methods to address contaminant variations' 4) characterize the specifications for a furnace-ready waste concrete glass batch; 5) produce pilot batches of calcium-silicate soda lime glass; and 6) characterize variations in produced glasses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to combat online trade in counterfeit and illicit goods. The project will integrate the results of a decade of academic research on anonymous online ("dark net") marketplaces and modeling of counterfeit pharmaceutical online sales with novel monitoring solutions for traditional e-commerce marketplaces. It will allow for the development and validation through pilot customer tests of an integrated platform for automated continuous data collection and analysis of the major players in the counterfeit and illicit goods online business. Through automation, the proposed technology should considerably reduce costs to brand protection managers (and law enforcement), allowing them to use their limited resources more effectively. This work should also help address some pressing economic and public health issues linked to the proliferation of counterfeits, such as counterfeit drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate automation of many manual online counterfeiting monitoring activities. The project will also show that intuitive visual interfaces can help customers (law enforcement agencies, brand protection managers) have immediate access to higher-level objects more useful for investigative purposes. These higher-level objects include metrics on the amount of sales conducted by a specific entity, deduplication between vendors, or inventory clustering. To do so, the project will further develop automated classification and analysis using techniques that were prototyped in the research lab, scale these techniques up to a production environment to further minimize human intervention, and combine these techniques with novel algorithms developed for slightly different application cases (traditional e-commerce marketplaces).
