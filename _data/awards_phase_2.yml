    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II is to improve the mobility of wheelchair users.  There are more than 2.5 M wheelchair users in the US. This project will develop an electronic aftermarket add-on accessory to increase manual wheelchair users’ height up to 18 inches or more in 5 seconds. The new wheelchair lift (WL) will increase their Quality of Life and their ability to independently perform activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, dressing) and instrumental activities of daily living (transportation, shopping, cooking, doing laundry, and housework). The solution will replace expensive home retrofitting ($20 K) and will reduce the need for help in outside settings, such as reaching for items on shelves, empowering the users. The WL will bridge the gap between the disabled and the able-bodied population, providing a means to increase wheelchair users’ participation in the labor force (currently only 20%) and enabling more employment options. Similarly, the WL will offer employers an effective way to support workers with disabilities and reduce costs to adapt the work environment to provide reasonable accommodations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to generate a final functional prototype of the wheelchair lift (WL) ready for usability tests with end-users. The Phase II project extends prior work on a prototype satisfying the major design specifications of weight, lift maximum load, and time of ascension, de-risking the most significant technological challenges associated with the project. The proposed activities will enable systems engineering of hardware and electronics development and the next generation prototype for testing and regulatory clearance. The prototype will be produced under Quality Management Systems and an industrial manufacturing process will be established.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is in the reduction of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by proactively responding to data from novel sensors.  In addition, the technology being developed in this project can also help measure airborne particle concentrations in other environments.  The successful completion of this proposal will result in improved public health from reduced hospital stay and commercially benefit both hospitals and patients by reducing hospitalization costs.  The development and deployment of sensors in a hospital, enabled by this project, will help our startup build a critical dataset to train analytical models for near real-time identification of hospital spaces with a pathogen problem.

    This STTR Phase 2 project proposes to develop a novel sensor for integrated measurement of air quality (AQ) and pathogen loads in the air and combine these measurements to create a an early warning system to identify contaminated areas in critical facilities like hospitals.  Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are $20 billion problem and are responsible for over 100,000 deaths in the US.  Our low-cost, robust, networkable, and easy-to-operate sensors will provide a data driven solution to the critical public health problem.  Combining novel techniques for real-time detection of airborne particles with state-of-the-art pathogen analysis, our sensor system will provide data to develop analytical models that will predict hospital spaces with pathogen problems before they cause expensive infections.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve vertical farms. The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density.

    This SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement.  Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.

    This proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to allow America’s grape industry to reduce crop losses due to spring frost, estimated at over $1 billion per year, as well as related job losses – more than 11,000 individuals in the State of Washington alone.  The encapsulating bud break delay technology and predictive analytics support farmers with decision making tools ahead of impending frost events during bud break season.  Such tools may enable rural communities to achieve economic stability by decreasing yield losses and lowering production costs.  The technology fills gaps in knowledge needed to make informed decisions on individual farms, resulting in better management decisions in the face of increasing complexities of spring freeze threats. Additionally, use of the encapsulation technology may reduce carbon emissions and water usage from current fossil fuel-intensive conventional frost mitigation measures such as burners, wind machines and sprinklers.

    The proposed encapsulating bud break delay technology involves two main advances. First, a gel encapsulation spray biologically delays the process of bud break consistently up to 14 days and increases cold resistance up to 6 degrees Celsius. Second, to guide growers in delivering this product, a Decision Support System (DSS) aids grape growers in deciding when it is necessary to mitigate pending frost conditions. The Phase II project focuses on increasing the predictive accuracy of the DSS and scaling the system. Specifically, the team will focus on: a) optimizing the formulation and testing in the lab, b) field-testing and data collection at five sites, c) enhancing DSS capabilities with additional data and analysis, d) scaling up for large-scale manufacture and application, and e) gathering data for regulatory approvals. This gel encapsulation solution for frost protection of vineyards may find future applications in other fruits crops such as apples and stones fruits that are even more susceptible to spring frost damage than grapes.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project continues from Phase I to realize a new surgical tool system to enable safe and precise delivery of stem cells and genes for ophthalmic application, specifically to repair and restore vision for patients with retinal degeneration. Visual impairment occurs in the natural course of aging, with some conditions potentially addressed surgically.  Associated improvements in both quality of life and reduced health care expenditures can be addressed with a system involving augmented real-time visualization technology, tools capable of minute actions, and smart algorithms informing surgical actions.  The proposed technology improves imaging by incorporating machine vision, with applications in ophthalmic treatment and beyond.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided sub-retinal injector system.  Technical tasks include conducting studies to test clinical safety and procedure efficacy on both cadaveric human eyes and in-vivo porcine eyes.  Specifically, trained surgeons will use the system to validate the capability to execute tasks related to subretinal microinjection procedures, determine the time to task completion, and characterize the magnitude and frequency of errors.  The system will be validated with histology samples and compared to current the standard of care of freehand performance.  Optimization and validation studies will take place to advance the translation of this technology.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to address two common conditions in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single device. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision and the leading cause of blindness in the world, is expected to affect an estimated 30 million Americans by 2020.  Currently no single product restores both visual clarity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract surgery.  The proposed device will change the standard of care for cataract surgery, leading to improved outcomes.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an intraocular lens using a new, highly sensitive optical system that leverages large differences in refractive indices and has a novel mechanism of action, potentially leading to levels of accommodation on par with the abilities of a young, pre-presbyopic individual. Prospective technologies may fail to exhibit adequate accommodative amplitude to restore a full range of vision, produce unwanted visual artifacts, or are too complex for adoption at scale. Using highly sensitive optics, the proposed device mimics the shape of the natural lens while still maintaining relative simplicity, allowing for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye to produce significant accommodation and permitting the use of standard cataract surgical procedures.  This technical tasks associated with the new intraocular lens include: (1) assuring visual quality through the device’s accommodative range, (2) optimizing mechanics for restoration of a complete range of vision, (3) integrating seamlessly with existing surgical procedures, and (4) testing implant longevity and safety.  Validating the objectives above through optical and mechanical testing in benchtop, cadaver, and animal models will provide a strong foundation for clinical investigations and translation.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help more amputees walk safely with less effort. Approximately 800,000 individuals live with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. The 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee have two options:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The first option requires that the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter does so automatically but cost $30,000-100,000 and requires physical qualification, limiting the availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with any leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. This project will explore the trade space of mechanical and analytical capabilities.  This project will validate intuitive movement and universal stability for above-knee amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work will advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be in lowering the overall cost of lithium-ion batteries. Material cost reduction drives greater adoption of technologies using batteries such as electric vehicles and storage systems while increasing the use of renewables.  Cathode material is a battery's largest cost contributor, and with the market growing 10+% year-over-year, producers are having to spend millions of dollars in plant expansions to meet this increased demand. Technology solutions that allow cathode material producers to cost effectively expand current production capacity without investment or sacrificing quality or performance are immediately needed in this industry.  Current industry processes require lengthy high-temperature production steps that consume large amounts of energy throughout the production process.  This phase II project is focused on developing a "one-pot" manufacturing process that will address the current market priorities of lowering production costs, shortening manufacturing times, increasing production yield and using sustainable materials, allowing cathode producers to significantly increase profit margins while addressing demand for increased production.  More broadly, lower battery costs will increase the adoption of technologies that utilize lithium-ion batteries and enable greater implementation of other renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to develop a breakthrough, sustainable, "one-pot" process for the manufacture of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.  This manufacturing process will capitalize on the opportunity within the cathode production to address its needs for lowering production costs, increasing production capacity, and reducing energy consumption.  The Phase II project will involve (i) the optimization of the manufacturing process, as measured by half-cell battery performance screening, (ii) demonstrate doubling throughput and providing cost savings of at least 20% over current production processes for NMC 622, (iii) demonstrate battery performance that is equivalent to, or better than, that of a commercial benchmark in full cell testing, and (iv) design and construction of a pilot reactor.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals as well as enable large scale field monitoring and management in production agriculture.  The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to establish autonomous data collection under-canopy from field crops using a low-cost ground robot. The proposed work will enhance the ability to collect data autonomously in full-scale crop-breeding fields throughout the season and enable on-site data analytics for remote sites with limited connectivity. Long-term field adaptive autonomy will be achieved through implementation of multiple low-cost sensors. Robot's real-time control algorithms will be developed to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under-canopy field environments. Finally, the research will develop hardware specific edge-compute versions of the analytics algorithms to enable on-site data analysis. These innovations will together enable global deployment of the system for effective data collection and phenotyping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the ability to enable a safer, more reliable, and more resilient electric power system. A reliable and efficient grid is the cornerstone of the nation’s economy. With the rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), a transition from conventional generation plants to utility-scale wind and solar farms, and the threat of cyber- and/or physical attacks on the bulk electric system, ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid has become ever more challenging. The software being developed in this project will help grid planning engineers and operators cope with these modern challenges. For the first time, engineers from organizations across the utility industry will be able to collaboratively plan the grid on a secure, scalable, cloud-based software platform that provides the capabilities needed to fully assess the impact of renewables and DERs. The software’s industry-leading simulation robustness will allow users to analyze extreme contingencies, cascading events, and weak grid scenarios to develop preventive and corrective actions that secure the grid. The software is designed to support an annual $50B+ in US power infrastructure investment and an annual $400B+ in power market transactions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software for electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) planning.  Technical tasks are to: 1) Make cloud architecture responsive to demand with autoscaling and queueing services; 2) Architect results generation for minimized data storage requirements; 3) Manage data handling for reduced re-loading of datasets; 4) Implement a file parser for industry-standard three-phase unbalanced distribution system models; 5) Implement models of common distribution system components; and 6) Extend the cloud platform to support integrated T&D analysis.  Integration of these optimized components will lead to an improved system engineered for usage at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make on-site hydrogen generation convenient and economically viable. Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure.  One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer.  The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype.  The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity.  The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable greater electric vehicle use; furthermore, the technology’s potential to double battery life will reduce the environmental impact of disposed batteries. This project accelerates electric car adoption by enabling use of 100% of battery operating ranges and maximize usable energy capacity, increasing ongoing driving ranges by 50-100x. This project is a key enabler for expected growth in the global lithium-ion battery market (expected to grow to $68 B by 2022) and the annual hybrid and electric car market (forecast to exceed 10 million vehicles annually by 2025).

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to optimize the technology for battery fast charge and capacity retention targets. Battery performance advancements are most often limited by chemistry and materials improvements to electrodes, electrolytes, or cell structure limiting the trade space (i.e., requiring power vs. energy tradeoffs).  The proposed charging technology and associated software will selectively optimize cell design for various performance metrics by controlling electrode surface phenomena, such as lithium plating and dendrite formation, that otherwise cause permanent capacity loss during normal use and accelerate internal physical processes limiting charge rate. Technical tasks include: 1) Demonstration of performance improvements to commercial Li-Ion and fabricated Li-metal battery cells; 2) Adaptation of the process from small cells and modules to electric vehicle battery packs; 3) Development of refined sensing and feedback-based control algorithms using Predictive Learning (PL) and Machine Learning (ML) systems; 4) Verification and validation for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and System on a Chip (SoC) formats.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on advancing the domestic manufacturing capabilities for high-value nanomaterials for new membrane materials. Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

    Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a simple wearable device to manage pain. Despite advances in new therapies, addictive narcotic medications still remain a widely utilized method to control pain for many conditions. The proposed technology represents a new noninvasive approach to blocking nerve conduction without reliance on drugs. The device can be easily adapted to treat any condition wherein pain is transmitted along nerves close to the skin surface. This work will demonstrate feasibility of a novel therapeutic approach to pain management without risk of drug dependence or addiction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fully develop a human wearable thermal nerve block device for treating severe head and neck pain by blocking nerves in the occipital region. Occipital pain is driven by a number of physiological and pathological causes, and many patients fail to find adequate pain relief solutions that allow them to continue their daily activities, thus leading to poor quality of life with reduced productivity and socialization. The device developed in this project will thermally modulate the occipital region in such a way as to initiate and then maintain a drug-free nerve block.

    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is reducing wildfire-related damage\
    \ in the US, reducing the risk of injury for firefighters, and improving water\
    \ conservation. Wildfires are becoming major environmental threats in the US.\
    \ In 2020, over 4 million acres of land were burned in the Western US, displacing\
    \ tens of thousands of people and forcing millions to breathe unhealthy air. A\
    \ recent study estimated that 50% of all tiny particles that are two and one half\
    \ microns or less in width (PM2.5 particles) in the Western US could be attributed\
    \ to wildfires. With warmer and drier seasons, in places like California, wildfires\
    \ are becoming a year-round risk. Better fire suppression technologies are highly\
    \ desired to counter this increasing environmental threat. Fire hose nozzles are\
    \ the key instrument used by firefighters in the US; However, research improving\
    \ these nozzles is lacking. The nozzles used by firefighters are centuries old\
    \ designs that were not optimized for fire-suppression. The proposed Phase II\
    \ project aims to optimize the nozzles to enable up to two times faster suppression.\
    \ Faster suppression can prevent billions in dollars of property damage each year\
    \ and save lives. The proposed technology has the potential to generate up to\
    \ $50 million in revenue and 40 jobs by 2026.  This SBIR Phase II Project will\
    \ use the fundamentals of thermal management and computational fluid dynamic simulations\
    \ to design fire-hose nozzles that can increase fire-suppression efficiency by\
    \ two times while saving 50% of the water. For rapid design iteration, 3D printing\
    \ techniques will be used to create nozzle prototypes for field testing and conduct\
    \ the design of experiment studies. Traditional fire-fighting nozzles are classified\
    \ as smooth-bore nozzles or combination nozzles. Smooth-bore nozzles create solid\
    \ streams with low coverage. Combination nozzles can generate wide stream patterns\
    \ but have a significantly smaller ranges in wide mode. By optimizing the flow\
    \ pathways, a diverging solid stream pattern will be created. The diverging solid\
    \ stream will combine the long-range and penetration of smooth-bore nozzles and\
    \ wide coverage of combination nozzles in one system. In the Phase I work, fire-suppression\
    \ studies showed that such water stream patterns increase suppression rates by\
    \ three times for vegetation fires while using less than half the water. In the\
    \ proposed Phase II work, the nozzles will be optimized for structural fires.\
    \ Additionally, as part of the Phase II work, an adjustable smooth-bore nozzle\
    \ will be developed. These adjustable nozzles will further increase the suppression\
    \ efficiency and allow the firefighters to adapt to different fire scenarios.\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the improvement of high-power devices that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs) and their charging stations. The development of the proposed high-power devices will potentially reduce EV charging time to less than 10 minutes by increasing the charging module's power from 300 kW to over 1 MW.  Furthermore, this technology can potentially increase the range of electric vehicles significantly by increasing efficiency, and miniaturizing power modules by eliminating cooling systems.  These systems are based on diamonds, which have special properties when used in advanced devices, and will be easily extended to applications requiring high-temperature operation (above 300 C) and high-power switching capabilities, such as geothermal drilling, aerospace, and power grids, as well as application in extreme environments and space exploration.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fabricate next generation semiconductor high-power diodes (1200 V blocking and 10 A forward current at less than 10 V) that are reliable at high temperatures (300 C) and overcome many of the challenges with existing technologies. Diamond has a higher breakdown field than other existing semiconductor (wide bandgap) materials; thus, diamond devices offer the potential of higher blocking voltage. Technical objectives of this project include optimizing the workflow of material deposition, device design and device fabrication processes to achieve 1200 V blocking voltage by developing device designs that increase breakdown field by 2-4 times to enable broad translation of this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of low-cost, flexible displays allowing smart objects to better communicate with their users. Researchers estimate that in 2017 there were 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that were not computers, estimated to grow to 125 billion by 2025. These Internet of Things devices are already used in many applications for transportation, health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. These devices can enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety; they will require displays that are thin, low power, flexible or curved, and easy to read. A near-term need is autonomous transportation, which will need a method of visual communication between vehicle and rider.  This project will develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays; just this initial transportation application will help improve mobility for the elderly and disabled, traffic safety, and related needs.  In the longer term, this project will enable manufacturing of improved displays with reduced processing waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix (OLED) displays. These displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography, a slow and expensive process. The high-resolution printable anode developed here replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process, laying the foundation for fully roll-to-roll printed displays.

    \ and in particular habit reversal training, has shown efficacy, this method is\
    \ traditionally burdened by unreliable journaling, a lack of access to treatment,\
    \ and difficulty for patients to perform in real-time because of a lack of awareness.\
    \ While real-time awareness devices do exist, there is room for improvement in\
    \ detection accuracy. This project will integrate a novel sensor system into a\
    \ wearable device that can lead to state-of-the-art detection accuracy of BFRB-related\
    \ behaviors.  This wearable sensor solution is the first of its kind, using the\
    \ novel sensor to extract meaningful biomechanical information. \n\nThis Small\
    \ Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in new behavior\
    \ recognition algorithms, a new remote monitoring system, and new data generated\

    \ system and characterize signal artifacts that may influence detection accuracy;\
    \ 2) develop new behavior detection algorithms using data captured in the lab;\
    \ 3) conduct self-guided experiments in the field using the remote monitoring\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new technology for blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people to use touchscreen devices and explore quantitative data. Currently there are no commercial solutions for the 285 million BVI individuals and their support networks to access text and graphical materials.  The proposed project will advance software that converts graphical and text information into a form for BVI users to explore and utilize. This will enable greater education and work opportunities as well as greater independence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II effort continues development of a novel touchscreen-based information access software offering multisensory representations of both text and graphical information in digital media. Information can be efficiently conveyed with graphical tools such as bar graphs, but BVI users cannot exploit these methods to synthesize data.  This project develops the artificial intelligence (AI) framework to support automatic conversion of visual graphics into multisensory graphics and demonstrates its utility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of renewable electricity.  Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by 2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account for as much as 85% of total costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at scale.

    The  broader  impact/commercial  potential  of  this  Small  Business  Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the support of newborn and infant health services at the point-of-care (i.e., in pediatrician offices and at home). This project will develop quantitative imagining and machine learning technology that will allow pediatricians to evaluate and monitor the infant’s head development during well-child visits and/or remotely. If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized  clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone. These parameters are commonly used to monitor child development, and in the diagnosis and treatment planning of common conditions with head deformations. In this  project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies. This approach can handle object motion and can be implemented directly on a smartphone/tablet to compute full three-dimensional shape analysis.

    This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the productivity, environmental sustainability, and profitability of soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is a major driver of rainforest deforestation, motivating improved yields for environmental sustainability.  In addition, current commercial soybean varieties are highly susceptible to Asian soybean rust, an aggressive fungal disease that is especially severe in tropical and subtropical climates and can decimate soybean yield. This disease is controlled by chemical fungicides that are expensive, pose risks to the environment and human health, and are becoming less effective as the pathogen develops tolerance to over-used chemicals. This project will enable the development of soybean varieties immune to this disease. This will reduce the need for fungicide use in soybean cultivation, reduce yield loss caused by the pathogen, and improve grower profitability. In addition, this technology can be expanded to other crops.

    The proposed project will result in the identification of new plant disease resistance traits with activity against the pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust. The typical plant species has hundreds of immune receptor genes which surveil for the presence of invading pathogens. Plant breeders routinely use plant immune receptor genes to develop new disease-resistant crop varieties. However, traditional methods to identify and translate these traits are time-consuming. The proposed work utilizes a rapid gene discovery platform to accelerate identification of new disease resistance traits. This project will identify and test several resistance traits. The identification and cloning of these resistance gene sequences will allow them to be quickly moved into elite soybean varieties, resulting in significant time and labor savings relative to traditional breeding. These traits can be stacked together to confer durable resistance against a broad range of Asian soybean rust strains.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project focuses on improving the management of chronic disease by enabling team-based primary care is key to achieving clinical results and taking advantage of new “value based" payment reforms. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, six out of ten adults have a chronic disease and 90% of the national annual healthcare expenditures are spend on people with these conditions.  Our technology proposes to apply precision-education instructional theory to enhance primary care team competencies and promote situational awareness, enhanced communication, defined role clarity, improved coordination and leadership support to improve patient outcomes which is directly aligned to the National Science Foundation’s mission of promoting science to advance the nation’s health.  This project is being designed for commercial use in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which serve one in twelve people in the United States.  There are 1,373 FQHCs in the US serving 27 million patients annually in medically underserved areas. Public and private payment models are rapidly moving toward incentives/bonuses for team-based care and demonstrated outcome improvements. Improvements in the cost and outcomes of care for this patients with chronic disease will have enormous social and economic benefit for the Nation.

    This SBIR Phase II project uses machine learning to integrate individual-level clinical and social characteristics into suggested treatment paths and to apply precision training techniques that improve the skills of individual members of the care team. Our objectives focus on validating the feasibility of machine learning to provide health professionals with recommended workflows and continued education based on trends and gaps in care identified from patient data. The method includes a computational engine to guide reinforcement learning. Machine learning has made possible the development of statistical models to establish effect sizes of clinical interventions, enabling personalized instruction and support to health team members based on patient outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop the technical functionality of its cohort recruitment tool that will advance efforts to launch a production quality substance abuse disorder (SUD) research platform designed for use by addiction researchers at universities, academic medical centers, and commercial sector where U.S. publicly-funded research on addictions exceeds $1.4 billion per year. The project will enable the company to contribute directly to broader societal goals of reducing the negative effects and costs of substance abuse, addiction, and treatment services to individuals from all sectors of society (e.g., minorities, veterans, etc.) by enabling addiction researchers to surface novel and more effective addiction recovery supports and interventions essential to enhancing health outcomes and controlling health care costs. The enhanced functionality will provide SUD researchers and stakeholders a unique platform to study and leverage existing evidence to improve treatment protocols, policies, and financing to improve addiction recovery outcomes. Developing the product will enable the company to combine its large mobile recovery community with state-of-the-art research tools that provide significant value to addiction researchers and demonstrate effectiveness to public and private health insurers ? two important target customers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will aid researchers in surfacing novel technical interventions and support scientific methods to improve population health outcomes. Although technologies are emerging to help address recovery support, these have not yet met their full potential for addressing the needs of people striving 24/7 to stay sober, the needs of practitioners including SUD researchers intent on supporting their recovery, and the desire for health insurers to incentivize best practices and to improve health and control costs. The research objectives include expanding on its proof-of-concept for a cohort recruitment tool by building, testing, and implementing a production-ready open-source research platform with enhanced features for conducting scientific studies including participant assessment and intervention scheduling, advanced cohort selection and prospective assignment features, automated study management features, a white label comparison app, highly scalable architecture enabling very large studies, flexible data hosting and management capabilities, and secure software update infrastructure. The result will be an extensible, scalable, and open-source software tool for conducting a broad variety of scientifically rigorous behavioral research studies, including clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a breakthrough power source for small electronic devices that will move the reality of smart cities and smart rural areas closer to the vision. The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the 'Internet-of-Things' vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures.

    The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of "things" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    \ threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives,\

    \ or range benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for\
    \ technologies that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled\
    \ from the dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development\
    \ of the ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that\
    \ enables Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol\
    \ and methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel\
    \ combustion. Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol\
    \ and ethanol obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric\
    \ air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx\
    \ (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any\
    \ market dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture,\
    \ rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with,\
    \ OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results\
    \ have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out\
    \ soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling\
    \ under the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. \n\nThis Small Business\
    \ Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS.\
    \ The Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation,\
    \ alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric\
    \ combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to\
    \ achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low\
    \ emissions. This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and\
    \ demonstrate the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using\
    \ CFD modeling and engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared\
    \ to the Diesel baseline. The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder\
    \ heavy-duty engine to simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss\
    \ of efficiency, while also achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions\
    \ that are compatible with low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the\
    \ same system that enables gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner\
    \ than Diesel). A Phase II prototype demonstration would realize a longtime industry\
    \ goal of integrating three-way catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing\
    \ Diesel-style engines to achieve the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives\
    \ (like natural gas).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been\

    \ ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet\
    \ extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on\
    \ extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the\
    \ ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise\
    \ in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet\
    \ 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs\
    \ by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and\

    \ (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior\
    \ work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source\
    \ firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively\
    \ tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used\

    \ tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and\
    \ social emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has\
    \ shown that early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is\
    \ critical for success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable,\
    \ underserved social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school,\
    \ including those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each\
    \ of which disproportionately impact children from racial and ethnic minority\
    \ groups. The game being developed by this project empowers educators to provide\
    \ that much needed social emotional learning support for their young students.\
    \ First, it provides an affordable, feasible, and scaleable means for identifying\
    \ the social emotional needs of young students as they transition to formal schooling.\
    \ Second, it enables educators to quickly translate this formative assessment\
    \ data into personalized, digital intervention that can be applied with K1 students\
    \ on a much broader scale than is possible with traditional, in-person services.\
    \ And lastly, because this innovation is game-based and fun, students are more\
    \ likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded instruction. \n\n\
    \nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent Tutoring System\
    \ (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social emotional instruction\
    \ to all students. Within academic domains such as science and mathematics, many\
    \ successful ITS implementations have employed learning models where answers to\
    \ problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented. However,\
    \ traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like social\
    \ emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and what\
    \ the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several significant\
    \ innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but may also\
    \ be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations are\
    \ represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively\
    \ enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more\
    \ student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,\
    \ leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance\
    \ the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition\
    \ to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from\
    \ this SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop a medical device for valve replacement treatment of chronic insufficiency of the veins (CVI). Currently, no definitive treatment option exists to address the underlying cause of the disease, valvular reflux, which leaves millions of patients with chronic venous ulcers, skin thickening, and pain for years to decades. When brought to market, the proposed novel prosthetic valve and delivery system will provide a viable curative therapy superior to current treatment options and mitigating complications associated with existing valve prostheses, such as thrombosis and valve incompetence. The proposed product will curtail substantial health care expenditures associated with CVI, such as wound care, hospitalizations for infections, and associated secondary procedures. Because implantation of this valve does not require the complex or invasive surgical interventions of existing technologies, its use also will avoid expenses associated with open surgical procedures and rehabilitative care. The commercialization of this innovation is expected to benefit CVI patients, while significantly reducing costs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel, reliable, and marketable prosthetic valve and delivery system for the treatment of incompetent veins. In Phase I, a design was created for a device that exceeded laboratory and animal benchmarks. Phase II proposed development improves the design for broader deployment by demonstrating the the valve's ability to minimize thrombosis as well as the capability to be produced at scale. Phase II objectives are to:  1) Develop and produce the next generation valve for in vitro and animal testing; 2) Compare safety of valve designs in an in vitro study; 3) Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the leading design in a chronic animal study; 4) Complete biocompatibility testing on the design to ensure it is appropriate for human testing; and 5) Establish manufacturability of the device. These steps will provide the foundation for future clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in humans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will advance the development of a device to eliminate complications associated with maintenance hemodialysis, a life-sustaining therapy for patients suffering from renal failure.  Hemodialysis (HD) enables blood to be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be repeated at regular intervals and thus requires repeated, high flow access to circulating blood. Adverse events due to mode of access and device failure are frequent, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars per year and leading to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Currently, no technology on the market addresses dialysis graft needle injury or graft material degradation due to needle trauma.  The proposed device will minimize injury levels and decrease the probability of serious complications for chronic HD patients.

    The proposed Phase II SBIR project will advance a technology for prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) for hemodialysis.  The general principle is to engineer a graft with a backplate material optimized for rigidity to prevent needle injury, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to maximize optimal flow.  The technical objectives include: 1) systems engineering to optimize the cost and performance trade space; 2) advanced biocompatibility testing; 3) design verification and validation testing.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project proposes continued development of a directional microwave ablation (MWA) system. During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicator’s tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.

    As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on the preparation of new iron-based compounds as safer contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an issue that particularly affects patients who have frequent MRI scans and those with chronic kidney disease.  This project will advance the development of safer medical imaging.

    This STTR Phase II project will focus on further development of the first Fe(III) macrocycle-based T1 MRI contrast agents as alternatives to Gd(III) agents. The macrocyclic ligands in these complexes are used to control the spin and oxidation state of the iron, as well as the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic clearance of the agent.  The macrocyclic ligands will be modified to further increase T1 relaxivity of the Fe(III) complexes. The hydrophicility of the complexes will be increased to better mimic the clearance profiles of Gd(III) based agents. Scale-up of the synthetic procedures will produce sufficient compound batches for toxicity studies in mice, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the no adverse effect level (NOAEL), imaging studies in rats, as well as histology and metabolic panels.  The most promising complexes will be subjected to further toxicity studies including Ames testing, thymidine kinase cell screens and cardiotoxicity assays.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is an improved treatment for patients suffering from glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting 3.4 million Americans and 80 million people worldwide. The global glaucoma surgery devices market will reach $1.74 billion by 2024, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. In the U.S., glaucoma incurs over $4 billion in medical and societal costs annually. For patients with glaucoma, elevated eye pressure must be lowered to prevent optic nerve damage. However, conventional surgical implant treatments are bulky, highly invasive, and cause chronic discomfort. Newer, smaller devices are less invasive but affect long-term efficacy as they inadequately sustain lower eye pressure when scarring occurs. This project will develop an implant many times thinner than a human hair to safely reduce eye pressure while minimizing patient discomfort and failure from scarring. The device will facilitate patient comfort and surgical ease through a combination of mechanical and materials engineering. Beyond glaucoma, the technology will play a key role in future permanent and efficacious ocular implants - a rapidly growing component of vision care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues development of an ultrathin implant to treat glaucoma. Specifically, this project will optimize a novel corrugated microstructure with a unique combination of mechanical and fluid flow properties. These characteristics provide the implant with stiffness required for handling, flexibility to conform to soft eye tissues, and flow properties for controlling intraocular pressure. Devices will be fabricated using improved micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) methods and validated on a new instrument designed to evaluate flow resistance. This project will conduct biocompatibility, toxicology, and performance studies, monitoring intraocular pressure, levels of inflammation, adverse events, and implant stability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve diagnosis of pediatric otitis media (ear infection).  Otitis media is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children and the second most common pediatric physician appointment.  It is estimated that more than 90% of children will suffer at least one case of otitis media before age 5.  Despite its prevalence, there may be less than 60% diagnostic accuracy in primary care where the vast majority of cases are seen.  Current clinical diagnostics have proven inadequate to address over-prescription of antibiotics and unnecessary specialist and surgical referrals. Otitis media is typically diagnosed using an otoscope to view the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and assess visual signs of an infection.  Otoscope designs have changed little since the 1800’s.  This SBIR Phase II project advances a novel device that integrates clinical standard otoscopy with a novel technique to non-invasively assess ear health using light in real time and with 98% accuracy.  This new otoscope has the potential to create a new standard of care in diagnosis and management of otitis media, and stands to save billions in direct healthcare costs through more accurate diagnosis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a device providing clinicians with an objective, real-time indicator of ear health during standard otoscopy.  At the push of a button, the LED driven measurement will provide an instantaneous, accurate indication of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE) – the most sensitive and specific indicator of acute otitis media per established clinical guidelines.  This project will meet the desired technical specifications of sufficiently sensitive visualization capabilities and reducing measurement time from 1.4 seconds to less than 300 milliseconds.  This project will also: 1) Optimize manufacturability and assembly; 2) Develop a standard automated calibration system; and 3) Conduct standard electronic, photobiologic, and biocompatibility testing for safety and regulatory purposes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new optical imaging techniques for evaluating the health of skin, teeth and gums. Optical imaging uses light instead of X-rays to produce detailed images of tissues. It has not yet been widely applied for dental and dermatology applications because the light does not penetrate deeply enough into tissues to be useful, and these devices are prohibitively expensive to manufacture. This project will develop a a new imaging scheme that allows deeper penetration into tissues, providing more useful diagnostic information; and with current 3D manufacturing techniques, it could cost roughly ten times less than the current alternatives. This technology will enable new safe, affordable imaging processes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances translation of a novel optical technique, dual axis deep imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT), for clinical imaging of skin and teeth. Translation of OCT is advanced for retinal imaging but has not enjoyed the same success in other applications.  This project will create new instruments for dentistry and dermatology by demonstrating: 1) how dual axis OCT can penetrate more deeply in biological tissues using instruments designed for each application; and 2) the economic feasibility using 3D manufacturing and system design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to identify potential therapies for a multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Newly diagnosed MM is typically sensitive to a variety of therapies, but relapse is common in later stages.  Personalized analysis would improve treatment decisions.  This project will develop new testing for personalized medicine. Although the initial target is MM, this can potentially be applied to other cancers or diseases.  Personalized medicine can lead to reduced healthcare costs, optimized drug development, and improved patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help develop methods and techniques that will be used to offer new tests for guiding the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The test relies on resolving changes of cancer cells collected from patients upon exposure to various drug options by measuring the mass of individual cells. Today MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the world. Unfortunately, today there are no biomarkers to define therapeutic susceptibility of MM patients to identify a personalized treatment regimen. This project aims to address this problem by developing a high-throughput single-cell mass measurement platform based on suspended microchannel resonators (SMR) to resolve the effects of the drugs on the cancer cells. In this project a new generation of SMR chips with linked single-cell imaging, image processing and cell classification will be developed to analyze a 20-drug panel in three hours.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis, and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer and other diseases.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted surveillance test.  A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals.  This Phase II project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it will enhance the machine-learning-based matching methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve satellite-based agricultural imaging to allow monitoring and managing of broad regions for enhanced sustainability and food security.  The proposed algorithms address noise in satellite data that is caused by the atmosphere.  The method can be used for many types of satellites, providing advantages in efforts to reduce weight and space to control launch cost.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address a major issue in modern remote sensing, atmospherically induced noise in the data. EOS systems look through the atmosphere that distorts spectral relationships of reflectance (ratio of EOS-measured reflected light to the sunlight that would be received were there no atmosphere). The variable atmosphere distorts the data variably so must be corrected to accurately interpret highly useful measures such as agricultural production/yield, photosynthesis, plant water use, plant disease/insect infestations, etc., rendering EOS data unreliable unless corrected. The technical tasks are to: (1) study European Space Agency Sentinel 2 EOS data, (2) migrate the method to NASA/USGS Landsat 8, (3) adapt the method for calibration of the several decades-long Landsat Multispectral Scanner record that cannot otherwise be corrected to surface reflectance, (4) develop a calibration tool for multiple commercial EOS, and (5) develop a fully integrated software system.

    \ Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will be to supply nitrogen sensors\
    \ for wastewater treatment process control and automation, potentially saving\
    \ $600 M per year in electric energy for the U.S. municipal wastewater treatment\
    \ industry. Municipal wastewater treatment processes are based on energy-intensive\

    \ to a lab, with delays in receiving results. By enabling real-time process control\
    \ of the energy-consuming denitrification process, electric energy usage can be\
    \ reduced by 20% or more. The economic impact to each municipal wastewater treatment\
    \ plant is an average energy savings of $200 k per year, with less than 6 months\
    \ payback, and lower operating costs while reducing/preventing out-of-control\
    \ effluent events.  Competing technologies for real-time nitrogen sensors are\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve the use of water for the oil and gas (O&G) industry, especially during hydraulic fracturing, transforming the industry into a producer of fresh water and changing produced water from its current status as a waste product to a commodity. The proposed technology creates two reusable products: purified water and heavy brine. In addition to the high cost, disposal of produced water through deep injection wells has recently been linked to seismic activity and may impact groundwater quality, prompting policy solutions.  The O&G industry competes with other water uses, especially in US arid regions where significant O&G production occurs. Produced water, contaminated with salts, hydrocarbons, and metals, is generated each year through O&G production, costing $37B to manage in the U.S. Current demand for global fresh water resources for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes is increasing, primarily due to reduction of water supplies in areas affected by drought, climate change, population growth, and expanding industries, as well as degradation of water quality due to contaminants from industry, flooding, or runoff.  The proposed project will provide a new treatment for water used in O&G production, creating a renewable source of fresh water from otherwise unusable wastewater or impacted water sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance the development of an innovative thermal distillation treatment system for produced water generated during O&G production. Current treatment technologies, like reverse osmosis, cannot handle the high-total dissolved solids (TDS) content of most produced water, and thus only a small portion may be reused currently. Disposal is generally through permitted deep injection wells, with water transportation typically serving as the largest disposal cost component. The proposed system accomplishes the entire thermal distillation process in one piece of equipment - a technological advance over state-of-practice thermal distillation units requiring separate energy sources, heat transfer, distillation, separation, and condensation units. It reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, and it uses less energy in operation.  The system can be set up on-site at the well, eliminating the need to transport produced water off-site for disposal. The proposed treatment process yields two reusable products: (1) purified water, which may be sold for use at the well site, sold for agriculture/industrial uses, or discharged to surface waters; and (2) heavy brine, which may be sold as a drilling fluid.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a novel waterless rock fracturing technology that can replace hydraulic fracturing in the future.  Hydraulic fracturing requires pumping of millions of gallons of water into a reservoir to create permeable pathways within the rock, and increase hydrocarbon recovery rates. However, hydraulic fracturing technology has been banned in some regions within the United States, and in various countries across the globe due to water scarcity and environmental concerns. This has left trillions of dollars in petroleum resources trapped within the earth, negatively impacting the global economy. The waterless fracturing technology being developed under this project utilizes pulsed electrical energy to fracture rocks instead of water, allowing for hydrocarbons to be recovered with minimum environmental impact. The research conducted during this project will provide further insights into the advantages of utilizing electricity to fracture petroleum reservoirs and assist in accelerating successful commercialization of the technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel electric reservoir stimulation method to increase reservoir permeability without requiring pumping of hazardous material into the subsurface. This project will advance the development of an electric stimulation method by testing it on rock samples under higher pressure and temperature conditions, to mimic the downhole conditions of several common petroleum reservoirs and allow for optimization. This project will also include the design of a downhole tool that will be utilized to carry electrical current from the surface to the target reservoir for field demonstrations of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred 'significant' pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas delivery services. Such events can have severe consequences for a utility including bankruptcy, billions of dollars in liabilities, civil/criminal penalties and higher insurance premiums. This proposed scalable and economical capability to proactively identify potential issues prior to catastrophic failure will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures without requiring additional infrastructure. The project will also help prevent unauthorized third-party activity near pipelines, a leading cause of accidents. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grids, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, temperature, and network characteristics. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur for various reasons, such as sulphur or ice buildup, regulator malfunction, corrosion/aging of hardware, and human error. Such failures are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. Early detection of such signatures with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more) allows corrective action that will avoid loss of life, property damage and service disruption. This project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from real-time pipeline data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties unique to network-level gas-pressure time series. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into failure type, allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations. The project will also develop scalable automated high-dimensional classification models to detect construction activity from satellite and other image data, to initiate preventive action.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to save significant amounts of water at power plants and other industrial facilities, potentially saving hundreds of billions of gallons of water every year in the US. This will help reduce the water footprint of power generation and other cooling applications, reduce operating expenses for these facilities, and increase the reliability of power generation. The annual savings can be several millions of dollars per facility and the market opportunity in the US is estimated at around $4 B. Furthermore, this technology can be used for upcycling the captured water from cooling towers that use wastewater or seawater, potentially producing pure distilled water for commercial and domestic use.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance a water capture technology for cooling tower plumes. The proposed technology uses electric fields to ionize the air around a cooling tower outlet, charge the water escaping cooling towers, and direct it toward a mesh-based collector and ultimately a collection tank on the periphery of the cooling tower. The Phase II proposal includes both systematic experimental studies to optimize the collection setup for real-world deployment, as well as material choice and durability studies. This project will optimize the design and build a pilot system, including a control panel designed for compatibility with existing systems.  Data collected from the pilot installation on collection efficiency, water quality, and power consumption will be used to iterate and improve the design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide domestic production of renewable, biomass-based alternatives to products currently made from oil.  This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the commercial potential of producing 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), a key chemical used to manufacture coatings, adhesives, and plastics, from agricultural wastes like corn cobs. Biomass-based chemicals can decrease the nation's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing cost-competitive high-performance chemical products. Creating high-value commodity chemicals using nonfood agricultural materials as feedstock promises to create new markets for bio-based waste products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will generate the necessary experimental data to design commercial reactors for producing renewable bio-based 1,5-pentanediol. A chemical pathway to produce bio-based 1,5-pentanediol has been demonstrated in laboratory reactors using commercially relevant reactors and catalysts.  In this work a wide range of reactor operating conditions will be explored in the laboratory for scale-up of the process. These operating conditions will be further demonstrated in larger pilot-scale equipment to inform design at commercial scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help total knee replacement patients who have a joint infection.  Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of a total joint replacement. Beyond immediate treatment, infections can develop years later from unrelated injuries, increasing PJI incidence as older patients opt for replacement joints. Roughly 15.6 million people in the US currently use a replacement joint, and without improved treatment, PJI will represent an estimated $2.2 billion annual US healthcare burden by 2023.  The current standard of care treatment cannot generate sufficiently high antibiotic concentrations within the joint over enough time to eradicate bacterial biofilms on the implant and tissue, the known cause of persistent infection.  This project will advance a proprietary implantable drug delivery system to easily generate and maintain an antibiotic concentration in the joint sufficient to eradicate biofilm and resolve an infection with less surgical trauma, easier patient recovery and lower healthcare cost than the current standard of care provides.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a novel implantable drug delivery system with an externally worn controller that communicates through skin to a simple implant comprising a pump and reservoir.  When therapy is complete the pump can be left in place with no requirement to remove it, avoiding additional surgery common with current implantable pump technology.   This project advances the development of the implant and controller to generate prototypes for thorough testing, including efficacy evaluation for biofilm eradication within a simulated environment.

    This broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop low-cost, biodegradable biopolymers to replace non-degradable, single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.  Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.

    The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability of a novel reactive extrusion technology, capable of producing biodegradable and compostable thermoplastics with lignin contents of at least 50 weight percent, using solvent-free reactive processing. The polymer alloys will have mechanical properties comparable to commodity polymers, such as low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and thermophilic composting conditions in under 6 months. These materials will be validated for commercial scale production using twin-screw extruders, converted to raw material feedstocks used in plastics manufacturing including filament, pellets, and sheet, and then converted with standard equipment into products such as containers for agriculture, floral, and forestry plant production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the enablement of next generation manufacturing technologies for semiconductor devices. The deployment of novel semiconductor devices such as 3D NAND, the latest device architecture developed for flash memory, is often stymied by the development of nanomanufacturing processes. The objective of this proposal is to build upon a recipe prediction platform to create a standalone software solution for semiconductor equipment and chip manufacturers to rapidly optimize their processes.  In this research, the software speed will be increased, prediction capabilities will be extended to 3D structures, and model calibration will be automated to facilitate customer deployment. By accelerating the development of the processes used in device fabrication, this project reduces the cost of recipe development in the semiconductor industry and bringing next-generation technologies to fruition.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new advanced physical and statistical models to quickly and accurately predict outcomes for processes like plasma etch and deposition. In this research, 2D and 3D profile simulations will be algorithmically optimized for speed to give process engineers instantaneous results. Machine learning models will be used to enable process engineers to rapidly explore complex trade spaces. Sophisticated numerical algorithms will be developed to help engineers maximize process windows. Innovations in statistical and physics-based tools will permit process engineers to build and calibrate models themselves, enabling next-generation technologies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance the development of a self-cleaning window glass coating with the same appearance as bare glass. The improved performance and decreased cost will enable its use in applications beyond residential and commercial windows, such as outdoor displays and solar modules, dramatically increasing the potential overall market opportunity.  More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve many properties of surfaces used in wide-ranging applications from computer chips to clothing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a high-performance photocatalytic self-cleaning coating on glass. Present photocatalytic coatings typically utilize dense titanium dioxide, that increases the reflectance of the glass because of its high refractive index.  Initial work has demonstrated coatings of controllable refractive index deposited with a new coating technology, Aerosol Impact-Driven Assembly (AIDA).  This project will scale a multilayered, multicomponent coating that addresses the photocatalytic activity/transmittance trade-off. The coating will have industry-leading photocatalytic activity and transmittance higher than the current state-of-the-art at lower costs. More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve the optical, thermal, electronic, chemical, and adhesive properties of surfaces for many applications.  Research objectives include optimization of the durability and outdoor performance of this coating by refining the deposition hardware and the coating structure, demonstration of the scalability of the AIDA process by depositing coatings on larger substrates, and quantification of the performance metrics required for infusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is enabling increased throughput and quality in semiconductor, chemical and biochemical manufacturing. The ability to monitor pressure from atmosphere to ultra-high vacuum is a critical need for these industries. This need is currently addressed by using combinations of vacuum monitoring technologies that, in many cases, require the high cost of employing multiple devices for a single job, allowing for multiple failure modes, and increasing the space constraints on the manufacturing equipment.  Errors in accuracy in current systems can lead to lower production yields and failures due to exposure of fragile elements to atmospheric pressure can lead to higher maintenance costs and lower process availability. In this context, this new technology offers a substantial commercial benefit across several large-scale manufacturing industries.  This technology will be further leveraged for other large-scale verticals such as mass spectrometry and radiation detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will exploit ultrasensitive ion-sensing properties of low-power graphene sensors combined with voltage-controlled ion sources and resetting mechanisms for vacuum sensing. The core scientific breakthrough that underpins this technology is an ultrahigh intrinsic charge-to-current amplification mechanism inherently present in the graphene sensors.  This results in measurable changes in electrical conductance caused by the attachment of trace quantities of ions on the sensors. The nonlinear nature of the charge-to-current amplification scales to higher values at lower ion-flux rates, thereby allowing greater effective sensitivity at lower pressures.  In addition, combining these sensors with voltage-tunable ion sources and appropriate resetting mechanisms enables stable, long-term operation over a wide range of operating vacuum pressure.  Manufacturing sensors at the chip scale allows for multi-sensor readout for improved signal and reproducible behavior, along with resilience against failure. Taken together, these technological innovations will allow the development of high-performance vacuum gauges for diverse applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help enable the expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) through new peel-and-stick sensor nodes.  Such IoT nodes require low device cost, and thus low sub-component costs for sensing elements, processing circuits, communications, and power. In addition, they are power constrained, requiring minimal energy consumption during sensor data collection, processing, and transmission. Integrating low-cost and low-power components into a single size-limited device becomes a substantial challenge using conventional semiconductor fabrication materials and processes. This SBIR Phase II project will use a novel System-on-Foil approach that patterns efficient silicon circuitry directly into a novel flexible silicon substrate, alongside low-cost printed electronics. This approach enables the integration of all core IoT elements, including microprocessors, sensors, antennas, interconnects, and power supplies, making robust systems with applications in condition monitoring for civil infrastructure, human health monitoring, automotive, grid battery management, wind turbines, aerospace, and industrial equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel semiconductor recrystallization technology to support a new generation of flexible electronics. To include on-board processing, communication, and memory circuitry, current state-of-the-art flexible electronics rely on surface mounting and soldering of off-the-shelf silicon chips, similar to rigid printed circuit board assemblies. This pick-and-place approach not only reduces device flexibility, but also leads to interconnection challenges that severely compromise device reliability.  This project leverages a thin film recrystallization process where equivalent silicon circuits can now be patterned directly into flexible silicon, resulting in a highly scalable manufacturing process that drastically improves device reliability. By patterning all components directly into a high-temperature substrate, conformal electronics can be made that are durable even in heavy vibration and shock environments.  The project objectives include the transition of prototype recrystallization processes to a higher throughput and higher quality pilot-scale recrystallization system. The resulting flexible silicon substrates will then be used for preliminary development of integrated circuit fabrication to produce active silicon components as a step toward fully patterned System-on-Foil electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is addressing the growing societal need for indoor air purification, as indoor air quality (IAQ) directly affects human health, productivity, cognitive function, and quality-of-life. Awareness of the long-term consequences of poor IAQ has recently witnessed an increase due to research results, improvements in monitoring and sensing technology, public awareness campaigns by organizations such as the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, and Environmental Protection Agency, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding sustainable, economical, and effective solutions to the problem of poor IAQ will greatly benefit public health and wellbeing and will help curtail the spread of pathogens, minimizing the need for social distancing.  This project will develop a new system air purification, addressing viruses, harmful chemicals, odors, and ultrafine particulates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to scale up the production methodology and coating process of novel catalytic materials. The materials are 3D nanostructured porous powders that are designed at multiple length scales to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and longevity, while reducing costs and utilizing raw materials in an environmentally responsible manner. The system uses a synthetic approach based on self-organization of nanoscale building blocks and wet chemistry tools in order to assemble finely structured coatings for integration in air-purification units. This project focuses on expanding it to production scale, wherein achieving control over the composition, structure, porosity, and placement of nanoparticles on a production scale is challenging.  The materials platform development will include adaptation to high-throughput instrumentation and scale-up of the material production and coating process to pilot production. In the process, this project will develop tools and guidelines for manufacturing hierarchically-structured functional materials more generally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the replacement of steel with synthetic materials that are stronger and lighter. The beachhead market for this technology is the performance bicycle spoke market, which is a $180M global market. The potential benefits of this technology go beyond cycling because the polymer-to-metal interface has other potential applications. Cable assemblies are used in a wide variety of applications and industries such as industrial, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods. Advances in the termination of synthetic cable assemblies will enable the creation of higher strength-to-weight ratio cables and thereby increase efficiencies in transportation applications and improve the safety of tension based systems. An application of particular societal benefit is wheelchair wheels, where weight reduction increases portability for those with physical disabilities. Investment in termination technologies for high performance polymers will also help bridge the gap between polymer research and industry, helping society benefit from developments in polymer science occurring in academia. Finally, the ability to produce low-cost rope terminations will increase US manufacturing competitiveness because the majority of high-volume production is outsourced to low-cost labor markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced manufacturing process for ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and metal hybrid structures for bicycle spokes. UHMWPE has a strength-to-weight ratio of fifteen times that of steel, but it cannot be utilized in many applications because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-strength bonds to metal. The primary objectives of this research are to automate the insertion and bonding of stainless steel rods inside the hollow cavity of braided fibers, and to automate the creation of eye splices. These operations require delicate manipulation of fibers in a confined space, and are typically performed manually. Instead, we will develop novel automatic machinery that will create these bonds, inspect the final product, and validate the strength with 100% in-process inspection. Another objective of this research is to develop a black surface coating process for braided UHMWPE fibers. To achieve this, we will identify a surface pretreatment procedure to add functionality to the non-polar backbone of UHMWPE, develop the coating chemistry, and create an in-line coating system that integrates with our manufacturing process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to optimize a system to rapidly synthesize long, user-defined sequences of DNA as a commercial service. The process will be capable of producing error-free DNA fragments, each long enough to encode multiple genes, in 1-2 weeks, at a price that will be affordable even to university research labs. Researchers currently can purchase short DNA fragments that must be stitched together to make functional genes – which is labor-intensive and sometimes impossible – or pay vendors to do it. The ability to buy an intact group of genes on one piece of DNA will help deepen the understanding of all biological systems, from animals and plants to the bacteria and viruses that infect them. Easy access to long DNAs will also allow synthetic biologists to build completely novel biological devices, such as bacteria that manufacture vitamins or medicines, cells that detect and destroy cancer, or new sustainable food ingredients and novel biomaterials.

    The proposed project is focused on developing an enzymatic method for DNA synthesis that will alleviate several problems inherent to chemical DNA synthesis, the only method currently available commercially. Chemical synthesis works well for short DNA fragments, but high-quality synthesis is limited to <200 bases. Longer fragments often are created by stitching together many short fragments, but this process is unreliable for sequences that contain repeats or high AT or GC content. In the proposed enzymatic DNA synthesis method, a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is conjugated to the template-independent polymerase Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) by a cleavable linker. When presented with a DNA primer, the dNTP-TdT conjugate adds its tethered nucleotide and remains attached, blocking further elongation by other conjugates. Cleavage of the linker releases the TdT, to be washed away with unreacted conjugates, and exposes the oligo for extension with the next dNTP-TdT conjugate. These two steps of “extension” and “deprotection” are iterated to synthesize a defined sequence. The accuracy of the resulting DNA strand depends on the stability and cleavage efficiency of the linker. A variety of linkages and cleavage enzymes will be tested to yield >99.9% stability and cleavage in rapid, 30-second reactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a software application that identifies clinical outcomes to support high validity real-world evidence (RWE). Approaches to ensure data accuracy and protocol validity are critical to maintain safety and efficacy in healthcare.  This project will analyze electronic health data to generate clinically meaningful information for personalized treatment plans for patients with multiple conditions that can confound treatment. This technology will fulfill an unmet need to improve patient outcomes, improve healthcare delivery and chronic disease care management, and reduce healthcare costs for patients. This technology can also improve regulatory and reimbursement decision-making for therapeutic approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the need for consideration of using additional health data to allow for individualized personalized therapeutic plans for patients with multiple co-morbidities. Subgroup analysis or individualized therapy plans for precision medicine are currently not available based upon the structure of randomized controlled trials for broad conditions like breast cancer or hypertension. This proposal seeks to identify clinical outcomes from unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR). The proposed work is to develop analytics using natural language processing and inference to leverage the large amounts of health data from real-world evidence (RWE) and observational studies to augment data provided in randomized controlled trials (RCT). The analytic tools will allow a comparison of the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in defined cohorts of patients and develop a personalized treatment plan for an individual patient with multiple co-morbidities. The tasks include: 1) Leverage linguistic phrases extracted by natural language processing (NLP) to recognize outcome-related clinical findings to be maintained as clinical feature metadata; 2) Combine NLP and inference to accurately identify candidate clinical outcomes; and 3) Apply machine-learned and expert knowledge to accurately define complex outcome measures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, high-performance platform to monitor and characterize plankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be harmful or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns and economic consequences, such as billions lost annually in the aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms and sea lice. The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collections and evaluation. In contrast, the proposed platform may enable low-cost, portable and fast monitoring, as well as automated characterization of harmful aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, this platform will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets such as marine biology science and STEM education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, and production algae monitoring. The proposed technology is envisioned to have a significant societal impact and commercial potential.

    This project may result in a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput aquatic microobjects monitoring instrument.  The instrument will have a wide spectrum of applications and initial focus on aquaculture market. The technology will initially focus on early identification of specific microorganisms, such as sea lice and harmful algae as they are detrimental to the wellbeing of aquaculture animals. This demonstration will provide high quality data at an affordable price to ensure confidence and credibility to aquaculture farmers, marine scientists, and other users interested in aquatic microobjects characterization. To accomplish this plan, several operating regimes will be implemented enabling the device to switch from high-resolution (monitoring harmful algae) to high-throughput (identifying sea lice).  An autofluorescent camera module will be developed to further assist with differentiating microorganisms. Next, an innovative neural network framework will be developed and tested for identification of different types of sea lice and harmful algae. Finally, the system will be integrated into an environmentally protected enclosure and rigorously tested in laboratory, as well as in-field in realistic conditions. At the end of the Phase II program a prototype will be completed that will be designed in coordination with aquaculture partners and prospective users.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient system for robust point-of-care blood tests.  The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and represent a bottleneck.  This Phase II effort will explore the design and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated by comparison
    of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead separation assay with a conventional centrifugation process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology, based on naturally occurring small molecules proven to strongly activate plant’s natural defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed innovation is active at extremely low concentrations, can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic. Every year, approximately 500 million kg of more than 600 different chemical pesticide types are used; this costs an estimated $10 billion and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests and pathogens. By providing an alternative, effective method for managing diseases in crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals, synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance development. The proposed research will establish viability of a natural small molecule as a crop protectant and can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides and significantly enhancing global food security.

    The proposed project seeks to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small, naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants. The proposed project will demonstrate a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy under field conditions, adversely affecting neither seed germination/ growth nor natural microbe/insect populations. The project objectives are to 1) Perform multi-location field trials with wheat and soybean against three high-impact pathogens to confirm efficacy of seed treatments; 2) Conduct greenhouse studies to investigate potential synergies of seed and spray treatments, including in combination with other crop protection agents; 3) Determine effects of seed or spray treatments on nematode infestation in soybean; 4) Scale chemical synthesis of the active ingredient and optimize the seed-coating formulation.

    \ Phase II project is to help patients living with diabetes. The disease accounts\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device supporting multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. The success of this project would not only benefit patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce health care expenditures by decreasing the length of hospitalization as well as associated medical resources. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research brings together academic collaborators from different fields of expertise. The project provides a unique experience and training for engineers and scientists in the fields of neural interface design and medical device experiments, bridging the gap between the engineering and medical communities, as well as promoting and cultivating future neural engineers to focus on developing emerging/unmet diagnostic and therapeutic devices for improving human health.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops and demonstrates a wireless, miniaturized, intraluminal bioelectronic capsule capable of performing on-demand neuromodulation and multi-modality sensing on the gastrointestinal tract, supporting closed-loop neuromodulation. The device will be tested and characterized on benchtop and also through porcine models to demonstrate its potential for treating and monitoring post-surgical complications. The lengthy process of diagnosing and treating post-surgical complications significantly increases healthcare costs. Costs from hospitalization time alone exceed $2,000 per day for post-operative ileus alone.  Additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could reduce hospitalization time, accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life for patients. The success of this project has the potential to bring disruptive impact and revolution to the current pharmaceutical-based post-surgical management and treatment. In addition, the technology developed during this project may be useful to treat other chronic diseases and injuries that are incurable pharmaceutically.  The technique may be used as research tools for investigating the biological mechanisms and new therapeutics for different diseases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting parameters. Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually.  However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients’ quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help advance the health and welfare of individuals living with retinal and neurological disease. This includes multiple sclerosis (MS)—a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A fully automated, wearable, and low-cost retinal imaging device will be developed for use in both clinical and home settings that detects changes in the retina, allowing patients and their physicians to more routinely track treatment efficacy and ocular side effects. Early detection and treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and positively impact the research and care of other retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal pathology. While OCT is a widely-used modality for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for unsupervised use by patients at home. This includes a ruggedized and ergonomic design suited for those who suffer from low vision, low mobility, and other symptoms that make frequent trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly as often as prescribed by their doctor, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Complete development of a clinical-grade beta prototype that is suitable for use in clinical and home settings, 2) Develop a software pipeline for automated image analysis and report, and 3) Conduct a usability study in a cohort of AMD patients with varying degrees of vision loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20% and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776 million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, 11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain diabetic foot ulcers each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible, robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the prototype and scale up hardware production.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project falls within the scope of the grand challenges\
    \ in health informatics. There are excellent protocols for the management and\
    \ treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once\
    \ patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Ischemic stroke affects\
    \ 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth\
    \ leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Health care\
    \ providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these\
    \ interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting.\
    \ Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited tools to help\
    \ patients recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients\
    \ with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke\
    \ symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor\
    \ patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide\
    \ coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom\
    \ monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through\
    \ their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will\
    \ allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders\
    \ and diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project\
    \ addresses the real-time detection of stroke.  IV tissue plasminogen activator\
    \ (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible\
    \ patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room after initial\
    \ stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular\
    \ therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours for these treatments,\
    \ respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms\
    \ of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge.\
    \ The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational\
    \ solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency\
    \ response in a timely manner. The solution consists of a cloud-based analysis\
    \ system for real-time detection of stroke onset, enabled by body-worn sensors\
    \ and a mobile app. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve\
    \ stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients arriving in the\
    \ hospital in time for IV tPA treatment and other reperfusion therapies.\n\nThis\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a significant increase to the security of healthcare safe public-private blockchain protocols. The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to improve fruit and vegetable storage and dairy powder production in situations that currently require additives and carrier agents during the high-temperature processing techniques. The creation of novel, high-quality, shelf-stable food products is an important step toward increasing food system sustainability and accessibility.  The team seeks to increase shelf-stability, reducing reliance on the expensive and limited cold chain. This technology has potential applications for pharmaceutical drug preservation. Additionally, global water shortages have increased reliance on desalination technologies that are expensive and environmentally taxing. With the potential cost, scalability, and portability benefits of the proposed separation technology, there is further potential for use in water treatment.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to further develop a hybrid separation technology combining supercritical fluids and sonication to instantly separate a solute and solvent at operational temperatures of 15-55 °C, with inputs as low as 1% solids.  The technology results in products with particles sizes of <10um to >250um and varying crystallization without hardware changes. By creating a continuous separation effect using velocity (supersonic flow as the kinetic driving force for phase separation instead of heat), the technology overcomes the end-product quality limitations of traditional thermal drying techniques, and has the potential to scale with attractive unit economics,.  This method is significantly more energy efficient than existing methodologies. Specifically, the technology can produce pure fruit, vegetable, and dairy powders without preprocessing concentration steps, additives, carrier agents, or thermal treatment.  The method may also be used to develop drug formulations for aerosol delivery and/or enhanced bioavailability, streamline sugar manufacturing to create co-energy generation, and potentially offer cost effective compact desalination systems to make drinkable water. The Phase II research seeks to design, construct, and optimize a scalable pilot system through computational fluid dynamics modeling, custom fabrication, and analytical testing to validate the unit economics and end-product attributes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality and efficiency of bedside spinal access procedures by developing a needle guidance system that interfaces with existing ultrasound machines. Lumbar punctures (LPs) are performed to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as meningitis. The traditional LP technique requires practitioners to manually feel for spinal landmarks to form a mental image of the anatomy before blindly inserting the needle into the spine, aiming for a small target containing spinal fluid. This methodology can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming and is highly dependent on practitioner experience and patient body type. Up to 42% of procedures fail to access the target. Failed cases require radiological intervention, increasing the cost of care, lengthening patient stay, and exposing patients to radiation. Hospitals in the United States lose an estimated $2 billion annually due to inefficiencies and failures in LPs. The proposed needle guidance system will enable bedside spinal access procedures to be performed under real-time ultrasound imaging, significantly improving first-attempt success rates. The guidance technology can further be applied in other clinical segments, improving the quality of care across a variety of needle-based procedures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) Complete development of a needle guidance system designed to interface with existing ultrasound machines; and 2) Develop an AI-powered anatomy detection software feature for the guidance system. These combined objectives will generate a functional, intuitive, and accessible solution that minimizes barriers to adoption while maximizing clinical and operational value. The proposed research involves conducting an array of safety and reliability studies to investigate the performance of the guidance system under realistic conditions. In developing a robust anatomy detection software feature, a spinal ultrasound data set will be created from a variety of non-patient volunteers. The data will be analyzed, processed, and used to train a machine learning model for anatomy detection. It is anticipated that the results of this project will demonstrate a sufficiently safe and efficacious system that can consistently guide a needle to an intended target with an error of less than 3 millimeters. The anatomy detection feature is expected to perform with at least 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity in identifying five key spinal landmarks; this level of performance would significantly reduce the knowledge barrier to performing ultrasound-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to increase the quality of consumer products and services by scaling the data sharing economy. Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are “messy" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with “feature stores,” which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to unleash the potential of water as a thermal energy storage medium for building air conditioning. Today’s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns.  First, materials testing will be completed after a year’s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to close gaps in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) proficiency, improving participation and sustained achievement, particularly for historically underserved student populations. Learning science has validated that the mathematical sciences are processed experientially — through seeing, moving, doing, perceiving — but current educational solutions generally do not explore this learning modality.  This platform will utilize Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and advanced analytics to scale these best practice pedagogies for both students and teachers. The aim of this project is to actualize the vision of technology-assisted STEM learning and operationalize it across the US K-12 system to close long-standing barriers to access and proficiency at scale.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform offers a way to rapidly close significant learning gaps students are facing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate how multimodal and game-driven learning in IVR can be used to enhance math proficiencies and the ability to transfer mathematical knowledge across contexts.  Such abilities have so far eluded incumbent learning technologies and interventions for math. In particular, this research may culminate in an experiential solution for students to learn Algebra efficiently, effectively, and purposefully. Immersed in relevant real-world contexts, students will use tactile 3D tools, movement, and a research-based pedagogical framework to build lasting fluency with math concepts while solving high impact problems. The platform will leverage the latest advances in data analysis to personalize learning experiences based on individual behaviors, skills and goals. This solution provides teachers with real-time data on student thinking so they can closely monitor, identify, and support priority students while providing timely feedback during critical cognitive moments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce a fusion-based engine in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive. The ultimate system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy.  Since the system is small and has low radiation, it also has applications for manned space flight.  This new engine could enable more direct and shorter flights to other planets, which minimizes the exposure of astronauts to the radiation encountered in outer space.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue the companies research on using a harmonic well to produce fusion by particle kinetic energy, rather than general thermal energy. The proposed concept utilizes a new heat engine technique that always maintains the plasma distribution function in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the proposed fusion system, a plasma is created in a specially designed harmonic well and then induced to form into two counter-oscillating spinning rings. When the two rings collide at the center of the well, the particle velocities are high enough to cause fusion.   This phase of the project will increase the energetics of the device. The project will move up to deuterium, a fuel which is twice as heavy as hydrogen (the current fuel) and has a much larger cross-section for fusion. The proposed approach is expected to make the harmonic well sufficiently energetic to produce deuterium-on-deuterium fusion by increasing the natural oscillation frequency of the well to give ion collision speeds of about one million meters per second. The project expects to be able to detect the neutrons produced by the fusion, demonstrating aneutronic fusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves both reduced costs for technology companies as well as increased access to cutting-edge engineering jobs for people from all backgrounds.  Commercializing this product will provide the market with an innovative, automated solution that reduces the time hiring managers spend on recruiting and growing the best candidates.  Until now, metacognitive skill development has been the purview of in-person mentors – a practice that provides fewer on-ramps into engineering careers for individuals from backgrounds historically underrepresented in technology as they often lack access to in-person engineer mentors. A scalable system which delivers metacognitive benefits to users in an automated way may create greater access to technology education by reducing the need for in-person mentorship. The product will also enable job seekers to enhance their engineering potential by strengthening the "hard to teach" practices which distinguish professional engineers from aspiring ones. Overall, the product commercialized during Phase II seeks to increase broader participation in engineering careers and a more equitable set of hiring practices in technology companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project brings cutting-edge Cognitive Science to bear on the problems of manual candidate screening and ongoing employee upskilling. For the first-time, it marries an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and opens the door to build talent pipelines for individuals whose metacognitive traits match closely with the needs of tech employers.  The proposed project combines key advances in the field of Cognitive Science with best practices in software design in order to create novel user interactions inside a Computer-Based Learning Environment (CBLE).  Objectives include: 1) collecting microdata (also called "trace data") from user interactions to make automated inferences about the user's metacognitive traits and 2) creating inputs designed to foster metacognitive growth.  Correlating real-time trace data with metacognitive ability is a new area of research enabled only recently by the increased adoption of CBLEs.  The proposed project contributes to the fields of Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction by validating novel methods measuring metacognition against existing static look-back techniques. The project also pioneers new modes of delivering personalized metacognitive growth through CBLE interaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate development of immunotherapeutics and make them broadly available and affordable to patients in need. Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact.  Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value).

    The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seek to improve the quality of life for manufacturing workers, help U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improve the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells may reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The developed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants perform the low-level tedious tasks. Moreover, this technology enables the human operator to guide the team operation. This ability will improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. performing composite fabrication. Most of these companies face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn. These challenges lead to longer delivery times. This project may  enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, the technology may enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing the reliance on human labor and easily scaling production capacity with the change in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robotic sanding solution for high-mix applications by providing safety under uncertainty during robotic sanding and reducing cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient trajectories by the robot. This award will make computational advances to enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description.  The project will also enable the computational algorithms to account for the uncertainties present in the environment, making robots useful for sanding operations in high-mix applications. A robotic sanding cell for handling large parts in high-mix applications will be developed by selecting the appropriate sensors and tools. Algorithms will be developed for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell while the workpiece is secured with a cost-effective, general-purpose, low-cost fixture. Algorithms will be developed to determine the minimum number of setups needed for sanding large parts in the robotic cell and to generate robot trajectories to produce tool motion patterns that ensure efficient and safe sanding operation.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.  Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks, develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed decisions.

    The research and development activities include: (1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps. These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods, potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaska’s environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-makers.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants, including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over 85%.

    The proposed project turns supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling. Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new markets, such as wastewater treatment.  Recovery of compression energy during SCWO has been demonstrated previously.  This project's goals are to further optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours between major services.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in teaching K-12 and college students STEM concepts in the fun-filled context of designing, building, and programming machines and robots and preparing them for the future technology-driven jobs. This project seeks to make robotics education affordable, equitable, and inclusive for students at all grade levels. By taking a multi-disciplinary and cross-curricula approach, the product developed through this project engages students, especially women and minorities from diverse backgrounds, effectively in STEM disciplines and helps them make suitable career choices. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce and help fill the 2.5 million STEM jobs that are vacant according to the current US Department of Labor Statistics. The technological innovations emerging from this project would result in a computational tool for synthesis of robot motions, which can be used broadly in industrial automation and invention of machines and robots. The proposed design-driven educational robotics product has the potential to improve engagement with science and technology and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to bring together rigid body kinematics, machine learning, and engineering design to create a new product for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools, freshman college programs, and STEM camps. The leading commercially available educational robotic systems emphasize 1) instruction-driven prototyping of robot structures using many specialized parts, and 2) programming them without providing any intuition behind the design process or guidance to creating mechanism design concepts for the realization of the motion of the robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, new science standards, and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This product would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. If successful, this project would result in a state-of-the-art motion design software, a novel hardware kit, and standards-aligned curriculum and learning resources for schools and colleges. The software based on the machine learning in mechanism design research will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide students necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    \ in applications where they markedly outperform their conventional counterparts.\
    \ One such application is point-of-use testing: by switching to hollow metal nanoparticles,\

    \ of detection, improving field testing for environmental contamination; detection\
    \ of toxins and pathogens in agriculture; and early disease identification in\

    \ as the resulting higher sensitivity would reduce the occurrence of false negative\
    \ results, thereby improving the performance (and public perception) of rapid\
    \ testing. Critically, it would also improve baseline testing availability for\
    \ rural and under-served populations who do not have access to PCR-equipped clinical\
    \ laboratories. They can be applied to many other industries as well. \n\nThis\

    \ This project advances a prototype reactor that has demonstrated high-throughput\
    \ production of hollow plasmonic nanoparticles with control over size and color,\
    \ while maintaining structural uniformity (<15% CV). Importantly, it reduced the\
    \ cost of labor per liter of product by 950% from that of small batch synthesis.\
    \ The proposed project will increase fidelity, further scale production volume,\
    \ post-process and stabilize the final product, and benchmark its optical performance.\
    \ The resulting production-scale reactor will have the capacity necessary to supply\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.

    The proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project will be to empower and educate caregivers to make scientifically guided decisions that enable safer and optimally nurturing sleep environments for infants.  Every year more than 130 million babies are born and over 4 million of those are born in the U.S.  Due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 300 babies every month may not live to see their first birthday.  SIDS remains the leading cause of death for babies aged one month to one year.  Infant mortality rates in the U.S. are higher than in the 20 wealthiest nations.  Innogized Technologies has developed a transformative Internet of Things technology (IoT) that combines hardware and analytics to enable caregivers to make better sleep-time decisions, avoiding overheating, a known stressor for SIDS.  The technology guides caregivers to deliver optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth for their infants anywhere and anytime, while at the same time relieving anxiety.  This technology is poised to immediately capture a sizable portion of the rapidly growing $1 billion US baby monitoring solutions market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a novel consumer product that works  with caregivers to proactively mitigate the risk of under/overheating events in newborns. Sleep-time clothing choices are thermodynamically matched with environmental conditions to create baby-specific safe sleep environments.  The temperatures are  maintained by leveraging the inherent connectivity of the IoT platform. The technology integrates thermal resistance measurements, thermal models and maps, advanced algorithms, and predictive monitoring.  The research objectives of the project tackle the most important remaining technical challenges driving towards successful commercialization and adoption of a product that is essentially an intelligent system, capable of understanding context and tracking and managing complex interactions while anticipating requirements.  The technical product of this research will advance caregiver knowledge and increase understanding of the applied thermodynamics leading to the advantageous state of thermoneutrality as well as increase infant wellbeing.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    \ Phase II project is to address health concerns associated with peanut allergies.\
    \ Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for\
    \ those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut\
    \ allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising\
    \ incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free\
    \ peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen\
    \ the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits:\
    \ (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives\
    \ by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut,\
    \ (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their\
    \ families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting\
    \ food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination.\
    \ \n \nThe proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free\
    \ peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing\
    \ tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\
    \ and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after\
    \ contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound\
    \ to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut\
    \ allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for\
    \ the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h\
    \ 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens.\
    \ The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara\
    \ h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut\
    \ plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble\
    \ lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize\
    \ the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative\
    \ development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions. If the resulting\
    \ plants demonstrate tolerance to the gene deletions, the allergen-free peanut\
    \ will be very significant in protecting the peanut sensitive populations and\
    \ promoting peanut sales.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has\
    \ been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual\
    \ merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a universal protein sample preparation\
    \ kit that extracts proteins from any biological sample, removes contaminants,\
    \ and prepares them for downstream analytical methods with higher yields and deeper\
    \ coverage than currently available technology.  Proteins are the molecular machines\
    \ of the cell that do all the work required to keep humans healthy, and incorporation\
    \ of protein analysis is becoming increasingly important for developing a clear\
    \ understanding of integrated biological systems, realizing the promise of precision\
    \ medicine, and rapid drug discovery. Sample preparation is the first step in\
    \ any protein-based project workflow and without a high-yield, fast, and reproducible\
    \ way to prepare samples, downstream analyses are difficult to interpret and highly\
    \ variable, leading to long project times and wasted resources.  The proposed\
    \ innovation improves sample yields, reproducibility, and speed, accelerating\
    \ research seeking to discover new therapies and diagnostics and improving cost-effectiveness.\
    \  It will also purify other important biomolecules from the same sample, such\
    \ as DNA, RNA, and metabolites, allowing researchers to obtain more information\
    \ from each sample, prepare multiple samples in the time it takes to prepare one,\
    \ and improve reproducibility by using the same starting material. \n\nThe proposed\
    \ project will utilize reversible protein tagging chemistry to create a one-tube\
    \ workflow for the capture, wash, and elution of protein samples for analysis.\
    \  Because this novel reversible protein tagging chemistry is not dependent on\
    \ a catalyst, does not produce byproducts, and is completely biorthogonal, it\
    \ has the potential to work universally with all types of buffer systems, including\
    \ harsh denaturants and detergents commonly used for cell lysis and protein solubilization.\
    \  This proposed work will optimize the utilization of this sample preparation\
    \ technology in the most used buffer systems, model organisms, and will show superior\
    \ yields in the preparation of diagnostic sample types such as blood, urine, and\
    \ cerebrospinal fluid.  Additionally, because our reversible protein tag does\
    \ not cross react with other biomolecules, we will show that we can also use this\
    \ technology to purify other important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites.\
    \  The technology developed in this project will revolutionize how researchers\
    \ prepare samples for analysis, providing them with modular tools that can purify\
    \ any biomolecules they need from the same starting sample, reducing time, improving\
    \ yields, and decreasing batch to batch variability by comparing within the same\
    \ starting sample.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail items moving in and out of buildings.  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  This project will address these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The effort is focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase its effectiveness.  If successful, the project will address critical public health and safety challenges.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset.  No commercially viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One challenge is the detection of liquid or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame – such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device.  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable advanced 3D printing materials to solve challenges in emerging electronic devices, transportation technologies, heating and cooling system for buildings, and in thermal management in manufacturing processes. Overheating is a major challenge as electrical devices continue to grow more compact and energy dense. Heat exchangers manufactured through traditional methods are often expensive and energy intensive to fabricate and suffer from corrosion, limited performance, and high maintenance costs. Traditional mold tools machined from metals are often expensive, require long lead times, and have limited design freedom. To address these challenges, this project will develop a platform of novel high thermal conductivity composite materials that can be used to 3D print parts that enhance electronics cooling and performance while also reducing the product weight and cost, can improve heat exchanger performance while also reducing corrosion, fouling and associated maintenance, and can also be used to 3D print low cost and high-performance molds with low-cost capital and short lead times. The project will result in an advanced materials platform for engineers to create parts with metal-like thermal conductivity, but with the speed, low cost, and ultimate design freedom of printing plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develops 3D printable, plastic composite materials with 500x higher thermal conductivity than standard plastics. The unique materials incorporate continuous wires and fibers in 3D printing filaments to achieve thermal conductivity values not possible in traditionally manufactured composite parts.  The polymer composite shell and wire/fiber core can be tailored to offer high strength, high temperature stability, and even joule heating. These materials are printed directly on commercially available and low-cost Independent Dual Extrusion (IDEX) 3D printers using a modified hardware and software platform. Printing and filament production will be accomplished through the following five objectives: 1) finalize filament formulations for the desired material properties, 2) establish a pilot scale filament manufacturing line to demonstrate production scalability, 3) complete minor 3D printer hardware modifications to accommodate filament printing, 4) develop software to print and optimize parts for desired properties, and 5) print application examples and validate product performance with commercially relevant demonstrations.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve personnel safety from flammable gas leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential facilities. Additionally, the technology contributes to combating climate change by tackling one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.  The technology enables the mitigation of methane and refrigerant leaks that constitutes a significant market opportunity in the oil, gas and HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) markets. The innovation may solve important technical bottlenecks that have prevented widespread adoption of pervasive gas sensing in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As an enabling system, it may be utilized in a variety of other applications area such as the detection of explosives, narcotics, chemical weapons, indoor air quality monitoring, and diagnosis of disease via breath analysis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a gas sensor with an unparalleled combination of size, power, and cost while offering high detection performance. The proposed architecture fabricates high-frequency bulk acoustic resonators directly on the backend of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) integrated circuit chips which permits low-cost, mass-production and improved noise characteristics of the sensors. The direct co-integration also allows the fabrication of a receptor array to obtain responses from multiple target analytes that can be used to classify materials and for real-time calibration against environmental confounders. The objective of this project is the development of a single-chip gas sensor based on co-integrated piezoelectric materials. This effort will consist of the design, fabrication and characterization of integrated resonator arrays onto silicon circuits; integration of the chips with receptor materials, allowing selective adsorption of target gas molecules; and testing to assess the gas sensing performance.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the optics and lenses used in near infrared 3D imaging.  Glass lenses, which have excellent transmittance and thermal properties, are used in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and rangefinders for distances beyond a few tens of meters.  Polymer lenses, which are moldable and lower cost, are typically used in consumer-mobile 3D cameras and emerging automotive LiDAR systems.  The refractive indices of these lenses limit the numerical aperture and require longer-than-desired lens barrels.  The proposed polymeric chalcogenide lenses combine infrared transmittance, index, and thermal properties with the cost and moldability of optical polymers.  The innovation enables the molding of freeform polymer lenses with increased numerical aperture and reduced barrel lengths.  These properties make possible more compact, lighter, and lower cost 3D imagers.  With these advantages, rangefinders can be more easily carried and scan faster and smartphone cameras can have wider viewing angles.  Additionally, LiDAR systems can image more accurately around a vehicle and improve both driver and pedestrian safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance sulfur polymer chemistry and materials processing for the development of a new class of near infrared (NIR) optical components.  Innovative chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering has led to the development of a new class of optical polymers with the potential for imaging applications in the NIR.  As a result of extensive optical and mechanical characterization, including the determination of the optical constants over the full infrared spectrum, measurement of mechanical properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, measurement of thermo-optic coefficients, and determination of stress-optic coefficients, the materials will now be developed and integrated for product applications with innovative optical designs based on material's unique property set.  Freeform optical design concepts will be used which, to date, have not often been used in infrared imaging.  Such designs may lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for infrared imaging applications, further leveraging the advantages of the material's transmission spectrum, incorporating absorption, bulk scattering and surface scattering, and surface scattering contributions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the care and quality of life of colon cancer patients while reducing healthcare costs. The development of a reliable, reversible, and cost-effective means to protect segments of bowel has potential applications to treating a number of common disease conditions such as colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease, and abdominal trauma. There are more than 120,000 temporary ostomies (surgical openings) performed each year in the US, and a majority of these can be eliminated with the development of the funded technology, addressing a $6.4 Billion total market opportunity. This funded device will initially target the over 40,000 individuals who have low bowel resections, the majority for rectal cancer. This represents an initial market size of $200 million in US. The overall impact with full market penetration in just the US rectal resection market is $2.4 billion in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of a novel technology to protect segments of bowel. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer with about 30-40% of cases involving the rectum. Rectal cancer is typically treated with surgical resection. However, anastomotic leaks can occur in up 10-18% of patients after resection, with an associated high mortality due to severe abdominal sepsis. Currently, diverting ostomies are typically placed above the anastomosis to mitigate the severe consequences of an anastomotic leak, but temporary ostomies themselves are highly morbid, have significant risk of mortality, are expensive to the healthcare system, and drastically impact patient’s quality of life. The funded technology is a medical device that provides temporary, minimally invasive protection of bowel during the healing process, avoiding the need for a diverting ostomy. This project will perform design verification testing, end user testing, and large animal validation testing required for human study approval. The goal of this project is to have a fully validated (both benchtop and animal testing completed), clinically ready medical device ready for further development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help patients with cardiorespiratory conditions, including sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia. The project will develop a wearable sensor platform to simultaneously diagnose and monitor conditions. Multiple physiological measurements are collected by a comfortable, wireless sensor patch, resulting in a convenient remote monitoring clinical framework. Interfacing sensor data with an efficient cloud-based provider portal and automated algorithms will enable rapid screening of the 24 million undiagnosed sleep apnea patients in the United States. The proposed innovation will also provide insight into the practical clinical benefits and efficiencies to be gained by bundling multiple comorbid or otherwise related diagnostic pathways into a single workflow, such as reducing time to treatment for comorbid atrial fibrillation. This remote monitoring bundle concept represents the only all-in-one device capable of servicing multiple highly pervasive health challenges in a method unobtrusive and user-friendly for both the patient and the provider - particularly for telemedicine applications made more urgent by the global pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a simple, accurate, cloud-connected wearable patch and collect clinical comparison data to develop automated, low-power algorithms to simultaneously detect sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, and cardiac arrhythmias. The project integrates materials science, mechanical engineering, and signal processing approaches to detect critical physiological signals from the torso, including oxygen saturation and several hemodynamic metrics. The project will also conduct studies that offer early insights into the clinical benefits of bundled workflows across cardiac and sleep medicine specialties.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include the ability to enhance the security and trust of critical infrastructure networks for applications including defense, electric grids, health care, and emerging autonomous systems (i.e., self-driving vehicles and robotics), as many of these systems are mission- and life-critical. The proposed innovation will allow distributed and autonomous systems the ability to make decisions based on highly trusted data sources. More importantly, the innovation addresses an immediate customer need to stop data breaches and prevent unauthorized activity on networks under flaky and uncertain conditions. The proposed innovation will enhance the practical applications of distributed computing fault tolerance and consensus mechanisms by applying them to real-world critical infrastructure networks. Mission-critical systems data are constantly under attack by adversaries at the rate of a billion times per year. For mission-critical systems, compromised data is a serious problem including huge economic losses, potential for mission failures, and in some situations, life-critical consequences. Protecting that data/information is one of the biggest market opportunities of this decade and the proposed work addresses the concerns of information assurance directly.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance an innovation that solves the complex problem of maintaining data integrity for mission-critical data within critical infrastructure networks.  The proposed innovation simplifies the extremely complex science of consensus and fault tolerance in distributed systems by combining flexible deployment of state-of-the-art Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT)consensus algorithms with the proposed novel file system innovation, creating highly useful solution to protect data integrity before it can be compromised under varying network operating conditions including asynchronous network conditions (byzantine and crash fault scenarios, ability to retain all transactions, provide liveness guarantees, maintain local node state integrity, and maintain data ordering and timestamps). The proposed file system solution is designed to be an easy to deploy software platform that keeps data safe, tamper-resistant, verifiable, and trusted over the system’s life cycle.

    \ will enable utilization of waste CO2 from industrial processes, renewable natural\
    \ gas, and renewable electricity as feedstocks to produce a carbon-negative commodity\
    \ chemical such as methanol. The proposed reactor runs on electricity, not fuel,\
    \ creating novel business model opportunities. One example is building and selling\
    \ small-scale, distributed methanol production plants that can utilize intermittent\
    \ renewable electricity sources for their energy source. Large industrial plants,\
    \ such as refineries, that have a source of waste CO2 can utilize the proposed\
    \ technology to make and sell methanol. Moreover, this reactor uses methane, which\
    \ is a plentiful domestic natural resource.  One pressing environmental problem\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the enablement of verifiable and confidential computing through research and development that improves the performance and cost of the underlying cryptographic computations. Digital services play a foundational role in varied sectors including communication, education, banking, and others. Without cryptography these services would be impossible to conduct online in a secure and private manner. However, many new and more powerful cryptographic techniques remain out of reach due to their computationally expensive nature. Reducing the cost of these operations enables not just secure communication, but also verifiable and confidential computation, of rapidly growing interest to both the enterprise and government segments for use cases such as privacy-preserving machine learning. The market for verifiable and confidential computing solutions is expected to grow to over one billion dollars in the next five years.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and develop a high performance cloud-based system for verifiable and confidential computing. Currently many verifiable and confidential computing techniques can not be brought into production due to their computationally expensive nature. This project performs algorithmic research, hardware design, and software development, that will improve the performance and cost of these operations. In particular, this project optimizes cryptographic algorithms to make them more amenable to GPU-based processing, optimize the software implementation of those algorithms to target GPU architectures, devise methods for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and develop a scale-out architecture that dynamically scales capacity as the complexity of uses and number of users grow. With the appropriate design, the project expects to develop a system with over an order of magnitude or more performance than existing designs. Furthermore, by creating a ‘cloud-based’ infrastructure, these resources can be made available to developers around the world, with low latency and low cost. The expected improvements in performance, cost, and access will enable new use cases that have previously been impractical.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    \ Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation\
    \ is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer\
    \ from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional\
    \ electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to\
    \ the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.\
    \  Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects\
    \ during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode\
    \ is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate\
    \ electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.\
    \  The proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic\
    \ surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible\
    \ by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back\

    \ package, and lead array, (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and\
    \ (3) prepare prototypes for subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal\
    \ of the project is to accelerate the medical-grade hardware development effort\
    \ to enable future therapies to treat low-back pain.  Eventual validation after\
    \ this project is completed will be performed in humans by selectively applying\
    \ stimulation and recording if the patient feels therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and networking.  Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers.  The proposed project enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum dot based multiwavelength laser sources.  Multiwavelength lasers with adequate output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion.  The designs and materials platform developed in this project address these challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the widespread adoption of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) by developing and commercializing a decentralized control and optimization platform capable of aggregating and managing millions of independent energy assets connected across the U.S. electric grid. The resulting end-to-end solution will enable private and public project developers, as well as utilities to quickly commission and cost effectively operate DER systems composed of solar arrays, batteries, generators, fuel cells and many other kinds of energy assets in residential, commercial, and industrial sites with complete confidence on the reliability, seamless grid integration, and economic performance of the systems. By making it that much easier and cheaper to own, integrate, and operate clean energy equipment, the resulting solution will transform the energy industry from the ground up, using DERs as the pillars of a new clean, resilient, and equitable grid.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will drastically simplify the way distributed energy resources (DER) systems are commissioned, aggregated, and operated. Such deployments are complex due to an endemic lack of standardization, the sheer number of key variables to control and optimize, and the lack of modularity in conventional approaches. Properly coordinating them as they continue to rapidly increase in number on the grid requires a decentralized approach that puts the decision-making at the DER level.  The project consists of two stages: (1) A development phase, where the algorithms will be integrated into a best-in-class solution, which will include all the necessary end-user facing tools, cloud infrastructure, and edge devices to enable full automation of deployments and satisfy technical requirements of customers in the mainstream market; and (2) a demonstration phase, where the resulting solution will be used at two different sites and benchmarked against critical use cases to validate its benefits and leverage the results to scale up market penetration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a sensor system for cell-based manufacturing of such products as biologic therapies, food ingredients, and bio-based materials. These sensors will overcome current limitations for tracking critical cell growth data, which requires manual sampling with slow turnaround times.  This system will enable better predictive growth models for improved production process development and will lead to better decision-making on cell type and culture conditions to produce biologic material. Better performance at this stage leads to potentially significant savings during the manufacturing lifetime of the drug.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a wireless sensor system to address the need of continuously monitoring viable cell density during biomanufacturing. Many industries use cells for production, but the initial focus is upstream development of cell therapies and biologics. Central to this development is tracking the growth of cells in a variety of small-scale, single-use bioreactors to determine key event points for feed and harvest. Current methods rely on infrequent sampling and off-line counting due to the volume required, risk of contamination, and cost. The central research objective is to develop methods for standardized sensor and reader fabrication and quality testing for calibration studies in commercially-relevant environments and systems.  The proposed project will develop: 1) sensor stickers that are applied to the exterior of culture vessels, 2) readers that interrogate the sensor, and 3) algorithms to convert the sensor signal to cell count and push notifications to operators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve care for pulmonary conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This disease affects 30 million Americans, kills more than 150,000 a year and is the third leading cause of U.S. deaths. COPD costs Americans nearly $72 billion a year, half of which is spent on ER visits and hospital stays resulting from respiratory crises. Hospitalized COPD patients have reduced quality of life, more rapid lung disease progression, and a 50% increase in mortality in the subsequent two years. Currently, ongoing monitoring of COPD lung deterioration relies largely on patient-reported symptoms and inadequate tools (65-70% accurate). As a result, half of COPD deterioration remains undetected. The proposed technology facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of COPD attacks by continuous remote tracking of lung function, thereby preventing unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. This device improves care for long-term conditions like COPD or asthma, but also those with relatively quick onset, such as COVID-19.

    The proposed project advances translation of a device using acoustic resonance to measure lung air volume. The project develops an expanded data set for analysis and deployment at scale. The project further incorporates advanced classification models into the analysis workflow to track and predict deteriorating lung function in a cloud-computing environment. The project will also develop a version to run on a patient's mobile device to enable real-time feedback.

    \ This project focuses on the optimization of musical structures to support effective\

    \ as a credible pedagogical tool. Specifically, this project offers music as a\
    \ learning medium that can be used beyond rote memorization and instead teach\
    \ mathematical skills, processes, and procedures in an engaging manner that makes\
    \ math accessible to all learners. Mathematical fluency is a critical skill in\
    \ a society that continues to become more technological; it also creates broader\
    \ career opportunities for students and undergirds the U.S.'s national competitiveness.\
    \ \n\n\nThe proposed research features two innovations: 1) optimization of learning-based\
    \ musical forms based on distinct mathematical information types; and 2) creation\
    \ of a non-linear, dynamic platform to deliver the content. Using computational\
    \ musicology techniques as well as experimental studies, the first innovation\
    \ involves creation of mathematically accurate music videos based on unique creative\
    \ and structural parameters that are determined by the type of mathematical information\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as expanded polystyrene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will be to address the customized needs of automotive applications with tailored high performance-low cost carbon fiber (HP-LCCF) products that are not currently commercially available. The broader impact of HP-LCCF technology is to enable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies to help mitigate the climate change linked emissions caused by fossil fuel powered vehicles.  Volume projections of HP-LCCF for this application are expected to ramp up significantly over the ten years.  After successful entry into the automotive market, the focus will be expanded to address needs in the wind energy market and with a tailored HP-LCCF product to enable longer blades for larger and more efficient wind turbines.  This technology will help spur global adoption of clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a process where heavy tow carbon fiber is subdivided using an electromechanical splitting process that can maintain an acceptable range of regular tow carbon fiber linear densities.  Subsequent tailoring trials will verify the capability to achieve and maintain the linear density targets provided by the automotive industry partners who will, in turn, perform downstream manufacturability trials.  Subdividing the heavy tows enables a seamless commercial entry into customers' downstream composite manufacturing processes without an inherent, potentially fatal heavy tow defect.  Such defects are typically non-uniform intra-band tension caused by the transverse catenary forces across the tow band.  Achieving high band linear density and variable intra-band tension are significant barriers for the commercial adoption of heavy tow high performance, low cost carbon fibers (HP-LCCF).  The process developed here may eliminate such issues and achieve commercially relevant HP-LCCF.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of an analytical instrument to detect protein changes across all stages of protein production.  The production of highly-engineered therapeutic proteins has outpaced the development of analytical assays to guarantee effectiveness, purity, and shelf life of the drug.  A key control parameter during manufacturing is protein conformation; currently, this is difficult to monitor with commercially available technology. The goal of this project is to provide manufacturers with a new generation of analytical technology that allows them to identify variations between batches. This technology also provides information about product stability so manufacturers can guarantee a longer shelf life for their products, regardless of storage conditions. It is anticipated that this instrument will increase efficacy at all stages, from discovery through scaled-up production and formulation to pre-release certification.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to improve biotherapeutic drug production through the commercialization of analytical technology that provides a new metric for the rapid QC/QA assessment of the conformation of proteins. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography - a time-consuming technique that requires high quality crystals and a high-energy physics facility to produce coherent x-rays. The proposed highly sensitive bench-top ion mobility spectrometer detects small variations in the cross-sectional area of a protein and detects small conformational changes. This provides a capability to determine protein stability during discovery when only microgram quantities of recombinantly expressed proteins are available. This process also indicates if a protein refolded after it was subjected to a pH change during purification, and thus it may be used to identify challenges to long-term shelf life. This instrument will be used to demonstrate that for the first time, ion mobility will produce highly-reproducible and biologically relevant measurements of the quality of biomanufactured proteins.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a tool to measure joint mobility. There are a large number of orthopedic injuries and a significant need to quantitatively assess and treat these injuries.  An earlier attempt to address this market using a large, expensive, and cumbersome to use device developed in the 1980's is no longer on the market.  Since that time, technology has significantly evolved, and the device under development will demonstrate that it can provide a better, smaller, cheaper solution with greater orthopedic utility.  This device will be valuable to both educational and clinical venues. There are over 820 educational programs in medicine, chiropractic, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training.  A device to provide feedback will support joint mobility professionals; the clinical market totals over 1.1 M professionals with projected growth of 14-34% over the next decade.  These clinicians need tools to quantify techniques to enhance the practice of orthopedics. This device will help to transform the ability to collect data on joint measurement procedures to provide literature on examination and treatment efficacy and begin to develop "best practice" protocols.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an orthopedic device to precisely quantify joint mobility.  The proposed device is able to quantify joint laxity to contribute to the clinical decision-making regarding injury management to consistently render therapeutic treatments, improving quality of care.  The proposed technology is a design for a simple, portable, and economical device used between the hands of the clinician and the joint of the patient to measure the linear displacement of the joint's bones.  Aligning the device's axis with the indicated joint results in translation of the device's distal component on the stabilized proximal segment. A display of the linear translation appears immediately.  The device represents a "first-to-market" technology for arthrokinematic/linear assessment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by developing novel air pollution analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others.

    The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies ultimately in saving lives. This project proposes a Machine Learning-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) firearms detection system for law enforcement. Implementation of this technology would significantly reduce the cognitive burden of police officers in dangerous situations, allowing for more informed decisions. Additionally, there are benefits to the warfighter and security professionals to improve their capabilities in keeping the nation and public safe. Successful implementation and commercialization of a firearms detection system will grant capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data to find insights previously unknown, and to provide a data-driven approach towards real-time reactions around firearms and firearm usage.

    The proposed project aims to research and develop a Machine Learning-enabled, integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm activity, such as discharges and unholsters. The challenges are two-fold: 1) to develop and iterate based on pilot user feedback regarding the hardware and software portions of the system; and 2) to employ machine learning on a unique dataset for insights on firearms knowledge and handling. The proposed research and development plan calls for pilots with several law enforcement agencies, hardware and software iterations based on user feedback, and research into a real-life dataset collected by police officers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new method to distribute “last mile” fiber optic communication lines. Existing fiber installation methods like trenching require extensive approvals and are labor-intensive, disruptive, and cost-prohibitive, especially in underserved or remote areas. “Last mile” fiber is the most expensive part of any installation with a market valued at over $50 billion. This solution enables a quick, low-cost deployment of optical fiber directly onto pavement without cutting into the surface, effectively turning a barrier into a pathway. This new method will enable ubiquitous fiber optic connectivity and will expand the reach of fiber optic networks through the “last mile”. By lowering fiber deployment costs and improving efficiency, this technology will accelerate the rollout of 5G, enable smart city growth, and deliver broadband access to rural areas. This solution extends the benefits of fast communications to previously inaccessible locations, connecting businesses, homes, hospitals, and schools,  providing access to information, knowledge, and opportunity for everyone.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to validate a new fiber installation method leveraging existing road networks. Using pavement as the base, low-profile fiber cables are bonded to the surface and protected against traffic and weather by layers of durable coatings. Fiber links can be installed quickly on-demand with an installation machine that requires no digging and minimal disruption. The research objectives of this project are to build and test three prototype machines in the field and to iterate on design.  The research includes using the machines to install fiber, test pavement transitions, and compare costs and speed against other installation techniques. The anticipated technical results will expand understanding of machine utility, improve the user interface, verify the suitability, and validate economics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

    The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance new real-time tracking technologies that increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of container shipping across the world.  The container shipping industry underpins the modern supply chain and represents a $1.5 B market.  The proposed solution introduces 5G internet-of-things to tracking in worldwide shipping by demonstrating performance in the dirty, complex, and highly-cluttered environments of repair facilities and terminals crowded with container stacks.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be the continued exploration of backscattered mm-wave radio frequency identification (RFIDs)   for localization and communication.  In addition, although hardware and standards used for standard ultra-high frequency RFID-based localization systems have benefited from decades of improvements, methods appropriate for higher-frequency methods are virtually unexplored and feature radically different challenges. This effort will advance the tag and reader hardware and software, followed by optimization of the standard for the concurrent localization and communications with mm-wave backscatter tags. Finally, the project will conduct verification and validation of the mm-RFID system's mechanical and functional performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However, operating in today’s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application.  This project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively.  The technology represents a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete colonoscopies.  The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective, manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure realm.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to lower costs for injection molding, a common method of manufacturing plastic goods. Unfortunately, injection molding can be a lengthy and wasteful process because molds are designed, machined from metal, and then shipped to an injection molder. The proposed project will develop new tooling for low-volume injection molding applications at strengths and resolutions comparable with machined aluminum at a fraction of the current cost and lead time, providing extra resilience to the supply chain.  This will be used for applications in industries across automotive, aerospace, consumer product goods, and medical devices.

    This Phase II SBIR will apply advancements in 3D printing of fiber-reinforced photopolymers to the injection molding application.  This project will apply advancements in fiber-filled photopolymers (such as ceramic and polymer particle reinforced resins) in combination with magnetically aligned structures to injection mold tools. Tooling inserts will be tested across the most common and challenging injection molding plastics.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is translation of a novel, non-invasive monitor for fetal health during labor and delivery that will improve care and reduce cost. Currently, clinicians rely on monitor technologies that are subjective, unreliable and have high false positive rates for detecting the fetus at risk of hypoxia (fetal distress), resulting in high rates of medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries. When medically unnecessary, intervention by cesarean delivery incurs avoidable healthcare cost, unwarranted maternal risk and adverse consequences for newborns. Further, misdiagnosis of fetal health with current technologies results in costly medical negligence litigation. Fetal pulse oximetry would be applicable to over 3 million births per year in the United States alone.  This project will advance a new technology to measure oxygen in the fetus's pulse, creating a new method to ensure health of mother and child during delivery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a new safe, non-invasive, reflectance-based optical method for transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry. This method detects the fetal signal at the surface of the maternal abdomen and extracts it from the combined maternal-fetal signal. This project will conduct verification and validation tests to integrate signal processing, biophotonics, and pulse oximetry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in the negative effects of laparoscopies, procedures to enter the abdomen through a small incision.  Over 15 million laparoscopies are performed worldwide each year, particularly gynecologists, who represent roughly half the surgeons performing these procedures in the U.S. The proposed procedure does not require surgeons to alter their surgical techniques and requires minimal training. It uses equipment already in the hospital. The benefits will include better surgical outcomes, decreased patient post-op pain, and increased surgeon and patient satisfaction.  Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp and less invasively than perforating towel clips.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may be a fundamental shift in academic and life outcomes for students, especially those from low-income and vulnerable populations, by building metacognition and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. This project will advance the company's technology that builds critical SEL and metacognition skills in a way that is student-led and integrated with academic content and routines.  The effort expands teacher capacity in a measurable way. The project will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the company’s proprietary data of student reflections and teacher feedback, will train Machine Learning (ML) driven predictive algorithms to measure reflection quality and will build a learning strategies recommendation engine. This innovation will allow teachers and students to expand their toolkits of effective pedagogically-sound learning strategies. The deeper application of the innovation unlocks commercialization potential coupled with transformational outcomes for student learning.


    The Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support the feasibility and commercialization of applying NLP techniques and ML algorithms based on the company’s proprietary data to “read” student reflections, rate them on a quality rubric, and help teachers provide feedback. Stage I of this project will be a lower effort, fast value objective to apply data science and analytics to roll-up real-time quality assessments to measure growth at the student.  The project will provide reports on the reflection quality to school administrators and feedback tips to teachers based on student reflection quality and classroom context. Stage II would be a higher effort.  One objective will be to build a Strategy Recommendation Engine driven by NLP and ML techniques and based on the latest research in pedagogy and learning sciences. This technology will analyze past reflections to identify which learning strategies a student has tried, then provide teachers with suggestions on pedagogy-driven strategies they can be recommended to improve the students' learning.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a high-resolution digital fingertip: a soft, easy-to-use, and compact sensor that will provide human-like tactile sensing. Such a sensor can be used to automate assembly tasks in next-generation factories, enable smart objects to understand their tactile environment, and equip scientists with a finger-like sensor for studying human touch. Industries have been transformed by the digitization of our auditory and visual worlds. A high-resolution digital fingertip will provide the mechanism for digitizing the tactile world, leading to applications and technological developments that will affect many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a soft, compact, and high-resolution tactile sensor based on elastomeric imaging technology. To achieve the desired form factor while maintaining a large sensing area, this project will develop novel optical and illumination configurations more compact than designs using conventional optics. These developments will demonstrate micro-scale imaging by a compact device and allow for modularity to expand the sensing area. This effort will lead to new insight into illumination design for shading-based 3D measurement, as well as optimizations to allow for real-time tactile information. The system will be coupled with a software development kit that provides real-time tactile information, including contact locations, force, and shape. The software development kit will make the system accessible to researchers and engineers from other disciplines, essential for broad adoption.  The high-resolution digital fingertip, together with the software development kit, will enable new applications benefiting from tactile information.

    \ clear understanding of the impacts of climate change on their business so as\
    \ to inform strategic planning and risk management strategies. Those in the risk\

    \ acute awareness of the financial impacts climate change now has on their bottom\
    \ line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate the reinsurance industry as an\
    \ entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer industry. Subsequently,\
    \ the company will utilize the platform to address problems in agricultural investment,\
    \ real estate investment, and energy planning - all sectors that will be adversely\
    \ impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined ways. The adaptation in\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology that will improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in combatting the U.S. illegal drug epidemic, which contributed to over 67,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. An affordable, effective field drug test system, superior to conventional color test kits and Raman-based test systems, would address this challenge, particularly because the widely used color test kits are outdated, hazardous, and susceptible to a high false positive rate. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit data analysis that will help LE reduce the supply of dangerous drugs from the communities they serve. This innovation has the potential to expand into other markets, including medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a novel system for on-site presumptive drug testing and collection of drug intelligence for LE. Conventional color tests are inaccurate and highly flawed, often resulting in failure to accurately detect common drugs and novel drug analogues as they are introduced into the illegal substance market. Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    \ This project plans to implement quantum-safe security solutions that will require\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from improved financial resilience of hundreds of thousands of water-dependent businesses and municipalities currently threatened by hydrologic volatility and severely strained ecosystems. This SBIR research will enable the seamless integration of scientific and financial modeling for the water economy. The innovation lowers the costs and improves the performance of two climate risk mitigation investments: 1) Green Infrastructure (projects that emulate or protect nature in order to ensure clean water supply for commercial and public use); and 2) weather insurance contracts, which provide businesses and utilities with financial relief from droughts and floods that hamper their operations. With 50% of the global population projected to face water scarcity by 2050 (according to the UN), and $10B in economic value destroyed annually by floods, droughts, freezes in the US, these new approaches to risk mitigation are crucial to reducing water demand stresses through a free-market approach to water resource conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to eliminate technical barriers currently hindering seamless data and model integration for hydrology and finance. The Phase I project validated technical feasibility by demonstrating the utility of a semantic web technology to provide end-to-end modeling solutions for quantifying hydro-financial risk. Phase I established that the technology 1) greatly improves the interoperability between massive heterogeneous data sets and models for quantifying hydrologic-financial risk, and 2) enables data and models to be linked through a tamper-proof distributed network. The Phase II project builds on the technological foundation to deploy a production environment for running a suite of models encompassing ecosystem services, hydrology, and actuarial sciences. The project builds foundations for AI-enabled decision support tools. If successful, this research will enable significant reductions in the time and costs associated with modeling the financial value of investment in natural water infrastructure, generating comparisons between a wide range of water projects and financial structures seamlessly and without compromising scientific rigor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from development of a technology to automatically detect controversy and disinformation, providing a means for financial institutions to reduce risk exposure. Controversies and disinformation have received public attention and political concern recently. Application of the technology in the finance industry is part of a growing trend toward "alternative data" products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning, saving analyst time and enabling faster reactions to news stories and social media. Demonstrating the innovation in a quantifiable application, such as finance, is expected to lead to more far-reaching societal impact by enabling users to critically and quantitatively evaluate the often-overwhelming stream of online content.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of novel algorithms that automatically detect controversy in social media, news, and other outlets. The proposed project will apply a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data, using methods such as language models and machine learning. Additionally, this project will: 1) build core capabilities based on existing controversy detection technology; and 2) construct novel algorithms with broad applicability.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the development of a scalable, universal quantum computing platform. The range of applications are broad and will expand in parallel with the development of new quantum algorithms, with initial applications including molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, currently limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, quantum computing must be significantly scaled. The proposed system will develop a new method to trap and control individual atoms for scaling of quantum computers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technology for parallel, high-fidelity single- and multi-qubit gates in neutral atom quantum computers. The technology will enable neutral atoms as a platform for scalable quantum computing technology with fault-tolerant capabilities.  The proposed project includes: 1) development of systems to control atomic qubits in parallel; 2) a methodology to enact high-fidelity gates; and 3) development of necessary infrastructure for a cloud-accessed quantum computer.  With a previously unrealized degree of coherent control to atomic systems, the proposed system will serve as an entirely novel tool to study many-body physics, enabling new quantum simulations of new phases of matter or high-energy physics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide new infomration on cognitive health. The support includes 60 M people who identify as athletes, 3 M annually suffering traumatic brain injuries, and the 40 M more looking to measure brain health. Current healthcare assessments are available at specialized facilities with trained professionals and detect only significant changes to cognition. In contrast, this project develops an affordable, reliable way to measure brain health and to monitor changes after treatment, training, and rehabilitation. This project leverages expertise in human performance, cognitive neuroscience, computer science and virtual reality simulation. Furthermore, it offers athletes a way to assess cognitive abilities such as focus, decision making and multitasking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the technical aspects of training, measuring, analyzing and reporting how people perform athletic and cognitive tasks in unison. These domains of research and technical knowledge come together to form a unique cognition platform that accounts for both physical and cognitive behavior. The platform's measurement instruments reflect cutting-edge research on (1) human perception, specifically in fast-paced and dynamic environments; and (2) the interplay of perception and action in a virtual reality environment. The analytics engine captures and processes thousands of data points per minute describing object locations in simulated space; users' hands, body and head behavior; and cognitive performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a high-performance, economic, and sustainable carbon fiber material and associated processing technology for consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and mass market automobiles. In current processes, roughly 30% of carbon fiber is typically scrapped during manufacturing. By 2024, an estimated 50,000 metric tons of virgin carbon fiber will be scrapped and disposed in landfills. The proposed technology will extract value from scrapped fiber and prevent disposal, offering up to 25% cost reduction compared with carbon fiber products commercially available today. This technology creates higher usage and new opportunities for this advanced material.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-performance composite that utilizes low-cost and sustainable milled carbon fiber.  An industrial roll-to-roll production process will be used to compound virgin carbon fiber with milled fiber.  These reclaimed fibers are oriented in the Z-axis using a proprietary technology adapted from an industrial process originally developed to make thermoset products.  The proposed project will develop a market-ready thermoplastic product with dense Z-axis reinforcement while retaining key in-plane properties. This new thermoplastic product will be targeted towards translation to high-volume consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and automotive applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the reliability of electric power generation.  Steady, uninterrupted service of power plants is often taken for granted in the economy, national security, and private use. The proposed product improves electric-power reliability by detecting a source of potential catastrophic failure of generator overload or startup, where a single event can cause damage of $10 million in repair costs and revenue losses from operational downtime. The innovation will help mitigate specific risks in the electric-power infrastructure.

    The proposed project aims to develop a portable magnetic-field monitoring device measuring Tesla-strength magnetic fields at a 100 ppm-level or better, with measurement times of 1 ms or less, and over a temperature range from 10 °C to 100 °C through spectroscopic techniques. The proposed atomic probe will naturally be resilient against electromagnetic interference.  The project addresses a need for sensors capable of monitoring the amplitude and direction of magnetic fields in large generators to avoid generator over-fluxing, which can lead to catastrophic failure and downtimes. The project will develop the probe head and control unit, and will further conduct verification and validation tests of the prototype.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help semiconductor chipmakers overcome\

    \ processes.  CMP processes enable cutting-edge manufacturing; currently chipmakers\
    \ often face scaling difficulties as the size of the smallest features continues\

    \ and increasing process throughput.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research\
    \ (SBIR) Phase II project will improve CMP processes with innovative polishing\
    \ pads. Conventional polishing pads have randomly distributed micropores inside\
    \ of the pads and typically generate around 1% real contact area between the pad\
    \ asperities and wafer during polishing. This leads to unwanted polishing results,\
    \ such as dishing/erosion and scratch defects on chip patterns due to the stress\
    \ concentration on asperities. Conventional pads require a pad conditioning process\
    \ to regenerate the asperities on the pad surface. The polishing processes developed\
    \ under this project use microfabrication technologies to control micro-features\
    \ on the pad surface. Therefore, the contact area between the pad and wafer is\
    \ customizable and controllable up to 30%. This will improve the polishing performance\
    \ precision and consistency, leading to fewer defects. As the micro-features on\
    \ the soft sub-pad are independent, the conformity of the pad increases and the\
    \ pressure on the wafer is evenly distributed across the wafer surface. This will\
    \ significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity,\
    \ and reduce the pad wear.  As a result, the pad conditioning process can be minimized\
    \ or even eliminated from the CMP process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory\

    \ platform's competitive advantages are the following: 1) it can operate at temperatures\
    \ 50% higher (degrees C) than current materials 2) it is castable, instead of\
    \ requiring extrusion molding or machining and 3) it is cost competitive with\
    \ current low-temperature neutron shielding materials.  The primary objective\
    \ is to develop a reproducible, full-scale manufacturing process for this new\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to dramatically improve the corrosion protection of metal assets vital to the energy and transportation industries.  Corrosion contributes to the loss of structural integrity of metal structures, which poses a risk to human safety and the surrounding environment. Metal corrosion costs an estimated $2.5 T globally, with US costs representing roughly 25%.  Durable, anticorrosive, highly water-repellent coatings using special materials can potentially double the lifetime of coatings on oil platforms and ships in a way that protects the environment. This extends maintenance cycles and reduces asset lifetime maintenance costs up to 50%. The high performance will also reduce the number of coating layers, reducing labor costs up to 25% per maintenance cycle.  This technology will improve structural safety, reduce maintenance frequency, lengthen the operating lifetimes, improve environmental characteristics, and reduce the costs of operating and maintaining metal assets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project further translates coatings of superhydrophobic smart particles for high-performance anticorrosion paints.  These superhydrophobic particles offer new on-demand release of corrosion inhibitors (active corrosion protection) and superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) into one multi-functional material, unlike current state of practice. The platform nature of the technology enables inclusion of numerous types of corrosion inhibitors to safeguard delicate marine environments. Smart particles can then be incorporated into many existing coating systems to deliver a unique combination of durable, anticorrosive, and highly water-repellent coatings. This project will optimize production processes and conduct verification and validation tests.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
