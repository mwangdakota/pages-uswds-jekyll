    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to significantly reduce the number of injuries or deaths suffered by pavement marking workers on public streets and roads, while increasing the efficiency and lowering costs by using an operator-driven, truck-mounted, mobile robotic pavement marking system. Robotic painting allows workers to remain in the safety of the truck cab, protecting them from traffic.  Increased efficiency will help to minimize work zone congestion and duration, while reduced costs will enable safer and more productive streetscapes for the general public. Studies have repeatedly confirmed that streetscapes with a high density of transverse marking features such as shared center turning lanes, dedicated bike lanes with separation buffer zones, and pedestrian-friendly crosswalks result in measurable public health benefits, enhanced quality of life, increased commercial activity, and, counterintuitively, more efficient traffic flow with fewer collisions. The project will also better enable precise placement of new markings and precise overpainting of worn or eroded markings, both important factors for connected and autonomous vehicles. An earlier phase of the project has already resulted in enhancements to camera calibration techniques for machine vision.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to build on a successful Phase I effort to enable a commercially-viable robotic road painting system that addresses the need to protect the lives of human workers engaged in the dangerous task of stenciling roadway markings such as turn arrows or bike symbols. The project may also improve the accuracy and ease of application of markings needed to support autonomous vehicle-ready roadways. The research will apply advanced software, machine vision, an augmented-reality user interface, and proprietary robotic trajectory planning technologies to support ultraprecision painting in the real-world environment while keeping human workers safe in the cab of the operator-driven truck upon which the robot is mounted. The solution will enable robots to paint previously unmarked pavement and to repaint existing marks. The combined hardware and software solution will be capable of recording all planned and completed markings in a cloud-hosted database—an innovation that will streamline the processes.  The technology will also form a cloud-based standard for mapping and recording universal road markings and support the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate safely. While much of the research can initially be performed in simulation, significant real-world testing and validation will be required as well.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to allow America’s grape industry to reduce crop losses due to spring frost, estimated at over $1 billion per year, as well as related job losses – more than 11,000 individuals in the State of Washington alone.  The encapsulating bud break delay technology and predictive analytics support farmers with decision making tools ahead of impending frost events during bud break season.  Such tools may enable rural communities to achieve economic stability by decreasing yield losses and lowering production costs.  The technology fills gaps in knowledge needed to make informed decisions on individual farms, resulting in better management decisions in the face of increasing complexities of spring freeze threats. Additionally, use of the encapsulation technology may reduce carbon emissions and water usage from current fossil fuel-intensive conventional frost mitigation measures such as burners, wind machines and sprinklers.

    The proposed encapsulating bud break delay technology involves two main advances. First, a gel encapsulation spray biologically delays the process of bud break consistently up to 14 days and increases cold resistance up to 6 degrees Celsius. Second, to guide growers in delivering this product, a Decision Support System (DSS) aids grape growers in deciding when it is necessary to mitigate pending frost conditions. The Phase II project focuses on increasing the predictive accuracy of the DSS and scaling the system. Specifically, the team will focus on: a) optimizing the formulation and testing in the lab, b) field-testing and data collection at five sites, c) enhancing DSS capabilities with additional data and analysis, d) scaling up for large-scale manufacture and application, and e) gathering data for regulatory approvals. This gel encapsulation solution for frost protection of vineyards may find future applications in other fruits crops such as apples and stones fruits that are even more susceptible to spring frost damage than grapes.

- abstractText: "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all\
    \ carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for\
    \ process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel.\
    \ Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel\
    \ creates energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are\
    \ threatened, it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.\n\
    The impact of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source\
    \ of high temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce\
    \ CO2 emissions, improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify\
    \ America?s energy supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will\
    \ offset 29,900 gallons of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven\
    \ envisions doing thousands of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across\
    \ the globe. One day IMA technology may even enable rural areas and developing\
    \ nations to leapfrog natural gas distribution infrastructure in the same way\
    \ that cellphones have leapfrogged landlines. This project is an opportunity for\
    \ the United States to take a leadership role in technology to enable these societal\
    \ changes.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address\
    \ a key barrier to solar thermal deployment in the industrial sector: lack of\
    \ an effective interface to connect high temperature solar thermal system with\
    \ legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces are limited to low temperatures\
    \ (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes that are prone to failure.\
    \ They suffer from poor reliability and create severe maintenance headaches, rendering\
    \ them unusable in the industrial sector.  These systems also typically require\
    \ the host facility to be take offline during installation ? an costly sacrifice\
    \ in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are particularly problematic,\
    \ as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures condensate return systems\
    \ that rarely drop below 100?C.  \nSkyven?s system-level innovations solve these\
    \ challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal collectors a practical\
    \ and financially-attractive option for industries such as food processing.  Phase\
    \ II research will implement two innovations in particular: (1) solar steam injection\
    \ into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless control with automated\
    \ optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe stagnation/overheat\
    \ protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature operation\
    \ up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a real-world\
    \ industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering\
    \ concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited\
    \ test time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in\
    \ the space of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems\
    \ can be integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing,\
    \ without require rework of the existing control systems.\n\nThis award reflects\

    \ wide coverage of combination nozzles in one system. In the Phase I work, fire-suppression\
    \ studies showed that such water stream patterns increase suppression rates by\
    \ three times for vegetation fires while using less than half the water. In the\
    \ proposed Phase II work, the nozzles will be optimized for structural fires.\
    \ Additionally, as part of the Phase II work, an adjustable smooth-bore nozzle\
    \ will be developed. These adjustable nozzles will further increase the suppression\
    \ efficiency and allow the firefighters to adapt to different fire scenarios.\

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of renewable electricity.  Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by 2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account for as much as 85% of total costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at scale.

    This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the productivity, environmental sustainability, and profitability of soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is a major driver of rainforest deforestation, motivating improved yields for environmental sustainability.  In addition, current commercial soybean varieties are highly susceptible to Asian soybean rust, an aggressive fungal disease that is especially severe in tropical and subtropical climates and can decimate soybean yield. This disease is controlled by chemical fungicides that are expensive, pose risks to the environment and human health, and are becoming less effective as the pathogen develops tolerance to over-used chemicals. This project will enable the development of soybean varieties immune to this disease. This will reduce the need for fungicide use in soybean cultivation, reduce yield loss caused by the pathogen, and improve grower profitability. In addition, this technology can be expanded to other crops.

    The proposed project will result in the identification of new plant disease resistance traits with activity against the pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust. The typical plant species has hundreds of immune receptor genes which surveil for the presence of invading pathogens. Plant breeders routinely use plant immune receptor genes to develop new disease-resistant crop varieties. However, traditional methods to identify and translate these traits are time-consuming. The proposed work utilizes a rapid gene discovery platform to accelerate identification of new disease resistance traits. This project will identify and test several resistance traits. The identification and cloning of these resistance gene sequences will allow them to be quickly moved into elite soybean varieties, resulting in significant time and labor savings relative to traditional breeding. These traits can be stacked together to confer durable resistance against a broad range of Asian soybean rust strains.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

- abstractText: "Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) offers tremendous benefit for rapid\
    \ prototyping, mass customization, and low cost fabrication. This creates an untapped\
    \ opportunity to develop the technology further to support low volume industrial\
    \ manufacturing for price sensitive and emerging markets. The ability to source\
    \ locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into\
    \ a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer\
    \ and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping.\
    \ The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial\
    \ objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale\
    \ products represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are\
    \ ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet\
    \ extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on\
    \ extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the\
    \ ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise\
    \ in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet\
    \ 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs\
    \ by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and\
    \ feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics. \n\n\nre:3D intends to leverage\
    \ Phase I research conducted on material requirements for polyethylene terephthalate\
    \ (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available reclaimed plastics worldwide,\
    \ to further optimize the pellet printer to be able to accept reclaimed flake\
    \ as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include developing the ability\
    \ to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean and switch between\
    \ materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake\
    \ into the platform will also be developed with the requisite controls. Once complete,\
    \ the company will pilot the solution in Texas through IC2 as well as in Puerto\
    \ Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain, in conjunction with\
    \ waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science & Research Trust.\
    \ The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2 will be incorporated\
    \ into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan Technological University's\
    \ (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior\
    \ work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source\
    \ firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively\
    \ tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used\
    \ for casting, mold production and load bearing applications. Once the prototype\
    \ design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU and field-tested,\
    \ all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort to scale the\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop a medical device for valve replacement treatment of chronic insufficiency of the veins (CVI). Currently, no definitive treatment option exists to address the underlying cause of the disease, valvular reflux, which leaves millions of patients with chronic venous ulcers, skin thickening, and pain for years to decades. When brought to market, the proposed novel prosthetic valve and delivery system will provide a viable curative therapy superior to current treatment options and mitigating complications associated with existing valve prostheses, such as thrombosis and valve incompetence. The proposed product will curtail substantial health care expenditures associated with CVI, such as wound care, hospitalizations for infections, and associated secondary procedures. Because implantation of this valve does not require the complex or invasive surgical interventions of existing technologies, its use also will avoid expenses associated with open surgical procedures and rehabilitative care. The commercialization of this innovation is expected to benefit CVI patients, while significantly reducing costs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel, reliable, and marketable prosthetic valve and delivery system for the treatment of incompetent veins. In Phase I, a design was created for a device that exceeded laboratory and animal benchmarks. Phase II proposed development improves the design for broader deployment by demonstrating the the valve's ability to minimize thrombosis as well as the capability to be produced at scale. Phase II objectives are to:  1) Develop and produce the next generation valve for in vitro and animal testing; 2) Compare safety of valve designs in an in vitro study; 3) Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the leading design in a chronic animal study; 4) Complete biocompatibility testing on the design to ensure it is appropriate for human testing; and 5) Establish manufacturability of the device. These steps will provide the foundation for future clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in humans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate development of immunotherapeutics and make them broadly available and affordable to patients in need. Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact.  Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value).

    The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seek to improve the quality of life for manufacturing workers, help U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improve the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells may reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The developed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants perform the low-level tedious tasks. Moreover, this technology enables the human operator to guide the team operation. This ability will improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. performing composite fabrication. Most of these companies face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn. These challenges lead to longer delivery times. This project may  enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, the technology may enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing the reliance on human labor and easily scaling production capacity with the change in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robotic sanding solution for high-mix applications by providing safety under uncertainty during robotic sanding and reducing cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient trajectories by the robot. This award will make computational advances to enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description.  The project will also enable the computational algorithms to account for the uncertainties present in the environment, making robots useful for sanding operations in high-mix applications. A robotic sanding cell for handling large parts in high-mix applications will be developed by selecting the appropriate sensors and tools. Algorithms will be developed for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell while the workpiece is secured with a cost-effective, general-purpose, low-cost fixture. Algorithms will be developed to determine the minimum number of setups needed for sanding large parts in the robotic cell and to generate robot trajectories to produce tool motion patterns that ensure efficient and safe sanding operation.

    \ Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will be to supply nitrogen sensors\

    \ $600 M per year in electric energy for the U.S. municipal wastewater treatment\
    \ industry. Municipal wastewater treatment processes are based on energy-intensive\

    \ plant is an average energy savings of $200 k per year, with less than 6 months\
    \ payback, and lower operating costs while reducing/preventing out-of-control\
    \ effluent events.  Competing technologies for real-time nitrogen sensors are\

    \ addresses strong IR attenuation in water with the first industrial-scale sensor\
    \ application based on a fiber-optic evanescent wave technique, guiding mid-IR\
    \ radiation from a tunable quantum-cascade laser through an IR waveguide rather\

    \ have a wide range of sensitivity, from 0.1 ppm to 250 ppm, and can be used for\
    \ other important chemical species with fingerprints in the mid-IR spectral range,\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the resiliency of the supply chain by implementing flexible robotic systems for materials handling.  The robotic systems that are controlled by artificial intelligence. E-commerce sales are increasing 20% year over year. During the COVID-19 pandemic additional retail volume shifted online and many customers became accustomed to sourcing essentials using e-commerce. This shift has put a greater burden on asupply chain infrastructure that has traditionally relied on human labor to pick, sort, pack, and process items for delivery. These manual processes are monotonous, error-prone, and sometimes dangerous, have extremely high worker turnover. The automation of these processes elevates worker roles and brings greater consistency to the processes. The innovation developed during this Phase II project may enable broader automation of complex materials handling processes by creating novel training systems for artificial intelligence-enabled robotic systems that are configured specifically for individual customer needs. This innovation may increase US supply chain resilience, enabling citizens to rapidly and reliably obtain necessities such as food, medicine, and health supplies without needing to leave their homes. The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a high-throughput biofabrication platform that can create physiologically relevant in vitro tissue models for diverse applications including drug testing, assay development, therapeutics, and biomedical research. The current drug development process is lengthy, inefficient, and expensive. It costs about $1.8 billion and takes 12-15 years to launch a single drug. Approximately 92% of the drugs that passed preclinical testing failed in subsequent human trials, highlighting the lack of adequate preclinical testing tools to generate predictive data. Failure to detect the drug-induced toxicity to the vital human organs in clinical trials often leads to market withdrawal of the drug after launch, which causes enormous financial losses to the drug manufacturer and also negative physical and mental effects for patients. The proposed technology will significantly improve drug safety, increase the efficiency and lower the cost of drug development by providing more reliable and clinically relevant drug testing results in a high-throughput fashion. This technology can also provide patient-specific tissues for critical biomedical research (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo therapeutic applications, providing a viable solution to diseases without no cures or effective treatment yet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-throughput biofabrication platform that is compatible with the high-throughput screening (HTS) systems widely used for drug screening and assay development. Currently, the key bottleneck for traditional microfabrication strategies and mainstream nozzle-based bioprinters is the lack of scalability and throughput to accommodate scalable manufacturing necessary in HTS systems. With the growing adoption of 3D biomimetic human tissue models in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a critical need for advanced manufacturing systems that enable rapid and streamlined tissue fabrication methods that are compatible with already established HTS platforms for preclinical toxicity testing of potential drug candidates. The proposed project will develop a parallel optical projection-based 3D bioprinting platform for direct manufacturing of 3D tissues within multiwell plates commonly used in the HTS systems. Implementation of the proposed 3D bioprinting system will permit subsequent in situ drug screening or assay testing directly within the wells and drastically improve biofabrication workflow efficiencies for the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research community. This bioprinter will serve as a powerful instrument for the mass production of 3D tissue models at the industrial scale to advance drug discovery and assay development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project will be to empower and educate caregivers to make scientifically guided decisions that enable safer and optimally nurturing sleep environments for infants.  Every year more than 130 million babies are born and over 4 million of those are born in the U.S.  Due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 300 babies every month may not live to see their first birthday.  SIDS remains the leading cause of death for babies aged one month to one year.  Infant mortality rates in the U.S. are higher than in the 20 wealthiest nations.  Innogized Technologies has developed a transformative Internet of Things technology (IoT) that combines hardware and analytics to enable caregivers to make better sleep-time decisions, avoiding overheating, a known stressor for SIDS.  The technology guides caregivers to deliver optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth for their infants anywhere and anytime, while at the same time relieving anxiety.  This technology is poised to immediately capture a sizable portion of the rapidly growing $1 billion US baby monitoring solutions market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a novel consumer product that works  with caregivers to proactively mitigate the risk of under/overheating events in newborns. Sleep-time clothing choices are thermodynamically matched with environmental conditions to create baby-specific safe sleep environments.  The temperatures are  maintained by leveraging the inherent connectivity of the IoT platform. The technology integrates thermal resistance measurements, thermal models and maps, advanced algorithms, and predictive monitoring.  The research objectives of the project tackle the most important remaining technical challenges driving towards successful commercialization and adoption of a product that is essentially an intelligent system, capable of understanding context and tracking and managing complex interactions while anticipating requirements.  The technical product of this research will advance caregiver knowledge and increase understanding of the applied thermodynamics leading to the advantageous state of thermoneutrality as well as increase infant wellbeing.

    This broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop low-cost, biodegradable biopolymers to replace non-degradable, single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.  Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.

    The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability of a novel reactive extrusion technology, capable of producing biodegradable and compostable thermoplastics with lignin contents of at least 50 weight percent, using solvent-free reactive processing. The polymer alloys will have mechanical properties comparable to commodity polymers, such as low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and thermophilic composting conditions in under 6 months. These materials will be validated for commercial scale production using twin-screw extruders, converted to raw material feedstocks used in plastics manufacturing including filament, pellets, and sheet, and then converted with standard equipment into products such as containers for agriculture, floral, and forestry plant production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device supporting multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. The success of this project would not only benefit patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce health care expenditures by decreasing the length of hospitalization as well as associated medical resources. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research brings together academic collaborators from different fields of expertise. The project provides a unique experience and training for engineers and scientists in the fields of neural interface design and medical device experiments, bridging the gap between the engineering and medical communities, as well as promoting and cultivating future neural engineers to focus on developing emerging/unmet diagnostic and therapeutic devices for improving human health.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops and demonstrates a wireless, miniaturized, intraluminal bioelectronic capsule capable of performing on-demand neuromodulation and multi-modality sensing on the gastrointestinal tract, supporting closed-loop neuromodulation. The device will be tested and characterized on benchtop and also through porcine models to demonstrate its potential for treating and monitoring post-surgical complications. The lengthy process of diagnosing and treating post-surgical complications significantly increases healthcare costs. Costs from hospitalization time alone exceed $2,000 per day for post-operative ileus alone.  Additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could reduce hospitalization time, accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life for patients. The success of this project has the potential to bring disruptive impact and revolution to the current pharmaceutical-based post-surgical management and treatment. In addition, the technology developed during this project may be useful to treat other chronic diseases and injuries that are incurable pharmaceutically.  The technique may be used as research tools for investigating the biological mechanisms and new therapeutics for different diseases.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to optimize a system to rapidly synthesize long, user-defined sequences of DNA as a commercial service. The process will be capable of producing error-free DNA fragments, each long enough to encode multiple genes, in 1-2 weeks, at a price that will be affordable even to university research labs. Researchers currently can purchase short DNA fragments that must be stitched together to make functional genes – which is labor-intensive and sometimes impossible – or pay vendors to do it. The ability to buy an intact group of genes on one piece of DNA will help deepen the understanding of all biological systems, from animals and plants to the bacteria and viruses that infect them. Easy access to long DNAs will also allow synthetic biologists to build completely novel biological devices, such as bacteria that manufacture vitamins or medicines, cells that detect and destroy cancer, or new sustainable food ingredients and novel biomaterials.

    The proposed project is focused on developing an enzymatic method for DNA synthesis that will alleviate several problems inherent to chemical DNA synthesis, the only method currently available commercially. Chemical synthesis works well for short DNA fragments, but high-quality synthesis is limited to <200 bases. Longer fragments often are created by stitching together many short fragments, but this process is unreliable for sequences that contain repeats or high AT or GC content. In the proposed enzymatic DNA synthesis method, a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is conjugated to the template-independent polymerase Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) by a cleavable linker. When presented with a DNA primer, the dNTP-TdT conjugate adds its tethered nucleotide and remains attached, blocking further elongation by other conjugates. Cleavage of the linker releases the TdT, to be washed away with unreacted conjugates, and exposes the oligo for extension with the next dNTP-TdT conjugate. These two steps of “extension” and “deprotection” are iterated to synthesize a defined sequence. The accuracy of the resulting DNA strand depends on the stability and cleavage efficiency of the linker. A variety of linkages and cleavage enzymes will be tested to yield >99.9% stability and cleavage in rapid, 30-second reactions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves both reduced costs for technology companies as well as increased access to cutting-edge engineering jobs for people from all backgrounds.  Commercializing this product will provide the market with an innovative, automated solution that reduces the time hiring managers spend on recruiting and growing the best candidates.  Until now, metacognitive skill development has been the purview of in-person mentors – a practice that provides fewer on-ramps into engineering careers for individuals from backgrounds historically underrepresented in technology as they often lack access to in-person engineer mentors. A scalable system which delivers metacognitive benefits to users in an automated way may create greater access to technology education by reducing the need for in-person mentorship. The product will also enable job seekers to enhance their engineering potential by strengthening the "hard to teach" practices which distinguish professional engineers from aspiring ones. Overall, the product commercialized during Phase II seeks to increase broader participation in engineering careers and a more equitable set of hiring practices in technology companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project brings cutting-edge Cognitive Science to bear on the problems of manual candidate screening and ongoing employee upskilling. For the first-time, it marries an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and opens the door to build talent pipelines for individuals whose metacognitive traits match closely with the needs of tech employers.  The proposed project combines key advances in the field of Cognitive Science with best practices in software design in order to create novel user interactions inside a Computer-Based Learning Environment (CBLE).  Objectives include: 1) collecting microdata (also called "trace data") from user interactions to make automated inferences about the user's metacognitive traits and 2) creating inputs designed to foster metacognitive growth.  Correlating real-time trace data with metacognitive ability is a new area of research enabled only recently by the increased adoption of CBLEs.  The proposed project contributes to the fields of Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction by validating novel methods measuring metacognition against existing static look-back techniques. The project also pioneers new modes of delivering personalized metacognitive growth through CBLE interaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, high-performance platform to monitor and characterize plankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be harmful or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns and economic consequences, such as billions lost annually in the aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms and sea lice. The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collections and evaluation. In contrast, the proposed platform may enable low-cost, portable and fast monitoring, as well as automated characterization of harmful aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, this platform will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets such as marine biology science and STEM education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, and production algae monitoring. The proposed technology is envisioned to have a significant societal impact and commercial potential.

    This project may result in a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput aquatic microobjects monitoring instrument.  The instrument will have a wide spectrum of applications and initial focus on aquaculture market. The technology will initially focus on early identification of specific microorganisms, such as sea lice and harmful algae as they are detrimental to the wellbeing of aquaculture animals. This demonstration will provide high quality data at an affordable price to ensure confidence and credibility to aquaculture farmers, marine scientists, and other users interested in aquatic microobjects characterization. To accomplish this plan, several operating regimes will be implemented enabling the device to switch from high-resolution (monitoring harmful algae) to high-throughput (identifying sea lice).  An autofluorescent camera module will be developed to further assist with differentiating microorganisms. Next, an innovative neural network framework will be developed and tested for identification of different types of sea lice and harmful algae. Finally, the system will be integrated into an environmentally protected enclosure and rigorously tested in laboratory, as well as in-field in realistic conditions. At the end of the Phase II program a prototype will be completed that will be designed in coordination with aquaculture partners and prospective users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient system for robust point-of-care blood tests.  The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and represent a bottleneck.  This Phase II effort will explore the design and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated by comparison
    of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead separation assay with a conventional centrifugation process.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the efficiency of air traffic operations and increase airport and airspace capacity utilization, enabling reductions in emissions, noise impact, flight delays, and operational costs of airports and airlines. The anticipated result is to produce a software platform that will become an industry standard used by 200 major metropolitan airports and over 50 airlines globally, addressing an available market of over $100 Million. The technology may contribute to a sustainable future aviation system that enables economic growth, while minimizing environmental impact. Preliminary development and testing of the technology in New York indicates the potential to increase airport and airspace capacity by as much as 20%, with savings for delays, fuel burn, noise impact and controller workload from 10%-21%, and cost savings of $2 Billion/year. The proposed innovation may increase the understanding of airspace operations and related trade-offs by bridging the gap between aviation professionals and the public through 3D visualizations of proposed airspace changes and quantification of their expected impacts on the environment and safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a software platform for integrated airspace and airport system planning, design, and management. Currently, airport authorities, airlines, and air navigation service providers use legacy software tools for the above. These tools are outdated and difficult to use, fail to properly quantify trade-offs between design objectives, and produce unsustainable design solutions leading to sub-optimal system performance. The research objectives of this project are to unify the disjointed functions of design, planning and performance evaluation of airport operations, quantify trade-offs between competing design objectives, and optimize for system efficiency in terms of maximizing safety and capacity while minimizing delays, emissions, noise, fuel burn and operational cost. To achieve this, the company will work with major airports and airlines to identify key requirements, develop tractable mathematical models for addressing the tasks and validate the results via application in real operational environments. The anticipated technical result is a unified software platform that will enable airports/airlines to be more efficient, while also balancing operational, societal, and environmental objectives in building a sustainable aviation system for the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients’ quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help advance the health and welfare of individuals living with retinal and neurological disease. This includes multiple sclerosis (MS)—a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A fully automated, wearable, and low-cost retinal imaging device will be developed for use in both clinical and home settings that detects changes in the retina, allowing patients and their physicians to more routinely track treatment efficacy and ocular side effects. Early detection and treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and positively impact the research and care of other retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal pathology. While OCT is a widely-used modality for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for unsupervised use by patients at home. This includes a ruggedized and ergonomic design suited for those who suffer from low vision, low mobility, and other symptoms that make frequent trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly as often as prescribed by their doctor, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Complete development of a clinical-grade beta prototype that is suitable for use in clinical and home settings, 2) Develop a software pipeline for automated image analysis and report, and 3) Conduct a usability study in a cohort of AMD patients with varying degrees of vision loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20% and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776 million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, 11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain diabetic foot ulcers each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible, robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the prototype and scale up hardware production.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the development of disruptive technologies that use drones and artificial intelligence to monitor livestock.  Almost 75% of United States cattle are purchased by taking out bank loans, and lenders need to audit cattle inventories for collateral verification and appraisal purposes.  Additionally, more than 140,000 ranchers need to monitor their herds and detect cattle illnesses before infections spread.  The proposed technology will leverage aerial imaging and artificial intelligence to count cattle, characterize cattle weight, and diagnose cattle illnesses up to one week before clinical symptoms appear.  The ability to count herds regularly will enable ranchers to discover cattle rustling issues early and provide banks with a reliable way to perform collateral verification on ranches and feedlots, ensuring that banks can continue extending livestock operations the loans that they need to survive.  The ability to detect cattle illnesses early is expected to reduce cattle mortalities, the economic cost of antibiotic use, and possibly antibiotic resistance in humans.  Ultimately, the proposed technology that will be developed for monitoring cattle promises to also transform the way that land and marine wildlife, fisheries, and endangered species are monitored.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide cattlemen and bankers with an efficient way to detect and count cattle on pastures and ranches, estimate livestock weight, and identify ill cows before they spread infection further.  Despite daily monitoring of cattle herds, small discrepancies and losses are undiscoverable, and bovine illnesses are often left undetected until they spread, infecting more cattle and requiring large-scale administration of antibiotics.  Machine learning and image processing tools will be developed that (a) automatically analyze natural and thermal drone images to count cattle on multi-topography ranches and estimate livestock weight and (b) discriminate between healthy and ill cattle based on aerial radiometric imaging. The outcomes will be (1) a ready, drone-agnostic solution for counting cattle and estimating their weight and (2) a pilot-tested drone-and-software system for monitoring cattle health via radiometric imaging and notifying cattlemen about cows with suspected illness in real-time.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project falls within the scope of the grand challenges\
    \ in health informatics. There are excellent protocols for the management and\
    \ treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once\
    \ patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Ischemic stroke affects\
    \ 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth\
    \ leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Health care\
    \ providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these\
    \ interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting.\
    \ Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited tools to help\
    \ patients recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients\
    \ with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke\
    \ symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor\
    \ patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide\
    \ coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom\
    \ monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through\
    \ their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will\
    \ allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders\
    \ and diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project\
    \ addresses the real-time detection of stroke.  IV tissue plasminogen activator\
    \ (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible\
    \ patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room after initial\
    \ stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular\
    \ therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours for these treatments,\
    \ respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms\
    \ of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge.\
    \ The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational\
    \ solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency\
    \ response in a timely manner. The solution consists of a cloud-based analysis\
    \ system for real-time detection of stroke onset, enabled by body-worn sensors\
    \ and a mobile app. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve\
    \ stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients arriving in the\
    \ hospital in time for IV tPA treatment and other reperfusion therapies.\n\nThis\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development and adoption of next generation portable energy storage devices.  Lithium-ion batteries are the most common energy storage technology for a wide variety of applications. Most recently, they have been adopted by small to medium sized Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and electric vehicles (EV). The weight carrying capacity and flight/operating time and range of these UAS and EV are issues mainly dependent on battery components and materials.  With the proposed lithium-ion battery technology, high-capacity, lightweight, and advanced batteries may store significantly more energy without increasing their weight. The development and integration of the next generation battery technology may significantly increase the performance of battery powered vehicles and their adoption by society. This technology has the potential to have a drastic commercial impact in the UAS/drone industry; For example, with successful batteries, medicine, blood, and organs can be quickly delivered to remote locations on unmanned platforms. Utility workers may be able to identify pipeline leaks or transmission line damages in advance of an accident and packages may be delivered faster, with significantly less carbon footprint, along with myriad of other applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop high capacity, lightweight lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells with a novel carbon-based anode component. Existing LIBs still utilize graphite with additives as the primary anode material due to their ability to restore the charge and provide consistency in voltage. However, graphite's limited capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of long lasting, higher energy density (over 340 Wh/kg) LIBs. Graphite's internal structure limits sufficient lithium diffusion into interlayer spaces. This project offers a new class of higher energy density (over 500 Wh/kg) LIBs, with an innovative multilayer graphenic anode.  Replacing graphite with the multilayer graphenic anode offers a solution in overcoming the issue of the  limited capacity of the carbon anode. This patent-pending, commercially feasible, only carbon-based anode has the unique capability of an intense lithium (Li) intercalation within its networks. The large Li/electrolyte interface contributes enhanced charge-transfer kinetics, resulting in effective charge/discharge cycling throughout hundreds of cycles with over 1500 mAh/g specific capacity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to improve fruit and vegetable storage and dairy powder production in situations that currently require additives and carrier agents during the high-temperature processing techniques. The creation of novel, high-quality, shelf-stable food products is an important step toward increasing food system sustainability and accessibility.  The team seeks to increase shelf-stability, reducing reliance on the expensive and limited cold chain. This technology has potential applications for pharmaceutical drug preservation. Additionally, global water shortages have increased reliance on desalination technologies that are expensive and environmentally taxing. With the potential cost, scalability, and portability benefits of the proposed separation technology, there is further potential for use in water treatment.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to further develop a hybrid separation technology combining supercritical fluids and sonication to instantly separate a solute and solvent at operational temperatures of 15-55 °C, with inputs as low as 1% solids.  The technology results in products with particles sizes of <10um to >250um and varying crystallization without hardware changes. By creating a continuous separation effect using velocity (supersonic flow as the kinetic driving force for phase separation instead of heat), the technology overcomes the end-product quality limitations of traditional thermal drying techniques, and has the potential to scale with attractive unit economics,.  This method is significantly more energy efficient than existing methodologies. Specifically, the technology can produce pure fruit, vegetable, and dairy powders without preprocessing concentration steps, additives, carrier agents, or thermal treatment.  The method may also be used to develop drug formulations for aerosol delivery and/or enhanced bioavailability, streamline sugar manufacturing to create co-energy generation, and potentially offer cost effective compact desalination systems to make drinkable water. The Phase II research seeks to design, construct, and optimize a scalable pilot system through computational fluid dynamics modeling, custom fabrication, and analytical testing to validate the unit economics and end-product attributes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality and efficiency of bedside spinal access procedures by developing a needle guidance system that interfaces with existing ultrasound machines. Lumbar punctures (LPs) are performed to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as meningitis. The traditional LP technique requires practitioners to manually feel for spinal landmarks to form a mental image of the anatomy before blindly inserting the needle into the spine, aiming for a small target containing spinal fluid. This methodology can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming and is highly dependent on practitioner experience and patient body type. Up to 42% of procedures fail to access the target. Failed cases require radiological intervention, increasing the cost of care, lengthening patient stay, and exposing patients to radiation. Hospitals in the United States lose an estimated $2 billion annually due to inefficiencies and failures in LPs. The proposed needle guidance system will enable bedside spinal access procedures to be performed under real-time ultrasound imaging, significantly improving first-attempt success rates. The guidance technology can further be applied in other clinical segments, improving the quality of care across a variety of needle-based procedures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) Complete development of a needle guidance system designed to interface with existing ultrasound machines; and 2) Develop an AI-powered anatomy detection software feature for the guidance system. These combined objectives will generate a functional, intuitive, and accessible solution that minimizes barriers to adoption while maximizing clinical and operational value. The proposed research involves conducting an array of safety and reliability studies to investigate the performance of the guidance system under realistic conditions. In developing a robust anatomy detection software feature, a spinal ultrasound data set will be created from a variety of non-patient volunteers. The data will be analyzed, processed, and used to train a machine learning model for anatomy detection. It is anticipated that the results of this project will demonstrate a sufficiently safe and efficacious system that can consistently guide a needle to an intended target with an error of less than 3 millimeters. The anatomy detection feature is expected to perform with at least 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity in identifying five key spinal landmarks; this level of performance would significantly reduce the knowledge barrier to performing ultrasound-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to increase the quality of consumer products and services by scaling the data sharing economy. Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are “messy" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with “feature stores,” which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to unleash the potential of water as a thermal energy storage medium for building air conditioning. Today’s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns.  First, materials testing will be completed after a year’s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to close gaps in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) proficiency, improving participation and sustained achievement, particularly for historically underserved student populations. Learning science has validated that the mathematical sciences are processed experientially — through seeing, moving, doing, perceiving — but current educational solutions generally do not explore this learning modality.  This platform will utilize Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and advanced analytics to scale these best practice pedagogies for both students and teachers. The aim of this project is to actualize the vision of technology-assisted STEM learning and operationalize it across the US K-12 system to close long-standing barriers to access and proficiency at scale.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform offers a way to rapidly close significant learning gaps students are facing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate how multimodal and game-driven learning in IVR can be used to enhance math proficiencies and the ability to transfer mathematical knowledge across contexts.  Such abilities have so far eluded incumbent learning technologies and interventions for math. In particular, this research may culminate in an experiential solution for students to learn Algebra efficiently, effectively, and purposefully. Immersed in relevant real-world contexts, students will use tactile 3D tools, movement, and a research-based pedagogical framework to build lasting fluency with math concepts while solving high impact problems. The platform will leverage the latest advances in data analysis to personalize learning experiences based on individual behaviors, skills and goals. This solution provides teachers with real-time data on student thinking so they can closely monitor, identify, and support priority students while providing timely feedback during critical cognitive moments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce a fusion-based engine in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive. The ultimate system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy.  Since the system is small and has low radiation, it also has applications for manned space flight.  This new engine could enable more direct and shorter flights to other planets, which minimizes the exposure of astronauts to the radiation encountered in outer space.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue the companies research on using a harmonic well to produce fusion by particle kinetic energy, rather than general thermal energy. The proposed concept utilizes a new heat engine technique that always maintains the plasma distribution function in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the proposed fusion system, a plasma is created in a specially designed harmonic well and then induced to form into two counter-oscillating spinning rings. When the two rings collide at the center of the well, the particle velocities are high enough to cause fusion.   This phase of the project will increase the energetics of the device. The project will move up to deuterium, a fuel which is twice as heavy as hydrogen (the current fuel) and has a much larger cross-section for fusion. The proposed approach is expected to make the harmonic well sufficiently energetic to produce deuterium-on-deuterium fusion by increasing the natural oscillation frequency of the well to give ion collision speeds of about one million meters per second. The project expects to be able to detect the neutrons produced by the fusion, demonstrating aneutronic fusion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is related to the underserved, emergent bilingual population in US school systems. In spite of their growing size (approximately 20 percent of the total US population), emergent bilinguals still do not have adequate support to succeed in academic settings and are often victims of a subtractive bilingualism process that favors the acquisition of English at the expense of the home language. The lack of adequate bilingual resources has led to a disproportionate misplacement of emergent bilinguals in special education as well as an increased drop-out rates in bilingual populations, in general, and Latino communities in particular. To address these problems, a recommendation system powered by machine-learning algorithms that will generate a personalized bundle of fun, bilingual literacy activities linked to a fully-automated bilingual assessment is proposed. The unique characteristic of this solution is that the personalized activities are generated automatically based on assessment results and activity performance. The goal of the activities is to develop the skills identified by the assessment as needing improvement, both in English and in the home language of the child.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the educational needs of the growing, school-age, emergent bilingual population (i.e. children in the school system whose home language is not English or only English), as well as the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic acumen for society as a whole. The main research objectives involve: a) designing game-like bilingual activities that can get the young child’s attention, b) developing age-appropriate and culturally-sensitive content for the bilingual activities, c) refining the speech recognizer to work well with children's speech in both Spanish and English, and d) implementing the latest trends in data-analysis and machine-learning technologies to develop a recommendation system that proposes personalized activities tailored to each child’s needs based on assessment results and activity performance. The research and development plan aims at developing an innovative product that stands out from existing solutions. The key differentiator features are: 1) its focus on bilingual children and its adaptability in accepting bilingual answers for the activities, 2) its capacity to help children develop speaking skills due to the integration of automatic measures of speech performance, and 3) its recommendation engine that suggests personalized bilingual activities for each student tailored to their specific needs.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.  Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks, develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed decisions.

    The research and development activities include: (1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps. These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods, potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaska’s environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-makers.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants, including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over 85%.

    The proposed project turns supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling. Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new markets, such as wastewater treatment.  Recovery of compression energy during SCWO has been demonstrated previously.  This project's goals are to further optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours between major services.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in teaching K-12 and college students STEM concepts in the fun-filled context of designing, building, and programming machines and robots and preparing them for the future technology-driven jobs. This project seeks to make robotics education affordable, equitable, and inclusive for students at all grade levels. By taking a multi-disciplinary and cross-curricula approach, the product developed through this project engages students, especially women and minorities from diverse backgrounds, effectively in STEM disciplines and helps them make suitable career choices. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce and help fill the 2.5 million STEM jobs that are vacant according to the current US Department of Labor Statistics. The technological innovations emerging from this project would result in a computational tool for synthesis of robot motions, which can be used broadly in industrial automation and invention of machines and robots. The proposed design-driven educational robotics product has the potential to improve engagement with science and technology and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to bring together rigid body kinematics, machine learning, and engineering design to create a new product for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools, freshman college programs, and STEM camps. The leading commercially available educational robotic systems emphasize 1) instruction-driven prototyping of robot structures using many specialized parts, and 2) programming them without providing any intuition behind the design process or guidance to creating mechanism design concepts for the realization of the motion of the robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, new science standards, and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This product would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. If successful, this project would result in a state-of-the-art motion design software, a novel hardware kit, and standards-aligned curriculum and learning resources for schools and colleges. The software based on the machine learning in mechanism design research will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide students necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.

    The proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    \ Phase II project is to address health concerns associated with peanut allergies.\
    \ Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for\
    \ those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut\
    \ allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising\
    \ incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free\
    \ peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen\
    \ the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits:\
    \ (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives\
    \ by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut,\
    \ (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their\
    \ families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting\
    \ food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination.\
    \ \n \nThe proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free\
    \ peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing\
    \ tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\
    \ and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after\
    \ contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound\
    \ to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut\
    \ allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for\
    \ the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h\
    \ 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens.\
    \ The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara\
    \ h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut\
    \ plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble\
    \ lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize\
    \ the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative\
    \ development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions. If the resulting\
    \ plants demonstrate tolerance to the gene deletions, the allergen-free peanut\
    \ will be very significant in protecting the peanut sensitive populations and\
    \ promoting peanut sales.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has\

    \  It will also purify other important biomolecules from the same sample, such\

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail items moving in and out of buildings.  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  This project will address these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The effort is focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase its effectiveness.  If successful, the project will address critical public health and safety challenges.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset.  No commercially viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One challenge is the detection of liquid or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame – such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device.  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a novel non-toxic antifoulant that keeps the hulls of vessels clear of biofouling without the environmental harm imposed by today's current antifoulant products.  Biofouling is the accumulation of algae, barnacles, and other marine organisms on underwater surfaces such as the hulls of ships and boats.  A ship with a biofouled hull experiences drag, which slows it down and drives up fuel consumption by as much as 40%.  For the global shipping industry, this increase imposes an annual fuel cost penalty of $36 billion. Moreover, the excess fuel consumption due to biofouling adds 386 million tons of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.  Over 90% of antifoulants in the market today contain copper, a toxic biocide harmful to the marine ecosystem.  This project will develop a competitive antifoulant which avoids harmful environmental impacts.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project develops a first-of-its-kind antifouling marine coating that is high-performing and safe for use in aquatic ecosystems.  This antifouling coating contains no biocides but delivers antifouling performance matching that of the market leading copper coatings. The novel coating consists of a hydrophilic polymeric material that is naturally antifouling.  It prevents biofouling by creating a liquid barrier around a surface which masks the surface from fouling marine organisms. While other hydrophilic coatings are notoriously unstable in aqueous environments, this innovation includes a method of application that helps to greatly increase the coating's stability and durability. The objectives of this Phase II project are to tune the formulation of the novel coating to meet marine end user performance requirements and regulatory benchmarks and to demonstrate small-batch production capabilities.  The outcome of this work will be a rigorously tested, ready high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable advanced 3D printing materials to solve challenges in emerging electronic devices, transportation technologies, heating and cooling system for buildings, and in thermal management in manufacturing processes. Overheating is a major challenge as electrical devices continue to grow more compact and energy dense. Heat exchangers manufactured through traditional methods are often expensive and energy intensive to fabricate and suffer from corrosion, limited performance, and high maintenance costs. Traditional mold tools machined from metals are often expensive, require long lead times, and have limited design freedom. To address these challenges, this project will develop a platform of novel high thermal conductivity composite materials that can be used to 3D print parts that enhance electronics cooling and performance while also reducing the product weight and cost, can improve heat exchanger performance while also reducing corrosion, fouling and associated maintenance, and can also be used to 3D print low cost and high-performance molds with low-cost capital and short lead times. The project will result in an advanced materials platform for engineers to create parts with metal-like thermal conductivity, but with the speed, low cost, and ultimate design freedom of printing plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develops 3D printable, plastic composite materials with 500x higher thermal conductivity than standard plastics. The unique materials incorporate continuous wires and fibers in 3D printing filaments to achieve thermal conductivity values not possible in traditionally manufactured composite parts.  The polymer composite shell and wire/fiber core can be tailored to offer high strength, high temperature stability, and even joule heating. These materials are printed directly on commercially available and low-cost Independent Dual Extrusion (IDEX) 3D printers using a modified hardware and software platform. Printing and filament production will be accomplished through the following five objectives: 1) finalize filament formulations for the desired material properties, 2) establish a pilot scale filament manufacturing line to demonstrate production scalability, 3) complete minor 3D printer hardware modifications to accommodate filament printing, 4) develop software to print and optimize parts for desired properties, and 5) print application examples and validate product performance with commercially relevant demonstrations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve personnel safety from flammable gas leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential facilities. Additionally, the technology contributes to combating climate change by tackling one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.  The technology enables the mitigation of methane and refrigerant leaks that constitutes a significant market opportunity in the oil, gas and HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) markets. The innovation may solve important technical bottlenecks that have prevented widespread adoption of pervasive gas sensing in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As an enabling system, it may be utilized in a variety of other applications area such as the detection of explosives, narcotics, chemical weapons, indoor air quality monitoring, and diagnosis of disease via breath analysis.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a gas sensor with an unparalleled combination of size, power, and cost while offering high detection performance. The proposed architecture fabricates high-frequency bulk acoustic resonators directly on the backend of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) integrated circuit chips which permits low-cost, mass-production and improved noise characteristics of the sensors. The direct co-integration also allows the fabrication of a receptor array to obtain responses from multiple target analytes that can be used to classify materials and for real-time calibration against environmental confounders. The objective of this project is the development of a single-chip gas sensor based on co-integrated piezoelectric materials. This effort will consist of the design, fabrication and characterization of integrated resonator arrays onto silicon circuits; integration of the chips with receptor materials, allowing selective adsorption of target gas molecules; and testing to assess the gas sensing performance.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the optics and lenses used in near infrared 3D imaging.  Glass lenses, which have excellent transmittance and thermal properties, are used in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and rangefinders for distances beyond a few tens of meters.  Polymer lenses, which are moldable and lower cost, are typically used in consumer-mobile 3D cameras and emerging automotive LiDAR systems.  The refractive indices of these lenses limit the numerical aperture and require longer-than-desired lens barrels.  The proposed polymeric chalcogenide lenses combine infrared transmittance, index, and thermal properties with the cost and moldability of optical polymers.  The innovation enables the molding of freeform polymer lenses with increased numerical aperture and reduced barrel lengths.  These properties make possible more compact, lighter, and lower cost 3D imagers.  With these advantages, rangefinders can be more easily carried and scan faster and smartphone cameras can have wider viewing angles.  Additionally, LiDAR systems can image more accurately around a vehicle and improve both driver and pedestrian safety.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance sulfur polymer chemistry and materials processing for the development of a new class of near infrared (NIR) optical components.  Innovative chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering has led to the development of a new class of optical polymers with the potential for imaging applications in the NIR.  As a result of extensive optical and mechanical characterization, including the determination of the optical constants over the full infrared spectrum, measurement of mechanical properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, measurement of thermo-optic coefficients, and determination of stress-optic coefficients, the materials will now be developed and integrated for product applications with innovative optical designs based on material's unique property set.  Freeform optical design concepts will be used which, to date, have not often been used in infrared imaging.  Such designs may lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for infrared imaging applications, further leveraging the advantages of the material's transmission spectrum, incorporating absorption, bulk scattering and surface scattering, and surface scattering contributions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help patients with cardiorespiratory conditions, including sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia. The project will develop a wearable sensor platform to simultaneously diagnose and monitor conditions. Multiple physiological measurements are collected by a comfortable, wireless sensor patch, resulting in a convenient remote monitoring clinical framework. Interfacing sensor data with an efficient cloud-based provider portal and automated algorithms will enable rapid screening of the 24 million undiagnosed sleep apnea patients in the United States. The proposed innovation will also provide insight into the practical clinical benefits and efficiencies to be gained by bundling multiple comorbid or otherwise related diagnostic pathways into a single workflow, such as reducing time to treatment for comorbid atrial fibrillation. This remote monitoring bundle concept represents the only all-in-one device capable of servicing multiple highly pervasive health challenges in a method unobtrusive and user-friendly for both the patient and the provider - particularly for telemedicine applications made more urgent by the global pandemic.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a simple, accurate, cloud-connected wearable patch and collect clinical comparison data to develop automated, low-power algorithms to simultaneously detect sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, and cardiac arrhythmias. The project integrates materials science, mechanical engineering, and signal processing approaches to detect critical physiological signals from the torso, including oxygen saturation and several hemodynamic metrics. The project will also conduct studies that offer early insights into the clinical benefits of bundled workflows across cardiac and sleep medicine specialties.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include the ability to enhance the security and trust of critical infrastructure networks for applications including defense, electric grids, health care, and emerging autonomous systems (i.e., self-driving vehicles and robotics), as many of these systems are mission- and life-critical. The proposed innovation will allow distributed and autonomous systems the ability to make decisions based on highly trusted data sources. More importantly, the innovation addresses an immediate customer need to stop data breaches and prevent unauthorized activity on networks under flaky and uncertain conditions. The proposed innovation will enhance the practical applications of distributed computing fault tolerance and consensus mechanisms by applying them to real-world critical infrastructure networks. Mission-critical systems data are constantly under attack by adversaries at the rate of a billion times per year. For mission-critical systems, compromised data is a serious problem including huge economic losses, potential for mission failures, and in some situations, life-critical consequences. Protecting that data/information is one of the biggest market opportunities of this decade and the proposed work addresses the concerns of information assurance directly.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance an innovation that solves the complex problem of maintaining data integrity for mission-critical data within critical infrastructure networks.  The proposed innovation simplifies the extremely complex science of consensus and fault tolerance in distributed systems by combining flexible deployment of state-of-the-art Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT)consensus algorithms with the proposed novel file system innovation, creating highly useful solution to protect data integrity before it can be compromised under varying network operating conditions including asynchronous network conditions (byzantine and crash fault scenarios, ability to retain all transactions, provide liveness guarantees, maintain local node state integrity, and maintain data ordering and timestamps). The proposed file system solution is designed to be an easy to deploy software platform that keeps data safe, tamper-resistant, verifiable, and trusted over the system’s life cycle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the enablement of verifiable and confidential computing through research and development that improves the performance and cost of the underlying cryptographic computations. Digital services play a foundational role in varied sectors including communication, education, banking, and others. Without cryptography these services would be impossible to conduct online in a secure and private manner. However, many new and more powerful cryptographic techniques remain out of reach due to their computationally expensive nature. Reducing the cost of these operations enables not just secure communication, but also verifiable and confidential computation, of rapidly growing interest to both the enterprise and government segments for use cases such as privacy-preserving machine learning. The market for verifiable and confidential computing solutions is expected to grow to over one billion dollars in the next five years.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and develop a high performance cloud-based system for verifiable and confidential computing. Currently many verifiable and confidential computing techniques can not be brought into production due to their computationally expensive nature. This project performs algorithmic research, hardware design, and software development, that will improve the performance and cost of these operations. In particular, this project optimizes cryptographic algorithms to make them more amenable to GPU-based processing, optimize the software implementation of those algorithms to target GPU architectures, devise methods for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and develop a scale-out architecture that dynamically scales capacity as the complexity of uses and number of users grow. With the appropriate design, the project expects to develop a system with over an order of magnitude or more performance than existing designs. Furthermore, by creating a ‘cloud-based’ infrastructure, these resources can be made available to developers around the world, with low latency and low cost. The expected improvements in performance, cost, and access will enable new use cases that have previously been impractical.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the widespread adoption of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) by developing and commercializing a decentralized control and optimization platform capable of aggregating and managing millions of independent energy assets connected across the U.S. electric grid. The resulting end-to-end solution will enable private and public project developers, as well as utilities to quickly commission and cost effectively operate DER systems composed of solar arrays, batteries, generators, fuel cells and many other kinds of energy assets in residential, commercial, and industrial sites with complete confidence on the reliability, seamless grid integration, and economic performance of the systems. By making it that much easier and cheaper to own, integrate, and operate clean energy equipment, the resulting solution will transform the energy industry from the ground up, using DERs as the pillars of a new clean, resilient, and equitable grid.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will drastically simplify the way distributed energy resources (DER) systems are commissioned, aggregated, and operated. Such deployments are complex due to an endemic lack of standardization, the sheer number of key variables to control and optimize, and the lack of modularity in conventional approaches. Properly coordinating them as they continue to rapidly increase in number on the grid requires a decentralized approach that puts the decision-making at the DER level.  The project consists of two stages: (1) A development phase, where the algorithms will be integrated into a best-in-class solution, which will include all the necessary end-user facing tools, cloud infrastructure, and edge devices to enable full automation of deployments and satisfy technical requirements of customers in the mainstream market; and (2) a demonstration phase, where the resulting solution will be used at two different sites and benchmarked against critical use cases to validate its benefits and leverage the results to scale up market penetration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a Personalized Text Simplification (PeTeS) technology to be used as a Computer Assisted Tool for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. Several automatic text simplification tools are available in the market. Unfortunately, the existing tools are one-size-fits-all solutions offering no personalization and not supporting the teacher’s instructional goals. The innovation of PeTeS is in the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification customizing texts for each student, enabling him/her to understand the curriculum and improve vocabulary knowledge at the same time. PeTeS will be compatible with both independent use by students and teacher-driven data-driven instruction. PeTeS will be usable both in class and in remote education settings, which is a new critical demand in our schools caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this Phase II Project is to fully develop the PeTeS product and evaluate its effectiveness in classroom and remote education settings.

    The objective of this Phase II Project is to develop PeTeS a Personalized Text Simplification tool. PeTeS will enable teachers of material in courses such as education, reading, language, and literacy coaches to provide personalized reading accommodations and intervention to their students to improve their reading skills by automatically simplifying the text to match the individual student’s knowledge. PeTeS will be compatible with both independent use by students and teacher-driven data-driven instruction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project based on this SBIR sensor solution, with its high quality and low cost, will enable the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) industry to accelerate the progress to greater functionality of assisted driving, ultimately reaching full autonomy. The subject focal plane array (FPAS) chips may reduce the current US 36,560 annual vehicles deaths (the leading cause of death for those 1-54 years old) as well as reduce the 4.4 million injuries requiring medical attention and the $ 871 billion in damages and health costs. Additionally, improved assisted driving will enhance the mobility of seniors/disabled. Finally, the technology may reduce the societal carbon footprint by reducing congestion as a result of more fuel-efficient acceleration and braking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve the current ADAS sensor suite to increase safety. Current ADAS systems require many different sensor technologies to be implemented simultaneously. These sensors are insufficient to achieve higher levels of autonomy limiting the vehicle’s used in poor conditions. The proposed sensor solution will function in low light and harsh weather conditions with high performance. The added sensor functionalities will reduce the processor bandwidth required to integrate and analyze sensor data and detect road hazards, increasing the accuracy of the system. Overall, this improvement in performance may increase the overall safety in ADAS vehicles. An evaluation system will be developed to characterize the sensor.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve care for pulmonary conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This disease affects 30 million Americans, kills more than 150,000 a year and is the third leading cause of U.S. deaths. COPD costs Americans nearly $72 billion a year, half of which is spent on ER visits and hospital stays resulting from respiratory crises. Hospitalized COPD patients have reduced quality of life, more rapid lung disease progression, and a 50% increase in mortality in the subsequent two years. Currently, ongoing monitoring of COPD lung deterioration relies largely on patient-reported symptoms and inadequate tools (65-70% accurate). As a result, half of COPD deterioration remains undetected. The proposed technology facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of COPD attacks by continuous remote tracking of lung function, thereby preventing unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. This device improves care for long-term conditions like COPD or asthma, but also those with relatively quick onset, such as COVID-19.

    The proposed project advances translation of a device using acoustic resonance to measure lung air volume. The project develops an expanded data set for analysis and deployment at scale. The project further incorporates advanced classification models into the analysis workflow to track and predict deteriorating lung function in a cloud-computing environment. The project will also develop a version to run on a patient's mobile device to enable real-time feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as expanded polystyrene.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will be to address the customized needs of automotive applications with tailored high performance-low cost carbon fiber (HP-LCCF) products that are not currently commercially available. The broader impact of HP-LCCF technology is to enable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies to help mitigate the climate change linked emissions caused by fossil fuel powered vehicles.  Volume projections of HP-LCCF for this application are expected to ramp up significantly over the ten years.  After successful entry into the automotive market, the focus will be expanded to address needs in the wind energy market and with a tailored HP-LCCF product to enable longer blades for larger and more efficient wind turbines.  This technology will help spur global adoption of clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a process where heavy tow carbon fiber is subdivided using an electromechanical splitting process that can maintain an acceptable range of regular tow carbon fiber linear densities.  Subsequent tailoring trials will verify the capability to achieve and maintain the linear density targets provided by the automotive industry partners who will, in turn, perform downstream manufacturability trials.  Subdividing the heavy tows enables a seamless commercial entry into customers' downstream composite manufacturing processes without an inherent, potentially fatal heavy tow defect.  Such defects are typically non-uniform intra-band tension caused by the transverse catenary forces across the tow band.  Achieving high band linear density and variable intra-band tension are significant barriers for the commercial adoption of heavy tow high performance, low cost carbon fibers (HP-LCCF).  The process developed here may eliminate such issues and achieve commercially relevant HP-LCCF.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However, operating in today’s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application.  This project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively.  The technology represents a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete colonoscopies.  The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective, manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure realm.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from improved financial resilience of hundreds of thousands of water-dependent businesses and municipalities currently threatened by hydrologic volatility and severely strained ecosystems. This SBIR research will enable the seamless integration of scientific and financial modeling for the water economy. The innovation lowers the costs and improves the performance of two climate risk mitigation investments: 1) Green Infrastructure (projects that emulate or protect nature in order to ensure clean water supply for commercial and public use); and 2) weather insurance contracts, which provide businesses and utilities with financial relief from droughts and floods that hamper their operations. With 50% of the global population projected to face water scarcity by 2050 (according to the UN), and $10B in economic value destroyed annually by floods, droughts, freezes in the US, these new approaches to risk mitigation are crucial to reducing water demand stresses through a free-market approach to water resource conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to eliminate technical barriers currently hindering seamless data and model integration for hydrology and finance. The Phase I project validated technical feasibility by demonstrating the utility of a semantic web technology to provide end-to-end modeling solutions for quantifying hydro-financial risk. Phase I established that the technology 1) greatly improves the interoperability between massive heterogeneous data sets and models for quantifying hydrologic-financial risk, and 2) enables data and models to be linked through a tamper-proof distributed network. The Phase II project builds on the technological foundation to deploy a production environment for running a suite of models encompassing ecosystem services, hydrology, and actuarial sciences. The project builds foundations for AI-enabled decision support tools. If successful, this research will enable significant reductions in the time and costs associated with modeling the financial value of investment in natural water infrastructure, generating comparisons between a wide range of water projects and financial structures seamlessly and without compromising scientific rigor.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel genetic trait that allows plants to rapidly respond to attacking pathogens. Despite modern agricultural practices and chemistry improvements, almost 40% of all crop production is lost due to pests and pathogens each year; within the U.S. over 25% of soybean production is lost this way. These losses are even more severe in regions where pesticide application is prohibitively expensive for farmers.  This project develops a new technology for use in soybean and other oilseed crops to protect against plant disease.

    The proposed project will develop a broad-spectrum pathogen resistance trait.  While the first generation of transgenic trait technologies conferring herbicide tolerance and insecticidal traits have been readily established for oilseed production across North and South America, further development has faltered due to the complexity of these plant traits. Unfortunately, the proteins that provide the best tolerance to adverse environmental conditions also result in toxic side-effects when produced in healthy plants; consequently, the utility of developing these proteins is limited. Current methods for regulating expression of resistance proteins introduced into plants through genetic engineering are insufficient to regulate toxic proteins/compounds that may have side-effects in other environmental conditions. The proposed project will demonstrate an expression system that responds to signals, common to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, in the early and late stages of the plant immune response to release the production of anti-microbial proteins only in when needed, effectively eliminating the off-target side-effects. The project objectives are to 1) perform field and greenhouse trial of soybean with this technology to ascertain extent of pathogen resistance and yield effects in infected and healthy conditions; 2) optimize the technology for tissue specific (i.e., roots vs. leaves) use in soybean; 3) conduct greenhouse experiments to determine response to pathogen detection in canola, cotton, and potato as candidates for future field trials and commercialization.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need special probes or dyes to detect viruses.

    The proposed project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images from the common 96-well plate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an oral delivery platform that can deliver various drugs to the gastrointestinal tract. The market for novel biologics and oral formulations of currently injectable biologics is increasing rapidly, as is the market for gene therapies, necessitating a versatile oral drug delivery platform. This platform would positively impact society by reducing the need for repeated injections. This system would improve ease of administration of injectables by improving oral availability and the transport to the intestinal cells, and subsequent secretion of the protein into the bloodstream. This would also allow for local delivery of therapeutics for intestinal diseases which currently are hampered by poor mucus penetration and represent a multibillion-dollar market. Successful translation of this technology would benefit pharmaceutical companies, patients, and payers by providing an oral delivery platform for a broad range of therapeutics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of improving systemic expression of a protein from the gastrointestinal tract following oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The role of digestive tract is to breakdown lipids and nucleic acids and it has therefore been very challenging to for gene delivery vehicles to survive and deliver cargo to the intestine. The project advances a new lipid nanoparticle system able to protect the genetic cargo to generate protein expression in intestinal cells later secreted into the bloodstream for systemic circulation. This process converts previously injected protein drugs into an easily administered oral drug. The research objectives are to screen and optimize several of the lipid components as well as the nucleic acid to improve secreted expression of a protein into the blood after oral delivery. This research will screen multiple formulations and cargos in vivo and measure serum protein levels after oral lipid nanoparticle delivery. The anticipated technical results are that the level of secreted protein will improve 10x from the initial formulation, further increasing the scope of potential therapeutic targets for the oral lipid nanoparticle.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of blood clotting and associated bleeding risks in neonatal and pediatric patients as well as vulnerable adult patients. Existing systems put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. Using only a single drop of blood, the proposed non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting for all patients and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by more than 3x. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $1.1 billion annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood. The basis of the technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation. Due to its non-contact feature and low sample volume requirement, this technology can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The goal of this project is to develop and test a system for fast, reliable, and easy-to-use drop-of-blood coagulation analysis under sterile conditions. This goal will be achieved by meeting four objectives: 1) develop the module for automatic sample deployment from standard blood collection tubes; 2) implement environmental control and sample containment (“acoustic cartridge”); 3) assemble prototype devices and develop the control software with improved workflow and a user-friendly interface; and 4) assess prototype reliability, standardize it for coagulation measurements, and conduct initial clinical testing.

    \ Research (SBIR) Phase II project is its potential to lower healthcare costs\
    \ and enhance the quality of life for breast cancer survivors, along with those\
    \ suffering from traumatic injuries, skin ulcers, and other surgical wounds. For\
    \ breast conserving surgery (BCS), which represents the standard of care for early-stage\
    \ breast cancer, the most assured way of achieving satisfactory outcomes is complete\
    \ tumor removal and preservation of breast cosmesis in a single surgery. Unfortunately,\
    \ the rates of BCS-related complications, deformities, and secondary surgeries\
    \ remain high (20-40%), which increases healthcare costs and negatively impacts\
    \ patient quality of life. To address these problems, this project furthers development\
    \ of an in-situ, scaffold-forming collagen designed as a conformable and regenerative\
    \ filler for soft tissue defects and voids. This soft-tissue filler has the potential\
    \ to improve breast surgeons’ ability to provide predictable and pleasing outcomes\
    \ to their patients. Further, the versatility of this collagen polymer means that\
    \ it can be used for a variety of other clinical applications (e.g., vocal fold\
    \ medialization, therapeutic cells, and drug delivery) and to create regenerative\
    \ tissue products for other areas of major unmet clinical need (e.g., cartilage,\
    \ skeletal muscle). \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II\
    \ project seeks to complete the final technical hurdles to commercialize the novel\
    \ collagen polymer referred to above. Recognizing the significance of collagen\
    \ as the body’s primary tissue building material, this patented biomaterial platform\
    \ was designed to be highly purified and to retain collagen’s natural fibril-forming\
    \ (polymerization) capacity. While this technology offers a broad range of customization\
    \ potential, this project focuses on development of an in-situ, scaffold-forming\
    \ collagen to accelerate and improve healing outcomes of complex cavity, tunneling,\
    \ and deep penetrating tissue defects. The collagen is applied as a conformable\
    \ liquid, which rapidly transitions to a fibrillar scaffold with soft tissue consistency.\
    \ Preclinical studies evaluating this product as a breast tissue filler following\
    \ lumpectomy have documented the following: 1) ease of use, 2) conformability\
    \ to patient-specific voids, 3) noninflammatory regenerative healing, and 4) compatibility\
    \ with standard clinical procedures. This SBIR project seeks to achieve key commercialization\
    \ milestones associated with establishing pilot-scale manufacturing and achieving\
    \ relevant product regulatory clearance and approval. Specifically, work will\
    \ include development and validation of scalable processing steps for collagen\
    \ purification, sterilization, and viral inactivation. This project will also\
    \ complete most of the non-clinical bench performance and biocompatibility testing\
    \ necessary for regulatory filings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to reduce the risk of complications and associated costs caused by standard bag valve mask (BVM) resuscitators, which are widely used in emergency resuscitation and airway management. In the United States, about 13.1 million BVMs are used annually. Medical providers frequently deliver unsafe manual ventilation with BVMs, regardless of the qualifications and experience of the provider. Dangerously high pressures, flow rates, and volumes of air flow can result in complications such as gastric insufflation, and less frequently, aspiration pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, barotrauma, volutrauma, and pneumothorax. There is an urgent need for an intervention to improve patient safety during manual ventilation with the resuscitator bag. This project involves the development of a safety device to be used with all standard BVMs on the market to regulate air flow and pressure. The device that will offer safe, affordable, and optimized ventilation while minimizing gastric insufflation.  The technology should have broad applications across the entire care continuum, but especially in emergency and battlefield medicine.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project seeks to further develop and optimize the BVM safety. This effort optimizes the haptic and auditory feedback the provider receives when using the device and optimizes the design and manufacturability of the product. In addition, biocompatibility studies and animal studies of the device in anesthetized pigs and in pigs undergoing cardiac arrest will provide data necessary for FDA clearance. This Phase II work will ensure that patients will receive the most optimal evidence-based treatment and will help establish the safety device as the standard of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy using a novel and proprietary precision gene editing technology. The proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of gene editing by optimizing the precision of editing to correct the disease. This technology can be used to improve and even cure patients of genetic disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a curative therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using a novel and proprietary CRISPR-Cas precision gene editing system. Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases. However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies. This project will develop an engineered anti-CRISPR (ErAcr) protein to eliminate unintended off-target editing. The ErAcr protein will be paired with a novel CRISPR-Cas nuclease and developed into a therapy for SMA> The therapy will be packaged into an adeno-associated viral vector and tested for editing and SMA disease correction in patient-derived cells and in an SMA mouse model. Effective editing will lead to disease correction in both patient cells and mice with no observable off-target editing events.

    The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance clinical outcomes for patients with a traumatic or palliative peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In the U.S., 20 million people suffer from PNIs, with a high prevalence among young individuals and a total economic cost to society in excess of $150 billion per year. Acute PNIs account for more than 500,000 annual surgical procedures in the U.S and frequently result in permanent disability. This project develops a platform technology with the potential to address many types of PNI.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a novel nerve graft/conduit for nerve gap injury repair and a nerve cap.  The project goal is to advance a solution to improve the nerve functional outcome while still reducing the tension across the repair.  It provides a tissue-like matrix that allows aligned nerve growth out of the free nerve ending. The technology is derived from decellularized porcine nerve tissue and maintains native structural and functional proteins, providing an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration. This project conducts in-vivo studies, sterilization demonstrations, and lyophilization. Supply chain security, packaging development, and tooling will be developed in preparation for commercial launch.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a viable and scalable process to manufacture a bamboo-based strand composite for application in low-cost roofing globally.  This project develops a new production process for exterior-grade natural fiber composite building products, derived from a highly renewable resource, bamboo, through public-private partnership.  The resulting roofing product will help protect users from extreme heat by passively cooling and reducing indoor temperatures. In addition, this solution can be used to create value-added energy-efficient building products from highly renewable natural fiber waste. The innovation holds immense potential to replace harmful and hazardous materials, including asbestos, in many regions of the world, store captured carbon into long-lifecycle products, and reduce heating and cooling energy use.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will: (i) refine the design of the 3D panel geometry used to make commercial-size panels with improved load-carrying capacity and constructability; (ii) improve the bamboo-stranding process, evaluate a bio-based adhesive system, impart fire-retardance, enhance panel durability, manufacture panels using the new geometry, and evaluate performance; and (iii) demonstrate and evaluate panel use as a roofing material through field tests and the versatility of the corrugated panel in interior and exterior energy-efficient building products. This research will advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing challenges of long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including moisture resistance, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide environmentally friendly, self-cleaning coating technologies. Fluorinated materials, known as forever materials, have been widely used due to their excellent self-cleaning properties, but the detrimental environmental impacts resulting from these coatings motivate the introduction of environmentally friendly solutions. This project plans to create a new technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties, and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g., excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion) while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and 3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the technology into  relevant applications. The anticipated results include successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace, to name a few.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is utilizing thermal energy management to simultaneously improve the affordability, comfort, and safety of buildings, with an initial focus on meeting urgent market demand for non-combustible building insulation.  This project will focus on developing a lightweight, easy-to-install, non-combustible insulation product which is also eco-friendly and non-toxic.  Structure fires represent 37% of all fires in the US. These fires caused $12.3 billion in property damage and 80% of civilian fire deaths.  Wildfires in the Western US, where >$220 billion in residential construction is in “extreme” wildfire-prone areas, add to the urgency of this situation.  Mineral wool is the only non-combustible insulation product available today but requires personal protective equipment for installation and was recently classified as carcinogenic.  Fully non-combustible building insulation is a high growth market, and the broader market for all types of non-flammable insulation represents a significant opportunity.  This Phase II project seeks to cost-effectively increase the supply of energy-efficient, non-combustible buildings for both new and retrofit construction, while also addressing high-temperature industrial markets which have the most intensive energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up a novel nanocomposite insulation product using a proprietary foaming process for inorganic aerogel-based insulation that minimizes shrinkage (thus maximizing porosity for insulation performance and minimizing material and processing cost). This approach leverages readily available materials such as clay and silica, as well as potentially renewable cellulose biomass, to produce an environmentally friendly, high performance insulation product for non-combustible buildings which is easy to install, lightweight, and non-toxic.  Successfully scaling this approach on existing manufacturing equipment may solve a significant materials research challenge, creating organic-inorganic nanocomposites for thermal insulation with a competitive cost / performance ratio versus incumbent products such as fiberglass, mineral wool, and plastic foams.  The Phase II project may result in the first industrially-engineered composite material for thermal insulation which is fully non-combustible.  The integration of flexible polymers and radiation blocking additives would also enable use for high-temperature industrial pipe insulation, a critical energy-saving application where most existing products have significant limitations due to radiation loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  II project is to improve disease research and drug discovery. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most impactful and vital tools of biological structure analysis today.  The proposed project improves the current methods to achieve better accuracy and productivity, with faster user training.

    The proposed project improves imaging by cryo-EM. The images currently generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy and thus requires extensive processing to build recognizable structures (proteins and others). Single-particle cryo-EM is a method that produces images of individual particles and can potentially analyze biological structures at the single-molecule level.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques to mitigate the issues.  AI/ML algorithms can automate the workflow, facilitating quality data and the development of 3D models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling (unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels) of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation. This project seeks to develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed. This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to ship hulls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas. The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous, electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls. This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial transport and Naval vessels can be addressed.  The project will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the current lack of useful, realistic feedback in commercially available bionic prosthetic devices. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide closed loop control through sensory feedback. Without this type feedback, prosthesis users tend to avoid manipulating certain objects because they run the risk of handling them incorrectly or destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research seeks to develop a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. The expected outcomes of this research are: a controller that can regulate both intensity and quality sensation and a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for day-to-day manipulation tasks. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million upper limb amputees worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enhance a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator, by integrating a control system that will be able to regulate both intensity and quality of sensation. The design and controller of this stimulator are unique.  The stimulator will integrate existing prosthetic hand systems. The sensation controller will modulate stimulation parameters to compensate for changes in measured resistance between the electrode-skin interface, thus reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The sensation controller will also maintain a consistent quality of sensation throughout usage. Upon completion of the Phase II project, the prosthetic technology will be a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to commercialize a novel technology that enables compact, efficient, silent, reliable, and fuel-flexible power generation. Existing power solutions can lack endurance, reliability, and portability and often generate harmful emissions; or they are prohibitively expensive or incompatible with existing fuels and distribution infrastructure.  The power generation platform developed in this project has the potential to be a key enabling technology for the future rapid growth of commercial drone applications, which currently are often limited by the performance of lithium ion batteries. Drones are expected to make an impact across numerous industries including transport and delivery, power and utilities, telecommunications, and remote sensing. Additionally, this power generation technology can benefit industrial internet of things applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel power source that is easily portable and is compatible with existing fuel infrastructure. This project develops a system that converts most fuels to electricity via light; combustion heats a nanophotonic material to incandescence and the resulting light drives photovoltaic cells. The nanophotonic material is engineered to be spectrally matched to the photovoltaic cells, enabling efficient conversion. This technology can increase the endurance of drones or other systems up to ten times over batteries alone. This work is focused on cost reduction through new material development. The specific research objectives are to demonstrate a low-cost and scalable process for the nanophotonic material and photovoltaic cell while maintaining high performance, and then integrate and pilot the low cost system. Successful completion of these objectives will enable this technology to translate to drone applications with a compelling need for long-lasting portable power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a scalable carbon nanotube (CNT) production process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of the production process. This project will support domestic supply chains for CNT materials at potentially disruptively low cost-levels. There is market need for low cost CNTs to companies where replacement of existing additives with CNTs can lead to improved products at equivalent or lower cost. Two examples of this are in battery additives or tire additives, where CNTs can replace lower quality carbon black materials to break traditional materials trade-offs such as energy vs power density (batteries) or fuel efficiency vs lifetime (tires).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, sustainable electrochemical Carbon Nanotube (CNT) production technology, which uses CO2 and electricity to produce high quality CNT products that meet and exceed the quality metrics of today's market products, while feasibly offering a disruptively lower priced CNT product.  This project leverages experience in electrochemistry and carbon nanomaterials synthesis to develop rapidly scalable electrode architectures and preparation processes to fabricate such electrode architectures that enable the production of CNTs at cost structures that are truly disruptive in the marketplace and enable rapid commercialization.  To further complement these technical efforts, this project optimizes post-growth CNT processing to better align products for customer integration and utilization.  Finally, this work will demonstrate the commercial viability of the approach and a scaling pathway for the materials platform.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable wider adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across industries such as real estate, agriculture, construction, energy, entertainment, oil & gas, and journalism.  The project develops advanced UAV camera systems with seamless 360-degree imaging capabilities to increase flight time and the imaging capability. End users benefit from reduced labor demands and real-time high-fidelity images of remote areas otherwise inaccessible. Industrial inspections, crop management, field surveying, and site security are most often conducted by deploying humans into the field - often creating labor bottlenecks and potentially dangerous situations. Adoption of UAVs for these applications can be limited by image processing that consumes too much power for UAV use, delayed image presentation affecting navigation capabilities, or image artifacts that obscure the details pertinent to market needs.  These limitations can all be overcome with the camera technologies developed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a lightweight, parallax-free, 360-degree panoramic camera system with an innovative optical design based on a polyhedron-shaped configuration of adjacent cameras. Each camera's field of view closely abuts but does not overlap with the next, enabling seamless and computationally simplistic capture of images from 360-degree views, while limiting blind regions and lost content between cameras. This approach eliminates the stitching errors and image distortion associated with wide angle lenses and multi-camera systems, and reduces the computational demand for 360-degree image capture. As a result, low energy edge-computing presents images in real time with minimal impact on flight time or energy use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications. Furthermore, this project advances system designs optimized for UAV weight and size, as well as improved concepts for kinematic space frames, in which the cameras can be integrated to form robust multi-camera systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the environment with cleaner diesel engine exhaust. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.  This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.

    The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of an aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery that is a replacement for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries in stationary energy storage applications.  This battery has a nonflammable, environmentally-friendly, water-based electrolyte and does not utilize cobalt or nickel, reducing reliance on critical materials and helping to diversify battery material supply chains.  The battery chemistry combines the high safety and low cost associated with zinc-based batteries with the long life of lithium-ion batteries.  This aqueous battery may help to advance the adoption of beneficial energy technologies such as intermittent renewables and electric vehicles.  The battery utilizes zinc that can be sourced domestically and does not introduce a dependency on foreign sources, promoting both national security and the creation of US-based jobs.  The battery is also fully recyclable using existing methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the aqueous lithium and zinc ion battery technology by focusing on optimization of individual battery components to improve cycle life and power as well as scale up from pouch cells to larger-format prismatic cells.  The research will include refining the intercalation electrode design to increase capacity retention during long life cycling, developing the zinc electrode design to suppress zinc dendrite growth, improving separator functionality to maintain high-rate capabilities and increase cycle life, and developing an electrolyte designed to stabilize zinc while also allowing for faster reactivity with the zinc and lithium ions.  Larger format cells with optimized components will be built and tested to evaluate scaled real-world performance metrics compared to Lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries traditionally used in stationary energy storage applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance energy sustainability, especially regarding estimation, understanding, and optimization of real-time grid carbon emissions. Decarbonizing the grid means reducing its carbon emissions by decreasing the emissions per unit of electricity generated. In-depth, accurate knowledge of real-time grid emissions will facilitate various grid decarbonization use cases and applications ranging from corporate carbon accounting, carbon-aware energy management, and new emission tracking standards to future electricity and carbon market design. More broadly, the prposed platform may demonstrate that achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reductions via co-optimization for costs and carbon is possible and provide a commercially viable, scalable path for policy makers, regulators, and corporations to meet their ambitious sustainability commitments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop novel and practical approaches to estimate, learn, and optimize real-time grid emissions. The Phase II project will optimize carbon estimation and forecast models, develop decision-making algorithms, implement the proposed methods as software, and validate the software platform through pilots. The team seeks to will build a user-friendly, cloud-based software platform with multiple applications that will enable climate regulators and sustainability directors to meet their public commitments and stay compliant with new regulations. Integrating real-time carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management is a critical challenge. Little is known about real-time carbon signals from the grid and the proposed project aims to demystify grid emissions to enable accurate, actionable, and transparent carbon tracking, reporting, and management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a breakthrough power source for small electronic devices that will move the reality of smart cities and smart rural areas closer to the vision. The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the 'Internet-of-Things' vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures.

    The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of "things" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to more completely understand the real world through a perfect virtual copy. This SBIR Phase II project makes it possible to create virtual reproductions of real cities that not only show how the world looks, but reproduce every object and every detail perfectly, allowing users to interact with it. These virtual copies make it possible to quickly and effectively train soldiers and first responders, train autonomous ground and flying vehicles, place new construction into a dense city, simulate the effects of catastrophic weather, and explore imaginary scenarios through games. Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address the lack of advanced maps of shallow water zones, or littoral zones, crucial to global ecology and economy.  An estimated 70% of the world's littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands with scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely.  Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence for amphibious landings and accurate assessment of the environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development. The resulting geospatial products will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite-derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different physical parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval to form complementary measurements. Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.  Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metaocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation; and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.  The shallow seafloor is a dynamic and poorly understood domain due to the complexity of the environment and navigational dangers of accessing unknown waters. The project's goal is to create a remotely produced, automated, self-validating satellite-based shallow seafloor mapping system by implementing artificial intelligence, advanced remote sensing and computer science algorithms and ongoing collection of earth observation imagery to globally produce 10-30 m resolution bathymetry elevation models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the introduction of non-flammable, easy-to-manufacture solid battery electrolytes that are also compatible with lithium metal. The cell architecture seeks to ensure safety while enabling a significant improvement in the energy density.  The teams also seeks to lower the costs of the lithium-ion batteries by eliminating extrinsic costs associated with thermal management and explosion containment.  Safe, easy-to-manufacture electrolytes may alter the rate of electrification of the global economy. The next generation of battery powered medical devices, a large proportion of which are manufactured in the United States, may also benefit from the adoption of the new solid electrolyte. In addition, the proposed composite solid electrolyte aims to enable new cell architectures with significantly higher energy densities than what has been possible in liquid electrolyte systems to date.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a non-flammable, high-conductivity composite, solid-state battery electrolytes that are compatible with mixed metal oxide cathode chemistries and cell manufacturing processes. The morphology of the composite electrolyte is such that it offsets disadvantages present in polymer electrolytes, as well as inorganic sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes, when they are used as monolithic materials. The unique heterostructures of the proposed solid electrolytes advance the current state-of-the-art by enabling faster diffusion of lithium ions through multiple pathways, while mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte's nonflammable nature makes it a potential replacement for conventional liquid electrolytes in reducing fire hazards and reducing the costs of reqired thermal protection systems in lithium-ion batteries. The compatibility with lithium metal presents a unique opportunity for improvement in the energy density over currently used silicon-graphite anodes, that translates to a lower cost per unit of stored energy ($/kWh). An additional advantage is that these batteries do not require special handling and they are compatible with both spiral wound and planar battery form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to facilitate access to banking services through use of blockchain/distributed ledger technology, even with limited internet access. The proposed technology can make transfers more affordable and convenient. Digitizing transfers increases speed, reduces exchange and transfer fees, and lowers the risk associated with carrying cash.  This proposed technology enables access for the 13 million people currently underserved by the financial industry.  If successful, this technology could improve efficiency and resilience of transfers worldwide. The project's anticipated results include 60% cost reduction compared to traditional transfer systems, <30 second transaction completions, and an anticipated 0% fraud rate.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research and develop a blockchain-based solution to store, send, and make transfers without a smartphone or internet. The proposed core technology includes a blockchain back-end that powers an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) front-end, allowing mobile devices to securely send and receive data without an internet connection. This project’s intellectual merit lies in (1) developing the first-of-its-kind blockchain-based system for international transactions with access even in low bandwidth/no bandwidth environments; (2) creating a digital identity protocol that is distributed, accessible offline, and usable by any entity without exposing personally identifiable information (PII); and (3) developing the first machine learning-based microlending algorithms using offline behaviors to predict, prompt, and automate actions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes providing a high-throughput system for recycling critical metals like cobalt to reduce the conventional energy-intensive mining and refining processes used to produce materials for manufacturing today. Most importantly, this project will help secure a supply of critical materials, reducing the United States’ reliance on foreign supply chains and guaranteeing a secondary source of battery materials. A new, domestic supply will also reduce the social and human health impacts associated with artisanal mining, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to (1) validate novel electro-extraction nanotechnology based separations technology in the battery recycling and cobalt mining space, and (2) validate a new, value-added product (a battery cathode precursor material) for this rapidly growing market, rendering the conventional refining stages unnecessary.   The proposed electroextraction process utilizes flow-through water electrolysis to produce high local concentrations of hydroxide to precipitate transition metals as metal hydroxides.  This understanding will allow tuning the device operating conditions for metal or mixed-metal specific precipitation, for example, the precipitation of Ni-Mn-Co hydroxides at battery stoichiometries or highly selective precipitation of individual metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address fire and explosion safety hazards associated with lithium ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage technologies. Fueled by growth in the energy storage and electric vehicle industries, the Li-ion battery market is expected to grow to a size of several hundred billion dollars by 2025. Future viability of these clean energy technologies are dependent on Li-ion battery technology. However, Li-ion batteries occasionally catastrophically fail, posing thermal hazards as serious as fires and explosions.  The proposed technology has the potential to be an effective, low cost solution and accelerating adoption of transformative clean energy technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the safety of Li-ion bateries. Under certain scenarios, Li-ion batteries can fail, resulting in an exothermic release of flammable and toxic gases. For applications including large multi-cell battery systems in energy storage and vehicle use, the risk of thermal runaway can result in catastrophic fires, explosions and toxic gas release that can damage nearby infrastructure and cause injury or death. Thermal runaway poses significant challenges for available suppression and mitigation systems because the hazardous gas release can continue despite suppression of the incipient fire. The proposed thermal runaway protection and suppression technology addresses the source of the hazards by exploiting a series of novel physio-chemical processes to reduce flammable and toxic gas species concentrations released during a thermal runaway event.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will significantly lower the initial cost of residential and commercial ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems used in space heating and cooling applications. GSHPs are inherently more energy efficient than most heating and cooling technologies. This technology will accelerate electrification of the US economy, lessen the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels, reduce peak electricity demand, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. GSHPs operate quietly and reliably, provide humidity control, and can provide both heating and cooling, greatly increasing the comfort of building environments and quality of life. GSHPs can also reduce and levelize utility bills in low-income housing and enhance the ability to provide energy assistance programs to those in need.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further develop a novel technology that will overcome barriers in the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The project’s chief technical objectives are to improve tools and knowhow relating to the application of the proposed novel in-ground heat exchanger technology and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this technology in real-world applications in targeted geographical markets. Specifically, the project will further refine the computational modeling tools used to size heat exchanger systems; and develop and integrate sophisticated geospatial data sets that these models will use/ This will result in more accurate and more rapid heat exchanger sizing on a site-specific basis. Next, the project will validate these tools through extended testing and data collection on a prototype system installed on a home system. Finally, this project will apply these tools during the deployment of three commercial systems in targeted geographic markets and collect additional data regarding their performance over time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project improves inventory management.  An estimated $818 billion is lost annually due to incomplete knowledge of a company’s inventory.  The problem occurs because of the absence of a label at manufacturing that survives through the supply chain (retail, logistics, and end user). Currently, traditional supply chain management forces a company to add at least one new tag at each step. This project will reduce the number of tags per product, exponentially decrease waste, increase supply chain efficiency, and prevent knockoffs or counterfeits from being added to the supply chain. All of this will help businesses run more effectively, better serve customers, and enable consumers to gain detailed knowledge of their purchases.

    The intellectual merit of this project is development of the first commercially viable, cradle-to-grave inventory tag through optimization and scalability tasks. The innovation is a chipless inventory tag with a unique serial number for every product to provide the cradle-to-grave functionality. The underlying Material Adjusted Signature Tag (MAST) technology uses printable materials to create a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. The MAST tags will enable direct printing or application of a tag onto a product, allowing an efficient way to reliably identify, track, and attribute data to a product throughout its life. This project will improve the tag’s data potential, optimize manufacturability, and achieve greater readability. Beyond optimization and scalability milestones, this project will test the tags, readers, and manufacturing equipment in relevant environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of automatically refocusing reading glasses for wide adoption by the two billion people with presbyopia, a common form of vision loss with age that prevents focusing on nearby objects. Current presbyopia corrections, such as reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses, are unwieldy or unnatural solutions that fail to perfectly replace healthy vision. An automatically refocusing system will provide an attractive alternative by restoring natural vision, such that objects are brought into focus according to where the user looks. With a lightweight and robust implementation for all-day use, such a system will be poised for wide translation to address a ubiquitous cause of decreased productivity and quality of life for billions worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop key technologies leading to the miniaturization of the automatically refocusing glasses. Existing systems address only the highest performance implementations of full 3D gaze estimation for demanding applications like VR or AR, and they are too power-hungry and large for automatically refocusing reading glasses. This project will develop a customized hardware and software system for novel depth-estimation specific to this application. The project will explore the trade space of weight, power consumption, and form factor to develop an optimal parameter set.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance a novel, reusable, intermittent, urinary catheterization system from a functional prototype to the final production-equivalent device. By progressing the system through additional design improvements and FDA submission, the goal of this project is to enable the product to reach the hands of individuals who require intermittent catheters to urinate. Current intermittent urinary catheter use is fraught with complications including frequent urinary tract infections, expensive supplies, and large material footprints, as well as the generation of a significant amount of plastic waste. This project seeks to improve the current catheter landscape by allowing for commercialization of a reusable catheter system that will reduce contact contamination during insertion, reduce plastic waste, and enable widespread use of high-quality urinary catheters by decreasing the per-use cost. Through these improvements, healthcare costs associated with intermittent catheterization can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, based on frequent interactions with individuals who catheterize and suffer from impaired dexterity, the design of the system will incorporate the needs and ideas of people who are often ignored during innovation within the current catheterization space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will finalize the design of a novel, reusable, intermittent urinary catheterization system and portable reprocessing device as well as advance the system towards commercialization. Intermittent urinary catheterization is a technologically static field that has not changed significantly since the 1970s, with minimal improvements in urinary tract infection risk, supply cost, and environmental waste reduction. While the associated SBIR Phase I project established proof-of-concept catheter reprocessing, the Phase II project will include optimization and more advanced microbiologic efficacy testing. This assessment will focus on specifically addressing concerns regarding lubrication and compactness brought up during SBIR Phase I customer discovery activities, as well as multiple reuse reprocessing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase access to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Over 554,000 kidney failure patients in the US require some form of dialysis each year but only 58,000 receive PD, despite its lower cost of care. Despite the many benefits and advantages of PD compared to in-center dialysis, adoption is limited due to the risk of peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneal membrane. Peritonitis occurs in nearly 30% of PD patients each year and is responsible for the death of 1 out of every 6 patients who receive PD. The proposed device significantly and broadly reduces the risk of peritonitis, resulting in nearly $2 billion in Medicare savings and improved clinical outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop a medical device that internally disinfects catheter tubes in a closed system. This innovative disinfection method is designed to prevent microbial infection threats during peritoneal dialysis. The aim will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disinfection prototype, including evaluations of its ease of use. The technology will be designed to meet medical device design and safety standards. The project will perform optimization studies, develop cGMP-ready manufacturing processes, and develop an advanced prototype.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and commercialize an ocular gene therapy to reverse the effects of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting over 11 million Americans today and representing the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the United States. The proposed treatment has the potential to preserve independence, economic stability, and quality of life of those affected by AMD and reduce US healthcare costs with just a single treatment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project technical plan will optimize the formulation, dose, and route of administration of an investigational therapy in a large animal model. The project will first develop gene therapy formulations with various vehicles. The formulations’ efficiency in retinal tissues with an injection into the eye will be assessed with preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses. Toxicology studies will be performed to assess safety and efficacy of the novel formulation and the injection route at various doses over 3 months. Subsequently, the project will assess risk in manufacturing the gene delivery vehicles to ensure that high concentrations can be manufactured for future clinical use.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in transforming a ubiquitous source of water pollution into a renewable source of fertilizer, while facilitating onsite treatment and reuse of recycled greywater. This technological solution is intended to conserve precious drinking water supplies and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources for both wastewater treatment and fertilizer production. Rather than combining all domestic wastewater into one dilute stream, this project separates and recycles the largest source of nutrient pollution: toilet waste. Source-separating bathroom fixtures (including waterless urinals, urine-diverting toilets, and vacuum-flush toilets) direct the waste through dedicated plumbing to a compact building-scale processor, which converts it into a purified liquid fertilizer. This technology may have immediate utility in sensitive watersheds where regulations require landowners to remove nitrogen from wastewater, and in urban settings where municipalities are subsidizing or mandating distributed wastewater treatment because their central wastewater treatment facilities have reached or exceeded their design capacity. The technology may create jobs in installation and service, reduce loads on wastewater treatment plants, restore waterways, and yield clean, domestically-produced fertilizer for use in agriculture.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on developing a building-scale, high-strength, wastewater treatment system paired with source-separating bathroom fixtures to result in a resource recovery system. Nutrients are recovered from the influent wastewater through a four-stage treatment train that includes: (1) acidification to minimize pipe occlusion, (2) freeze concentration to reduce volume, (3) pasteurization to destroy pathogens, and (4) filtration to reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. The objective of this research project is to develop this technology to the point where it can be installed in a building and is capable of capturing greater than 90% of nutrients from 600 liters of wastewater per day with minimal energy inputs. This goal will require increasing the working volume of the current freeze concentrator, optimizing the energy usage of each element in the treatment train, packaging each element so that they are durable, readily installable, and easily maintained, and developing a fully automated control system. Each element of the treatment train will be tested individually to demonstrate that a consistent, concentrated, sanitized fertilizer can be produced from high-strength wastewater while decreasing building water demand.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for a healthy, sustainable built environment. Stringent environmental protection policies are presenting the building industry with challenges in reducing environmental impacts. High performing windows could play an role in reducing energy use and pollutant emissions. Creating a window system that reduces building energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may have broad societal, economic, and commercial impacts. The proposed biochromic windows can serve as an alternative, energy efficient retrofit and help meet net zero energy, net zero carbon buildings. Their multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits include high energy efficiency, improved air quality, carbon capture, and renewable energy production. Energy efficient window retrofitting accounts for over 60% of the global window market share. In 2021, the global window market grew to $10 billion for replacement and renovation and $6 billion for new construction with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. This energy efficient, carbon sink technology may result in 20~30% energy savings and carbon reductions. The good air quality further benefits occupant health and well-being, making the building more appealing to occupants, industry professionals, and stakeholders.

    The key technical innovation of the biochromic window is to integrate biological cells within a window assembly for commercial building retrofitting applications. As a primary building enclosure system mediating between indoor and outdoor environments, the biochromic window offers improved insulation, dynamic shading efficacy, daylight penetration, views to outside, carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation, and biomass production, all of which are attributes of improved building energy efficiency, good indoor air quality, beneficial carbon sequestration, novel biofuel production, and user satisfaction. The primary project objectives are to: 1) prototype of a biochromic window, integrated with an intelligent control system to enable the maximum performance; 2) conduct performance testing and obtain performance certificates; and 3) scale-up mass production manufacturing and carry out technology demonstrations at early adopter’s buildings. Project outcomes seek to save building energy consumption in heating, cooling, and artificial lighting load while producing on-site renewable energy and sequestrating CO2. The biochromic windows, coupled with an intelligent control system, further enhance economic and environmental performance depending on solar intensity and carbon concentration. The view-out area within the biochromic window admits year round daylighting. Proximity to green nature is expected to provide aesthetic quality and emotional comfort for user satisfactions.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to help manage environmental change in coastal cities. Currently, a gap exists in the coastal infrastructure community for an effective solution that supports ecological health and community-based co-benefits over traditional gray infrastructure, such as seawalls, berms, or structured fill. This project addresses that gap through a novel full-scale experimental implementation of a reliable and durable network of floating biomass-based modules for coastal protection. The proposed project develops a dynamic, detail-oriented scientific approach and technical modeling. This project will demonstrate how an interconnected, anchored network of vegetated biomass modules can dampen wave energy, absorb water pollutants, and create an engaging community space for coastal cities.

    The technical innovations of the proposed SBIR Phase II project are: (A) a new material engineering approach for seaworthy floating modules based on biomass and living plants, anchored in a hexagonal array and interconnected; (B) a full numerical predictive modeling suite to simulate biogeochemical effects, fluid dynamic network effects, and hydrodynamic effects of large such networks of modules; and (C) a fully functional prototype network to study physical behavior and effects. This project consists of five separate experimental objectives: (1) extensive unit prototyping, redesign and monitoring to assess manufacturer material and biological behavior over time, (2) ecological monitoring of individual unit and network impacts leading to the development of a predictive biogeochemical model, (3) translation of physical wave tank lab results into a predictive coastal environment simulation model, (4) hydrodynamic analysis of a full-scale experimental network prototype, and (5) development of technical methods for production and deployment at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project benefitd the 70 million people struggling with gait disorders in the US. Gait analysis monitors how individuals walk to predict or prevent injuries and track rehabilitation progress. Due to the potentially high equipment costs, space requirements, and required technical expertise to collect and interpret results, detailed gait analyses are limited to a few centers and mainly used for surgical decision-making.  This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for gait analysis at roughly 70% less than typical costs, as well as offering reduced set-up time and improved workflow efficiency.

    The proposed project will address the existing technological and commercial barriers that make gait analysis an exclusive clinical tool restricted to only 300 gait labs across the country.  This project will develop a cost-effective markerless motion 3D-tracking system. Technical activities include: (1) increase the motion database to a diverse population, including children and patients with mobility impairments; (2) improve the computer vision algorithms to account for multiple individuals within the camera system’s field of view; (3) integrate EMG and Force Plates; (4) implement skeletal geometry estimation from computed tomography; (5) develop a self-calibration system that can operate with HD low cost cameras; and (5) improve accuracy and usability substantially to reduce the expertise required for computational gait analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve the use of water for the oil and gas (O&G) industry, especially during hydraulic fracturing, transforming the industry into a producer of fresh water and changing produced water from its current status as a waste product to a commodity. The proposed technology creates two reusable products: purified water and heavy brine. In addition to the high cost, disposal of produced water through deep injection wells has recently been linked to seismic activity and may impact groundwater quality, prompting policy solutions.  The O&G industry competes with other water uses, especially in US arid regions where significant O&G production occurs. Produced water, contaminated with salts, hydrocarbons, and metals, is generated each year through O&G production, costing $37B to manage in the U.S. Current demand for global fresh water resources for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes is increasing, primarily due to reduction of water supplies in areas affected by drought, climate change, population growth, and expanding industries, as well as degradation of water quality due to contaminants from industry, flooding, or runoff.  The proposed project will provide a new treatment for water used in O&G production, creating a renewable source of fresh water from otherwise unusable wastewater or impacted water sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance the development of an innovative thermal distillation treatment system for produced water generated during O&G production. Current treatment technologies, like reverse osmosis, cannot handle the high-total dissolved solids (TDS) content of most produced water, and thus only a small portion may be reused currently. Disposal is generally through permitted deep injection wells, with water transportation typically serving as the largest disposal cost component. The proposed system accomplishes the entire thermal distillation process in one piece of equipment - a technological advance over state-of-practice thermal distillation units requiring separate energy sources, heat transfer, distillation, separation, and condensation units. It reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, and it uses less energy in operation.  The system can be set up on-site at the well, eliminating the need to transport produced water off-site for disposal. The proposed treatment process yields two reusable products: (1) purified water, which may be sold for use at the well site, sold for agriculture/industrial uses, or discharged to surface waters; and (2) heavy brine, which may be sold as a drilling fluid.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve detection and enable prediction of implantable device failure. The first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain’s ventricles. Hydrocephalus is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail at alarming rates (40% within the 1st year of use), leading first to nonspecific symptoms such as headaches and blurred vision and then to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. The proposed sensor module can be integrated with already-commercialized shunt systems and may allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health, ultimately improving clinical outcomes while reducing overall treatment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the integration of various microsensors to generate a diagnostic data set for data analytics. This data set will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on CSF dynamics over time. The system would include several first-to-market capabilities, including chronic repeated measurement of CSF dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and dissemination. The smart shunt system will enable remote, on-demand monitoring of shunt status, giving physicians the data necessary for timely diagnosis and prediction of shunt failure. At-home electronic shunt monitoring will allow physicians to quantitatively and proactively manage patients’ disease in real-time, and thereby improve their quality of life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will lead to the development of engineered neutralizing antibodies for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that can be used as therapeutic agents to diminish the severity of a COVID-19 infection and decrease the chances of hospitalization and progressive disease. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate it is necessary to increase collective preparedness by generating a wide collection of neutralizing antibodies that individually provide coverage for a range of variants (Delta, Beta, Omicron). These antibodies, when administered as an antibody cocktail, may offer broad protection over a diverse population of variants. This project’s approach generates neutralizing antibodies that are specifically engineered to bind to different regions of the spike protein thereby increasing the probability that one or more of the engineered antibodies will be effective against future mutated versions of the virus. The proposed combination of high-throughput screening, next-generation-sequencing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based antibody design allows systematic exploration of vast ranges of antibody sequences. This approach also has the benefit of engineering antibodies that are more potent, easier to administer, more stable under challenging environmental conditions, and less costly to manufacture, leading to therapeutics that can be more readily distributed to low-income countries.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to enable AI and machine learning antibody engineering approaches by providing needed antibody sequence mutation binding data. Currently available antibody datasets number in the thousands of datapoints and the team proposes to generate datasets that number in the tens of millions. The project will also be generating both positive and negative antibody binding data, potentially leading to higher performing learned antibody binding models. This project seeks to test the hypothesis that synthetic antibodies can be the equal of, or better than, naturally occurring antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This approach could potentially develop a wide range of antibody variations. The application of this AI-based antibody engineering will be focused on discovering a large array of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple, different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the combination of yeast-display, high-throughput fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and next generation sequencing. Combining these high-throughput data generation workflows with the latest deep neural networks may lead to a new methodology that can efficiently discover high performing antibodies for the current pandemic and those in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce injuries and costs due to overexertion and heat strain in firefighting through a real-time, biometric monitoring system and accompanying analysis tools. This system collects each firefighter's vital signs and sends the data to authorized commanders for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, commanders can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Almost 60% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year, and associated costs total over $7 billion annually.  The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve other first responders, such as military personnel, industrial workers, and others with occupational risk.

    The proposed project will improve the occupational safety of first responders through the research and development of the following components:  1) An improved biometric collection wearable; 2) software used by the biometric monitoring system; 3) a location-monitoring tool; 4) algorithms to estimate sleep quality, fatigue, and detect symptoms for certain diseases, and improve exertion and core-body temperature estimates. 5) network improvement solutions allowing first responders in remote areas to utilize biometric monitoring tools. All five objectives will consist of multiple pilot studies with ongoing research and development that will incorporate crucial feedback from end-users. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for partnering fire and emergency services.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

The incoming class of preschoolers have increasingly variable levels of development and skills than ever before, and educators need to assess their need and help them to catch up academically. The industry leading tools in early childhood assessment rely solely on observation-based assessment, in which teachers make judgments about a child’s performance based on observations made in the classroom. Observation-based measures have limitations, including time burden, teacher bias, and variability in scoring due to differences in teacher education and training. Observational assessment is especially challenging in the remote context, since teachers were not able to physically monitor children’s development. Even when children are back in the classroom, face masks may shield some of the more subtle cues around learning and development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to ensure an accurate assessment of child development, so that teachers can leverage the data for tailored instruction to help children catch up from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Child assessments are typically observational or direct. This Phase II project collects both observational and direct data, providing an opportunity to compare the data and help teachers understand areas where there may be assessment error due to teacher bias or other factors. At the end of Phase II, it is anticipated that teachers will have access to a self-led teacher training and reliability certification, which may help to ensure a more consistent assessment experience in the classroom. Moreover, educational programs will have access to an assessment quality monitoring dashboard that seeks to highlight differences between observation and game-based assessment scores and provide a path towards reconciliation. Educational programs may be able to customize this technology to fit the needs of English language learners, who are often subject to assessor bias. Finally, teachers may be able to leverage the game-based assessments to understand both academic and “soft” skill development. Overall, the technology may\provide teachers with a robust child assessment system that helps them to accurately and efficiently assess whole child development.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the reduction of food waste and improved nutrition. Each year, more than 30% of fresh produce is wasted. The value of this wasted produce is estimated at more than $60 billion globally. This project’s main goal is to extend the shelf life of perishable foods with an edible coating that regulates the rate of both transpiration to slow moisture loss and respiration to delay ripening. The project aims to enable produce growers and distributors to preserve the freshness and quality of fruits and vegetables. Consumers could benefit by having access to fresher, tastier, and more appealing produce. This technology may also promote healthier food choices, especially in currently underserved food deserts. Packers would benefit by being able to offer a high-quality product that will last longer and that can better withstand the rigors of various types of transport. Extended shelf life also extends the market reach of U.S. exports in global markets.

    The core innovation underlying this project is the creation of stable Zein colloids that employ only edible, plant-based ingredients, are non-flammable, non-corrosive, and meet most global food regulations. These colloids will be initially developed as coatings for fresh whole or minimally processed foods, root crops, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.  The coating will not impede the delivery of nutrients, flavors, and other functional ingredients that make foods appealing, improve their quality, and encourage consumption.  The technology will also reduce food spoilage and improving food safety. Experimental work will be focused on further improving the stability of Zein dispersions and demonstrating the ability to adjust the film properties (water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide permeances) to respond to the physiology of a broad range of crops. This technology will also be piloted at various packing plants to evaluate its operational fitness with existing operations. This research will also enable related applications, such as for compostable coatings on food packaging and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical coatings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the novel scientific knowledge gained by understanding the effects of high electrostatic fields on composite dielectrics, the translation of experimental materials to robust and high performance HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators, and, more generally, the impact of HASEL actuation technology within real-world applications. This knowledge contributes to many highly interdisciplinary fields of science, ranging from electrostatics, materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The advancements of HASEL actuators achieved during this project may have broad impacts on commercial, research, education, and defense sectors. These actuators may be an enabling component for a variety of industries including automation, automotive, medical devices, robotics, and defense applications. Key features of HASEL actuators include: analog motion, mechanical compliance, high speed, high strain, silent operation, customization, and self-sensing. By bringing forward actuator technologies, industries may adopt robotic technologies, strengthening the economic competitive advantage of these industries. The team will continue to leverage academic partnerships to contribute to and train a highly capable technical workforce of scientists and engineers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the performance of HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators. HASEL actuators harness electrostatic forces to drive shape-change in a soft hydraulic structure, providing a variety of muscle-like actuation modes and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. HASEL actuators address critical problems in existing soft actuator technologies. For example, soft pneumatic actuators must be tethered to a system of valves and pumps for high performance actuation, whereas HASEL actuators are electrically controlled and can be operated with battery-powered portable power supplies. The team will develop and validate approaches to advance the performance and ease of use of HASEL actuators. These advances of the technology will be realized through material optimization, fabrication improvements, and a more fundamental understanding of solid-liquid composite dielectric structures under high electrostatic fields. Performance improvements will be applied to actuators well-suited for industrial, consumer, defense, and experimental applications.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a platform technology for creating rapid virus diagnostics that directly recognizes the virus surface protein pattern from a patient sample and generates accurate results within minutes. Current standards for high-fidelity viral pathogen diagnostics require complex instruments, technical expertise to run the instruments, and  hours to produce and interpret results. The proposed platform creates a virus-specific biosensor that selectively binds to the target virus and produces visible results without time-consuming pre-processing or expensive instruments. Lower cost tests and faster sample-to-result turnovers could result in more effective control of disease spread.

    This project seeks to develop a highly functional, sensitive, and specific diagnostic for the detection of coronavirus. This technology is based on the company’s Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The solution is a first-in-class diagnostics that uses algorithmically-designed structural DNA to form a trap that may detect and selectively bind a signature pattern of the pathogen. This recognition and binding may generate visual signals without the need of DNA/RNA preprocessing or amplification associated with the current generation of molecular tests (polymerase chain reactions, PCRs). This project will involve building a preclinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral flow based COVID-19 rapid diagnostics with a goal of providing results for each sample within 5 minutes.  This fast test result will be followed by preclinical validation to determine the test’s specificity, limits of detection, and implement mechanism to improve the assay specificity and to avoid cross-reaction to other virus types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide a more economical, scalable, and sustainable type of battery for storing the energy needed to support America’s growing renewable power grid. As more wind and solar power generation is being installed, there is a growing need for economical forms of energy storage to supply power during windless and sunless times. Older technologies like lithium ion and lead acid batteries are not ideal for this purpose due to problems with supply, safety, longevity, and sustainability. This project seeks to produce new chemical components to enable grid-scale batteries based on recyclable zinc metal, which offers a safer and more sustainable alternative grid-scale battery option. Furthermore, since zinc and its other battery components are sourced in the US, this project may help facilitate domestic battery manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign battery supplies.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to produce chemical additives that make zinc-bromine batteries last longer, hold more energy, and run more efficiently so that they can provide sustainable low-cost energy storage for renewable power. Presently, the major problems with these types of batteries are related to unwanted electrochemical side reactions that happen during battery charging. This project will eliminate these side reactions with stable, scalable, organic electrolyte additives designed to prevent problems at the zinc surface.  During this phase of the project, these electrolyte addititives will be modified and optimized for performance and scalability. They will be evaluated via testing in actual cells and full-size batteries by the battery manufacturers. By the end of the project, new class of enabling electrolyte may be available in large quantities to help establish safe, sustainable, domestically made zinc-bromine batteries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve distal extremity joint arthroplasty.  Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure to restore the function of a joint.  The proposed technology replaces cold knife, electrocautery, orthopedic saws and drills with a hand-held, all-tissue laser ablation system that fast cuts bone without necrosis. The effect is to reduce surgical time, create more precise cuts and drill holes, decrease recovery times, and reduce the need for opioid medications after surgery. The integrated visualization system may allow orthopedic surgeons to perform precise surgical planning that is difficult or impossible with current methods. While important in hips or knees, surgical precision is critical in wrists, ankles, and fingers/toes. The proposed device produced in this project may improve surgical success rates and reduce complications and revision surgeries, which will reduce patient suffering and excess healthcare costs. At the same time, the proposed tools may enable safe and successful distal extremity joint arthroplasty to be performed routinely.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an all-tissue laser-based orthopedic surgery system that integrates cameras for real-time, three-dimensional (3D) vision within a single handpiece. Conventional saws and drills compress and shear bones, causing postoperative joint pain and prolonging recovery times. A laser cuts by ablating tissue at its specific molecular absorption without killing the surrounding tissue (i.e., necrosis). One critical technical innovation in this project is to use a pulsed, high peak power, 9.3 μm wavelength carbon dioxide (CO2) laser that rapidly ablates hydroxyapatite (bone) and water (soft tissue). The laser pulse widths are chosen to approach the tissue’s Thermal Relaxation Time, TRT, which eliminates necrosis. Another critical technical innovation is to integrate various cameras (similar to smartphone and confocal microscope cameras) within the 9.3 μm ablation laser pulse train to provide real-time, high-definition, intraoperative vision. The proposed device may be enhanced to demonstrate sufficiently large bone ablation patterns, clinically acceptable bone ablation speeds, and non-tapered laser drilling tapering. The instrument will be housed in a handheld device that mimics existing orthopedic tools and will be run by firmware to perform at speeds necessary for clinical use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may enable the generation of as much as 65% of a building’s energy needs from renewable heating and cooling, reducing consumption by 13 Quads and saving consumers potentially billions of dollars. Buildings account for 28% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide and at least 2/3 of these structures will still exist in the year 2040. Achieving significant energy coset reductions will require a retrofit solution that is competitive with natural gas and grid-powered heating and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Such a retrofit must also be easily deployed in a wide variety of building types and architectures. The technology under development is a roof-mounted, panelized array that provides solar heat during the day and radiatively cools at night. The technology may be able to supply building energy resources throughout the year, a disruptive capability for a rooftop clean energy solution. The low cost and renewable nature of this resource may also insure that building owners and residents have access to carbon-free energy that is less expensive, less volatile, and more resilient in the face of interruptions to energy supplied from conventional gas and grid sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to validate a panelized rooftop technology to renewably generate heating and cooling resources for buildings. Dominant solutions combust fuel for heat and use grid electricity to power vapor compression for cooling. The proposed solution describes an array of thermal panes that convert a roof into an active environmental interface that continually optimizes the extraction and rejection of heat via absorptive, radiative, and convective processes. The technology continually operates in response to building energy needs. By modulating pane thermo-optic properties the solution enables fluid flow to alter the internal optical and heat transfer configuration. Evaluation of the technology will begin with manufacturing prototypes that incorporate novel thermal bonding techniques for integrating foamed polyiso-, fluoro-, and poly-olefin polymers. A solar simulator will assess efficiency and output temperatures, an iterative process to explore the role of internal fluid flows, visble and infrared radiation paths, and thermal loss mechanisms. An array will be subsequently deployed on a rooftop and coupled to the building energy system. Data will be collected to assess the impact on energy consumption and overall heating/cooling while developing control algorithms for pane modulation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovaiton Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable method to grow healthy produce for individuals residential consumers, independent of location, climate, or season of the year. Rotary aeroponic growing systems have the potential to reduce food waste, potable water consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions by decentralizing the production of highly perishable produce within a consumer's home. Growing fresh produce in the home may not require the use of pesticides or preservatives. Socio-disadvantaged individuals located in food deserts may benefit from an automated indoor gardening appliance by subscribing to low-cost organic seed pods that could be delivered and grown directly in their home, generate long-term returns on investment and lowering instances of obesity through healthier diets. Studying the effects of light interactions in a small rotary aeroponic appliance my encourage a new market for high margin seed pods that could be assembled in mass quantities by disabled individuals. Converting highly perishable goods into non-perishable, subscription seed pods may have the potential to reduce food prices and reduce instances of food insecurity throughout the world.

    Rotary aeroponic cultivation is the method of growing plants on a rotating cylindrical tower that is affixed vertically within a controlled environmental chamber. The key innovation in this project is the coupling of rotary aeroponics with tunable lighting to enhance the growing efficiency of the plants. Phase II research will examine how the wavelengths and timing of the lighting can impact plant photomorphogenesis.  The tower design is expected to provide a larger surface area for growing plants in comparison to traditional vertical farming methods, increasing the number of plants that can be grown in a smaller space with less power consumption. The goal of this project is to successfully grow a healthy polyculture assortment of leafy green vegetables in a food safe environment. The multi-spectral light will be used to learn how to maximize plant yields, minimize food safety risks, and enhance the taste profiles of different plant types to ensure the best user experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to potentially provide personalized hearing health care for those with hearing loss. Providing a customized amplification device and app solution that allows the user to understand speech more clearly may avoid audiologist appointments and allow the user to take control of their hearing right from their phone. Hearing loss is often associated with decreased employment and potentially lower income.  An effective amplification device may enable those with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to improve their employment and earnings.  Additionally, this technology may remove the discomfort that certain populations experience within the medical system and provide individualized empowerment in relation to their hearing.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to deliver personalized sound profiles from the comfort of the user’s home at a fraction of the cost of traditional hearing aid solutions. This self-fitting technology differentiates is differentiaed from the majority of over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer hearing solutions as the new technology allow the hearing aid enable personalize sound profiles in a variety of different listening environments. The technological goals are to allow users to optimize sound profiles in situ for live sound environments, and to standardize the software platform to enable partnerships with any hardware manufacturer in order to expand the suite of products that can help people hear clearly. The proposed project will continue the development of the technology including: increasing the range of frequencies that are adjusted during the self-fitting process, including the adjustment of non-linear gain parameters in the self-fitting process, an allowing users to obtain profiles for different listening environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to facilitate improved animal husbandry practices by providing high-performance natural supplements that can replace prophylactic antibiotics, drugs, and hormones. The use of medically-relevant antibiotics in animal feed initiated the spread of “super bugs,” causing a public health concern. Reducing the dependency on antibiotics in animal feed requires a concerted effort from multiple sectors. The outcome from this project may provide pragmatic alternatives to using antibiotics. Through research and demonstration, this project aims to overcome consumer skepticism towards accepting new supplements and contribute to maintaining profitability in animal farming even after antibiotics are eliminated from feed.

    The proposed project uses state-of-the-art computational tools in enzyme design to create new biocatalysts with tailored microorganisms. The resultant designer microorganisms with new functionalities may produce supplements used in animal feed using sustainable bioprocesses. A crucial component of the project is to design efficient bioprocesses that provide supplements that are fungible with existing supply chains, without the need for any additional on-farm infrastructure. Many natural supplements are either extracted from plants or produced using harsh processes, contributing to their expense. Successful completion of this project may overcome geographical or seasonal limitations in supplment production and represent the use of cutting-edge technology in the dietary supplements sector.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a technology for advanced geophysical density measurements and the monitoring of fluid fronts in soils based on the passive detection of naturally occurring cosmic rays. The primary application area for this project is the mining sector, where the technology may be able to drive efficiency improvements (up to 10%) in the recovery of copper and other key metals. These efficiencies could potentially result in a value opportunity of close to $1 billion per year in the US alone. The technology can also be applied to monitoring the stability of dams and levees, a widely-recognized ongoing concern, where it can provide safety and environmental benefits to the industry and society at large.

    The intellectual merit of this project is primarily related to both the continued development of field-ready instrumentation and of original data inversion methodologies. This includes: i) validation of the prototype sensor developed in Phase I under control conditions; ii) development and testing of fit-for-purpose conveyance and other hardware required for remote operation; iii) development of an original, three-dimensional data reconstruction algorithm driven by customer needs; and iv) development of commercially ready answer products and user interfaces. These innovations will serve to demonstrate the feasibility, technology readiness, and value of the proposed solution to the mining industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to serve the breast cancer community. In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology that will improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in combatting the U.S. illegal drug epidemic, which contributed to over 67,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. An affordable, effective field drug test system, superior to conventional color test kits and Raman-based test systems, would address this challenge, particularly because the widely used color test kits are outdated, hazardous, and susceptible to a high false positive rate. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit data analysis that will help LE reduce the supply of dangerous drugs from the communities they serve. This innovation has the potential to expand into other markets, including medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a novel system for on-site presumptive drug testing and collection of drug intelligence for LE. Conventional color tests are inaccurate and highly flawed, often resulting in failure to accurately detect common drugs and novel drug analogues as they are introduced into the illegal substance market. Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is equitable access to a quality science education regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location. Across the nation, science illiteracy is an ongoing issue with only 30% of students testing as having a basic knowledge of science. As a result, the U.S. does not have enough trained scientists to commercial or academic laboratories. This situation has been deemed a national crisis and is considered a risk to U.S. national security. A quality science education has lasting benefits to students including more persuasive and clear communication skills, and the ability to design and develop critical approaches to problem-solving. The long-term goal of this program is to raise science literacy across the nation and provide career readiness training for the next generation of scientists. The program meets all three dimensions of Next Generation Science Standards. A book version of the program is being rolled-out to independent study charter schools in California. The online program will be tested in schools which have adopted the books.  Both book and online versions will be expanded to charter schools, private schools, and eventually public schools. Modules of the program may be adopted in areas without access to high-speed internet.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses inequities in science education by providing an independent study application that includes step-by-step instruction for a hands-on chemical laboratory. All hands-on laboratories use reagents commonly found in the home for safety and accessibility reasons. Experiments are designed to be done without the need for a trained science teacher in the room. Studies show that hands-on learning is more impactful than computer simulations. Low-cost scientific equipment is also being developed. A hand-powered spinning centrifuge is under final design. During Phase II, a drug discovery module will be developed where students can find a potential cure for a disease in their own kitchen or classroom. Aims also include modifying the online application to make it easily expandable, scalable and maintainable for the long term. The application development includes technical optimization for reliable deployment nationwide and new interfaces to allow educators to upload content directly into the application. The project also includes security audits of the application including user information. Financial information will be managed through a third-party application. The product will be iteratively tested in classrooms and homeschools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is to enhance the scientific and technological understanding of designing lift-assist exosuits (mechanized clothing), an assistive technology that has the potential to impact society by reducing the fatigue, back injury risk, and back pain of delivery drivers. For employers, the exosuit creates the potential for reduced employee turnover and medical costs.  The proposed exosuit has potential commercial impact as the first and only lift-assist exosuit for delivery workers, a ubiquitous and growing job sector that cuts across nearly all commercial markets. This project could additionally impact the economic competitiveness of the United States by increasing the available workforce and reducing the cost of healthcare for Americans.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address key design challenges associated with assistive technologies that provide lift-assistance for delivery drivers. Surmounting this technical hurdle relies on two key features: (1) the ability to turn assistance on/off when carrying an object, and (2) the ability to sit comfortably for long periods of time while driving. The research objectives of the Phase II project are to: 1) add a new mode-switching capability, 2) integrate a unique method of disengaging assistance that maximizes comfort during sitting, 3) create a novel leg sleeve to maximize comfort when the exosuit is not assisting, and 4) carry out a field study to validate exosuit performance in real-world conditions. This project will combine technical requirements and user stories with a series of rapid design iterations. Using this approach, multiple prototypes will be designed, built, and tested with delivery drivers to assess real-world performance and user acceptance. This project is projected to result in a commercially viable exosuit prototype that fits the daily needs of delivery drivers, as well as objective and subjective evidence of its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the high costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) methods. HVAC constitutes approximately 48% of building energy consumption representing a significant cost to society. Much of this energy is generated by fossil fuels, resulting in substantial environmental impacts: carbon emissions associated with residential and commercial use are 35.6% of total US emissions.  Geothermal or ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) represent the most energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly HVAC solution currently available, however, their high upfront capital costs have significantly slowed their deployment. The innovation in the present project takes a fundamentally different approach to GSHP heat transfer, resulting in reductions of 50% in installation costs and 20% in operating costs compared to conventional GSHP systems, enabling an expansion of the geothermal market. The present project seeks to thoroughly field test and analyze the performance of the GSHP innovation, optimizing the fabrication and installation parameters, and readying it for commercial deployment.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address the high installation cost and large, disruptive footprint of conventional GSHP systems. The project objective is to demonstrate a compact, cost-effective, easily-deployable, renewable solution for HVAC. The advection-driven GSHP (AGHP) takes advantage of the 4-5 times greater heat capacity of water than rock. Under the present project, AGHP will advance beyond numerical and laboratory analyses to manufacturing and field testing performance under real-world conditions. The research objectives include: 1) finalization of field site, 2) preliminary design and numerical modeling of the AGHP system for a chosen field site; 3) engineering retrofit design; 4) fabrication of the custom designed submersible pump and heat exchanger; 5) installation and testing of the AGHP system; 6) operation, monitoring, and analysis of the performance of AGHP system, including the development of a comprehensive cost, energy use, and emissions model for the AGHP system; and 7) use of the compiled data to estimate the potential for the economic viability of AGHP in various regions of the United States. The anticipated result of this project is a commercially-ready GSHP product with design and installation guidelines for determining the potential for deploying the innovative AGHP system at any given location.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the replacement of steel with synthetic materials that are stronger and lighter. The beachhead market for this technology is the performance bicycle spoke market, which is a $180M global market. The potential benefits of this technology go beyond cycling because the polymer-to-metal interface has other potential applications. Cable assemblies are used in a wide variety of applications and industries such as industrial, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods. Advances in the termination of synthetic cable assemblies will enable the creation of higher strength-to-weight ratio cables and thereby increase efficiencies in transportation applications and improve the safety of tension based systems. An application of particular societal benefit is wheelchair wheels, where weight reduction increases portability for those with physical disabilities. Investment in termination technologies for high performance polymers will also help bridge the gap between polymer research and industry, helping society benefit from developments in polymer science occurring in academia. Finally, the ability to produce low-cost rope terminations will increase US manufacturing competitiveness because the majority of high-volume production is outsourced to low-cost labor markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced manufacturing process for ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and metal hybrid structures for bicycle spokes. UHMWPE has a strength-to-weight ratio of fifteen times that of steel, but it cannot be utilized in many applications because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-strength bonds to metal. The primary objectives of this research are to automate the insertion and bonding of stainless steel rods inside the hollow cavity of braided fibers, and to automate the creation of eye splices. These operations require delicate manipulation of fibers in a confined space, and are typically performed manually. Instead, we will develop novel automatic machinery that will create these bonds, inspect the final product, and validate the strength with 100% in-process inspection. Another objective of this research is to develop a black surface coating process for braided UHMWPE fibers. To achieve this, we will identify a surface pretreatment procedure to add functionality to the non-polar backbone of UHMWPE, develop the coating chemistry, and create an in-line coating system that integrates with our manufacturing process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create very low power and very high capacity optical interconnects for general computer applications. Computer performance is limited by the speed, power, and latency of connections between chips and memory. The limitations of electrical interconnects are well known, and optical interconnects overcome the limitations and offer 100-1000 times performance improvements. While historically optical interconnects have been hampered by high cost and high power, recent developments show that the promise of optical interconnects can be practically realized. Optical interconnects will dramatically improve overall performance of enterprise and cloud computing services, especially when used in data center computers, while reducing electrical power consumption. This will in turn permit a vast improvement in resource utilization and dramatic reduction in the cost of computation across all segments of society

    The proposed project will develop an optical peripheral component interconnect expreess (PCIe)-compatible transparent bridge for general computer interconnects. PCIe is the most prevalent interconnect used today in computers. The technology developed in this proposal, based on light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitters, multicore optical fibers, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photodetectors, seeks to  reduce electrical power consumption from ~10 pJ/bit for electrical solutions to ~100-200 fJ/bit. The use of LEDs leverages investments already made for cost and power effective LED lighting and displays. The small size of the LEDs and multicore fibers allows for data densities of >1 Pbps/cm2. Electrical interconnects and other optical interconnect technologies cannot compare with the performance of these LED based optical interconnects. These advantages enable physical disaggregation of the compute, storage, and memory functions, improving system performance and resource utilization. This Phase II effort is focused on the development of a PCIe-compliant transparent bridge for applications in chip to chip and chip to memory interconnects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the burden of accessing information for the 1.5 million blind people in the United States by making a full page of refreshable braille text and tactile graphics available in a device resembling a tablet computer. This assistive technology will provide increased access to braille in digital form and enable blind students to read, with their fingers, digitized spatial content including mathematical equations, graphs, and figures, creating parity with their sighted counterparts interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In particular, the product with supporting software will remove barriers to collaboration in classroom learning environments and document preparation in the workplace. The proposed product will improve braille literacy, increase opportunities to enter careers in STEM, and ultimately lead to the employment success and independence of blind Americans.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues efforts to adopt microfluidic technology in order to create a highly manufacturable full-page braille and tactile graphics display that uses pneumatic signals to actuate pins at braille spacing. The anticipated technical innovations shift certain drive functions from electromechanical hardware to the more cost effective and easily manufactured multilayered microfluidic substrate. Since the ultimate objective for this phase of research is to create an integrated system for delivering interactive braille and tactile graphics, the team will focus on designing the interactive experience by which blind users access, on demand, the textual and non-textual information that they desire. The anticipated outcome of this project is a seamless array of actuated pins in a tablet­ sized device capable of presenting a half­ page of braille characters and tactile graphic images.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this project centers on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals suffering from motor dysfunction due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and other conditions. In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks. Additional results include increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and turn-over.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of exoskeleton robots targeted at rehabilitation. A substantial portion of the US population requires intensive rehabilitation services for neuromuscular impairment. Robotic rehabilitation has attracted attention due to the potential for better patient outcomes. Current robotic solutions lack the anatomical mobility and compliant dynamic behavior to produce neurologically-sound therapeutic behaviors. The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior. In this project, the physical structures and control algorithms of the exoskeletons will be designed and built with a focus on dynamic transparency and kinematic compatibility with the human body to capitalize on the capabilities of the actuator. Additionally, the control software will use feedback loops and a visually interactive environment with performance metrics to keep patients engaged.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a safe, effective, and sustainably-produced natural sunscreen compound, gadusol, to replace harmful ingredients widely used in current sunscreen products. Two to three million cases of skin cancer are reported globally each year, including 132,000 cases of melanoma. In 2015, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reported 80,442 new cases of melanomas of the skin in the U.S. The potential exists to reverse this trend with effective, safe, aesthetically-pleasing sun protection products that provided long-lasting full-spectrum UV protection. Sustainable production of gadusol and the assurance of its safety and efficacy will enable such products to be developed. With a global sunscreen product market of $16.5 billion and growing, along with the demonstrated need for natural, safer sunscreen actives, this project is poised to have a worldwide, long-term impact on national and global health.

    This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of sustainably producing gadusol, a natural, marine-based compound with proven sun protection capability.  Recent research has documented that widely used sunscreen ingredients pose hazards to the environment and possibly to human health, leading to bans on popular sunscreen products. Mineral active compounds such as ZnO and TiO2 are safer substitutes but pose aesthetic disadvantages, leading to products that many consumers dislike. Gadusol has the potential to replace some of these widely-used chemical actives as a safe, effective, and natural UVB blocker. The technical scope proposed includes overcoming obstacles to sustainable production of gadusol using the tools of synthetic biology, establishing gadusol's safety through standard pre-clinical tests, and assessing its efficacy and suitability in prototype formulations (SPF value). Successful completion of this project will reduce the risks of adopting gadusol as a new sunscreen ingredient, enable its commercial production, and provide essential safety data prior to initiating clinical testing required for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make on-site hydrogen generation convenient and economically viable. Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure.  One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer.  The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype.  The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity.  The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the redefinition of the care of asthma patients. Asthma is highly prevalent in the US, with 25 million patients currently suffering symptoms, and was the cause of 1.7 million emergency room visits in 2015, resulting in a huge societal cost. A predictive platform that can identify when a patient is at risk of an asthma attack would serve to reduce such costs by allowing intervention in a timely manner, thereby reducing the number of emergency room visits by asthma patients. Through the combination of remote monitoring of patient lung function, local environmental sensing, and data analytics, asthma can be understood at a personalized scale, a dramatic shift in the standard of care for this chronic and complex condition. Additionally, the platform developed in this project can be expanded to other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or cystic fibrosis, broadening its impact. Ultimately, it is envisioned that this project will result in a world without asthma attacks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the development of a machine learning-based data analytics platform to identify in advance when asthma patients are at risk of an asthma attack, thereby enabling physicians to alter a patient's care plan and avoid hospitalization. To date, there is no integrated system to gather and analyze high-quality lung function and environmental data for asthma patients on a daily basis in order to truly analyze and predict a patient's health. As a result, asthma care is often reactive, requiring emergency treatment and resulting in poor clinical outcomes. The objectives of this Phase II research include the development and validation of a machine-learning based analytics model to generate new insights into the health of asthma patients; the development and implementation of a physician portal to translate such insights into clinical outcomes; and the development of new datasets to create a more robust and accurate platform. The result will be a live prediction platform to assist physicians in keeping asthma patients out of the emergency room.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is further advancement and maturation of a recently devised miniature electromechanical actuator technology with potential applications in the consumer electronics, automotive and biomedical industries.  Any electrically powered system with moving parts requires actuators converting electrical energy into mechanical motion.  This includes robots, surgical/medical micro-devices, precision micro/nano-positioning systems, and optical and ultrasonic imaging systems among others.  The market size for millimeter-scale electromechanical actuators embedded in compact camera modules (CCM) for Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Auto-Focusing (AF) alone is currently over $3B and expected to reach over $5B by 2025.  The same actuator technology can also be applied to a variety of other applications such as compact speakers, ultrasonic transducers, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project utilizes the newly established cellular electrostatic actuator technology to demonstrate a low cost, power efficient, high-performance solution for auto-focusing and optical image stabilization in compact camera modules.  Physical movement of the lens stack with respect to the image sensor is essential in cameras for Auto-Focusing (AF) as well as shake cancellation via Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).  Voice Coil Motors (VCM) currently used to address such functionalities are relatively bulky, slow, power hungry, and costly.  Enabled by the state-of-the-art micromachining techniques, force generating ultra-narrow electrostatic gaps within the proposed actuators offer high work output per volume with close to 100% energy efficiency.  Under this project, for realization of a viable product prototype, mechanical displacement amplifiers and shock absorbing structures will be designed and integrated within the silicon chips along with the actuators.  Comprehensive mechanical shock tests on loaded actuators as well as long-term electrical reliability and mechanical durability tests will be performed on the fabricated prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable electronic products of great environmental benefit and social value which cannot be economically made today. Among these are three important product classes that can deliver on the promise of the connection of everyday devices via internet (Internet of Things) and their rapid computing power. First, wearable devices (such as smart watches, health monitors, or activity trackers) must be smaller, thinner (often flexible) and less power-hungry than current versions. Second, low-power, high resolution displays with high brightness are needed to visualize results, even in direct sunlight. Third, the decentralized computers which collect, manage and process large datasets require designs that can easily manage sensors, process information, and control devices to support smart cities, smart vehicles, smart homes, and smart applications. The primary focus of this project is to enable the next generation of advanced displays, capable of substantial energy savings coupled with greater visual appeal. Broadly, the results are critical for enabling the cost-effective manufacturing of each of the three product classes, which all suffer from fundamental challenges in chip manufacturing and require innovation in packaging and assembly to be commercially viable at scale.

    The proposed project is designed primarily to make better displays possible. There is a widespread desire to make displays with ultrasmall light-emitting diodes (LEDs), enabling better contrast and color, sunlight viewability, longer lifetimes, lower power consumption, and lower cost. To do so, currently unsolved chip fabrication obstacles must be overcome. The main impediment is a cost-effective approach to place such small LEDs at desired pixel positions with adequate precision. The objective of the project is to meet this need, using a unique non-contact photopolymer-based method which transfers <10 um die with +/- 2 um accuracy at many thousands of units per second with high yield. The research will involve systematic study of the parameters of the process, including polymer composition and characteristics, film characteristics, pre-transfer bonding process parameters (temperature, pressure and time), and optical system parameters. Yield will be measured statistically and improved. While demonstrating actual throughput requires full-scale production equipment, the feasibility of meeting industry required targets will be demonstrated to the extent possible on lab-scale equipment.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals as well as enable large scale field monitoring and management in production agriculture.  The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to establish autonomous data collection under-canopy from field crops using a low-cost ground robot. The proposed work will enhance the ability to collect data autonomously in full-scale crop-breeding fields throughout the season and enable on-site data analytics for remote sites with limited connectivity. Long-term field adaptive autonomy will be achieved through implementation of multiple low-cost sensors. Robot's real-time control algorithms will be developed to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under-canopy field environments. Finally, the research will develop hardware specific edge-compute versions of the analytics algorithms to enable on-site data analysis. These innovations will together enable global deployment of the system for effective data collection and phenotyping.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to increase the competitiveness of the US in manufacturing high value parts for shops with high product variety, low volumes, large lead times, and large set up times.  The application addresses a need to find the optimal way of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries.  The technology may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers more cost competitive.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times, and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to accelerate the transition from chemical pesticides to non-chemical alternatives by providing farmers with a sustainable, long-term solution for managing pests, while reducing agricultural impacts on human health and the environment. Today, strawberry farmers are reliant on chemical pesticides, spending $2,500/acre on over 60,000 acres/year to support the $3.6 billion U.S. strawberry industry. Organic farms, representing 10% of the industry, lack effective treatment methods resulting in high labor costs and increased risk of yield loss. This project seeks to develop a system for using ultraviolet light as an efficient and equally effective alternative for chemical pesticides, disrupting the pesticide manufacturing industry by providing farmers with a healthier and more environmentally conscious method for treating crops. The solution may eliminate uncertainty associated with chemical applications, reduce labor requirements, and increase profitability for farmers. Additionally, technologies developed as part of this project will minimize human exposure to chemical pesticides and reduce the ecological damage caused by existing agricultural treatment practices.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel, non-chemical treatment system for commercialization of agricultural pest control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical pesticides, a global $84 billion market. Existing pest controls are ineffective due to insect resistance, cause uncertainty, and result in reduced yield and profitability. This project’s objective is to create a reliable, non-chemical treatment alternative that uses ultraviolet (UV-C) light to control multiple pests effectively and sustainably. The project team will build a UV-C treatment device with a dosing control algorithm for achieving reliable pest control in minimum treatment time. This dosing controller will use novel volumetric irradiance profiles to characterize the effectiveness of a treatment and adjust treatment time and/or distance to account for field uncertainties. The goal of this research is be a commercial UV-C treatment system integrated into an automated pest control system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II is to improve schedule-based maintenance programs to ensure that industrial and farming equipment can function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The downtime associated with such high productivity equipment can result in significant lost revenue, and research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. The proposed technology seeks to effectively reduce or eliminate this downtime, creating value for manufacturers. This project proposes a novel deep learning approach to predicting bearing failure in rotating industrial equipment and enable maintenance teams to confidently plan optimal maintenance activities around equipment that is in the process of degrading. This solution also aims to cost-effectively use a patented methodology to monitor industrial material handling systems with a combination of stationary and mobile battery-powered wireless sensors.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes a novel deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. Monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. The proposed approach may not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but also seeks to quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions may be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Additionally, many existing deep learning approaches also lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where poor predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This technology may allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.

    This proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.

    The broader impact/commercial opportunity of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from creating a paradigmatic shift in the way we achieve seismic protection. The use of mechanical metamaterials fosters new opportunities to increase current levels of seismic protection of buildings and infrastructure, which could ultimately increase the resilience of communities and save lives. Mechanical metamaterials are materials specifically designed to have unprecedented properties. Evolving from a traditional system-based design to a material-based design has the potential of creating seismic solutions that are more customizable and easier to install than most of the current technologies. This technology could replace current seismic protection systems that are traditionally aimed at saving building occupants' lives, but may not address the important equipment therein.  An enhanced level of seismic protection constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities and services requiring continuity of operations after earthquakes. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of increasing the resiliency of communities in seismic prone areas and reduce seismic related direct and indirect losses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for increasing the seismic resilience of our critical infrastructure, and in particular Information Technology (IT) facilities. The projects will result in a revolutionary advance in the seismic protection of vibration sensitive electronic equipment through the use of novel mechanical metamaterials made with an innovative hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) process. The feasibility of combining multiple AM processes to manufacture the multi-component internal architecture of such metamaterials will be demonstrated. In particular, the effectiveness of AM processes in combining hard and soft materials in a highly-complex architecture will be addressed, with the aim of enhancing the design space of the mechanical metamaterial. The effects of this enlarged designed space on the seismic resilience of IT facilities will be investigated by developing a specific seismic resilience framework. The framework will be used to analyze and compare the seismic resilience of data centers with traditional systems and highly customizable metamaterials, as resulting from the manufacturing process.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of the first minimally invasive cryoablation solution to treat high-risk patients with gallbladder disease. The current gold standard for treating gallbladder disease is surgical removal of the gallbladder. While this procedure works well for healthy patients, the use of general anesthesia has been shown to increase complications in elderly patients with underlying chronic medical conditions, leading to a $675 million cost to the US healthcare system each year. Furthermore, patients too sick for surgery have no definitive treatment options, underscoring the need for a safer alternative. Phase I efforts demonstrated the ability to safely deliver cryoablation energy via a minimally invasive catheter system to chronically defunctionalize porcine gallbladders without removal. Phase II efforts will focus on product development of the cryoablation system and optimization of clinical delivery parameters. The goal of the technology is to allow clinicians to provide their patients with the benefits of surgery, without the risk.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a minimally invasive cryoablation system capable of safely and effectively targeting the gallbladder. Initial testing of the cryoablation system has demonstrated the ability to uniformly generate lethal cryoablation temperatures (<-20℃) across the gallbladder lumen, leading to durable gallbladder scarring and defunctionalization in porcine animals up to 60 days post-procedure. Key technical objectives of this project are to develop the industrial design of the introducer, cryoablation catheter, and control system for improved clinical usability and manufacturability, to further test and characterize clinical delivery parameters to inform treatment planning, to improve sensor reliability and control system response time to optimize safety profile, and to validate the integrated system in vivo to demonstrate system performance with optimized dosing parameters. The system will be evaluated in an advanced benchtop model gallbladder under a thermal load, ex vivo gallbladder tissues, and an in vivo chronic animal model to optimize and validate the cryoablation catheter and integrated control system. The anticipated result of this project is a clinically viable gallbladder cryoablation system with established clinical delivery parameters and dosing guidelines.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address the widespread industry challenge of improving yield in compound semiconductor device production. Compound semiconductors with a wide bandgap are needed for high power devices in electric vehicles (EVs), high frequency components in 5G electronics, and energy-efficient displays. The compound semiconductor market, valued at $36+ billion in 2022, has increased recently with growing consumer demand for EVs.  The annual growth rate of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors, the most prominent devices, is estimated at over 20%. Despite the wide-scale production of these components in an industry that expects near perfection in manufacturing, the current yield of power electronic components is less than 50%. Poor yield results largely from an inability to adequately inspect substrates and epitaxial wafers used for power electronics. Instead, the industry currently relies on inspection tools with poor defect selectivity or destructive methods that can only provide statistical information about the defects in a wafer batch. To increase wafer yield, the team will develop a new type of optical inspection tool for selectively measuring defects in every wafer. If successful, this novel inspection technology will enable the industry to help drive down costs and increase performance of energy-efficient power electronics.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the novel way in which technology developed for use in fundamental science is being applied to rapid semiconductor inspection. The proposed method, called ultrafast imaging, uses the nonlinear optical response of a semiconductor induced by an ultrafast laser to isolate defects that measurably impact the electronic structure of the semiconductor. Though the semiconductor industry has typically focused on measuring morphology to find defects, measurement of compound semiconductors requires a tool that is sensitive to the electronic structure. This project will validate ultrafast imaging through benchmark testing against industry standards and develop an easy-to-use device for getting this technology into the hands of manufacturers. Partner manufacturing and inspection companies will provide inspection data and corresponding wafers, allowing correlation of ultrafast imaging defect measurements with data provided by other industry tools. Additionally, the team will develop and demonstrate an easy-to-use commercial product for user facilities and industrial research and development facilities, another essential step in the development of a high-throughput inspection tool. This benchtop product will not only improve current semiconductor technologies but will also be useful for scientists to characterize the next generation of semiconductors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Today, cUTIs account for 400,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Unfortunately, multidrug resistant pathogens are a common cause of cUTI. Many are resistant to the first-line antibiotic (Ceftriaxone), which is used as the empiric treatment of this condition. However, the high incidence of multidrug resistant pathogens causing cUTI delays the time until patients receive more appropriate treatment. Delayed time to appropriate therapy in cUTI has been attributed to extended hospital stays and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The current standard test for diagnosing a drug-resistant cUTI takes 2-3 days from obtaining a patient sample. Therefore, diagnostic tests that can rapidly inform the initial treatment of UTIs are urgently needed to improve patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a rapid urinary diagnostic test that will enable the detection of ceftriaxone-resistant uropathogens. Early detection of resistance to first-line therapies would enable antibiotic prescribing to be informed, reducing the risk of disease progression in patients. In the case of UTIs, disease progression can lead to severely invasive infections, predominately sepsis. Therefore, diagnostics that can detect resistance to first-line antibiotics enable early treatment interventions, reducing the time to appropriate treatment and reducing the risk of disease progression. Decreased treatment time also lowers the healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant cUTI, as disease progression is associated with increased lengths of hospital stays compared to susceptible infections. The completion of the Phase II project will yield the development of a prototype test that can provide actionable information regarding ceftriaxone susceptibility in less than 5 minutes. This project’s success will provide clinicians with a diagnostic solution for cUTIs that can be acted on immediately to improve patient outcomes and aid antibiotic stewardship by preventing the unnecessary use of inappropriate antibiotics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow recycled plastics to be used more efficiently and affordably than is currently possible. Regulatory and societal pressures are forcing reconsideration of single use plastics, and manufacturers of plastic film must use recycled plastic at higher quantities. However, it is difficult for the manufacturers to affordably reincorporate single-use plastics due to the low quality and unpredictable content of the material. Increasing yield of usable plastics through use of the proposed technology is expected to reduce waste, offering the potential to annually save 6.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the US and Canada, and 28 million metric tons globally. Also, the greater use of artificial intelligence in manufacturing is of strategic advantage to the US, with the proposed technology also applicable to metals, paper, or advanced materials. Furthermore, skills shortages are impacting manufacturing and are likely to worsen due to a rapidly aging workforce. A great deal of on-the-job expertise will be lost in the coming years as a generation of experienced operators retires. The proposed solution can ease this transition, acting as an expert decision system to carry the intelligence forward and help maintain US manufacturing competitiveness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will apply artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and process control methods to plastic film extrusion, and subsequently to other types of manufacturing. Currently hardware solutions exist for manufacturers, though they can be expensive, difficult to use and maintain, and can require specialized skills to use. By contrast, the proposed technology is a software-based approach to the control of complex plastic film extrusion processes, particularly in the context of widely variable input materials such as recycled plastics. The AI software will be robust to changes in the production environment and will account for process drift over time. These technology capabilities are industrially novel and not known in the academic literature. Phase I outcomes suggest that the technology can automatically control extrusion processes to achieve optimal steady state production faster than is the currently possible via human control. The AI-based expert system effectively recreates the knowledge tacitly held by long-experienced factory operators. This type of industrial automation has the potential to be value-generating for the wider manufacturing sector. The proposed technology may be applicable to a wider range of extrusion manufacturing processes, such as extrusion of metals, paper or advanced materials.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the growing need for accurate models and forecasts of the Arctic.  As Arctic maritime operations such as fishing, shipping, and mariculture of kelp are increasingly impacted by unprecedented climate change, traditional modeling techniques are unable to support these new demands. Ecosystems are not static, and their unpredictability hinders safe and sustainable economic development for communities. This modeling approach supports the economic competitiveness for Alaskan fisheries by increasing transparency of resources on short timescales (precision fishing) and long timescales (ecosystem modeling). The results could be used to identify new and emerging locations for fisheries, under- or over-fished locations, and differences between locations that can be restored or those that the ecosystem has shifted away from supporting. By applying dynamic ecology information, this project can provide tools to improve management of ocean resources, which could increase industry profits while simultaneously raising the total harvestable biomass.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II innovation is to create and refine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine capable of generating custom environmental models, making new and emerging science quickly accessible to the people and communities that need the solutions. The AI-produced software will integrate multiple types of scientific techniques from the fields of nearshore bathymetry models, habitat mapping, precision fishing, and Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) tools. Scaling the generation of tailored models provides cost effective, adaptable, and accurate solutions to ocean environmental challenges. Successfully executing this plan will require a combination of technical and computing skills; numerical modeling expertise; significant scientific literacy in remote sensing, bathymetry, sea ice, physical oceanography, and fisheries science; and the development and training of novel neural network architectures.  In Phase I work, remote sensing from satellites was used to map the nearshore in the prototype AI engine. Remote sensing from new satellite resources has enabled this effort of a deeper understanding of the world’s remote locations, like the Arctic Ocean. These data deserts can leverage satellites and pockets of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge to build productive, new economies that are resilient and adaptable.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable communities impacted by air pollution and extreme heat to design and implement solutions to these problems in a fast and cost-effective way. Air pollution increases the risk of cancer, stroke, heart-disease, and respiratory infections, and may play a role in Alzheimer’s and diabetes, resulting in human suffering and trillions of dollars of health care costs globally each year. Extreme heat is a growing source of additional health-care concerns and costs. These costs are shouldered by insurance companies, governments, businesses, and citizens. Air pollution can be reduced by carefully placed trees.  These trees also reduce extreme heat by shading and evaporation of water. There is potential for improving human health via targeted engineering of tree placements. This project will develop analysis and design tools to help with such tree plantings to generate the maximum possible health and financial benefits, at the lowest cost and with the shortest timelines. Local businesses can use this tool to make sure that they get paid fairly for reducing health care cost burdens of health insurance companies, governments, and pollution producers, while making communities and the environment more resilient.

    While existing literature indicates that trees may provide an effective air pollution and heat-island mitigation strategy. Stakeholders seeking to implement such strategies need tools to ensure that the plantings are as effective as possible. Existing planning tools are not of sufficient resolution or site specific, and often do not employ evidence-based design strategies. This project will perform high resolution vegetation analysis on a wide variety of neighborhoods. This data will be used to train a set of algorithms to infer high resolution vegetation properties from widely available, low-cost data streams. These inferred vegetation metrics will be integrated with a geospatial ecosystem design automation pipeline to create a software tool. The software tool will provide environmental justice communities, ecosystem designers, health insurance companies, governments, and local businesses with the ability to implement cost-effective ecosystem interventions with quantifiable air quality and heat island benefits. These benefits can be used to calculate financial health benefits. Because the benefits quantification will be based on ongoing validation and monitoring projects, the tool can be used to leverage private financing for improving public health and improving the environment.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project focuses on improving the management of chronic disease by enabling team-based primary care is key to achieving clinical results and taking advantage of new “value based" payment reforms. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, six out of ten adults have a chronic disease and 90% of the national annual healthcare expenditures are spend on people with these conditions.  Our technology proposes to apply precision-education instructional theory to enhance primary care team competencies and promote situational awareness, enhanced communication, defined role clarity, improved coordination and leadership support to improve patient outcomes which is directly aligned to the National Science Foundation’s mission of promoting science to advance the nation’s health.  This project is being designed for commercial use in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which serve one in twelve people in the United States.  There are 1,373 FQHCs in the US serving 27 million patients annually in medically underserved areas. Public and private payment models are rapidly moving toward incentives/bonuses for team-based care and demonstrated outcome improvements. Improvements in the cost and outcomes of care for this patients with chronic disease will have enormous social and economic benefit for the Nation.

    This SBIR Phase II project uses machine learning to integrate individual-level clinical and social characteristics into suggested treatment paths and to apply precision training techniques that improve the skills of individual members of the care team. Our objectives focus on validating the feasibility of machine learning to provide health professionals with recommended workflows and continued education based on trends and gaps in care identified from patient data. The method includes a computational engine to guide reinforcement learning. Machine learning has made possible the development of statistical models to establish effect sizes of clinical interventions, enabling personalized instruction and support to health team members based on patient outcomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the ability to enable a safer, more reliable, and more resilient electric power system. A reliable and efficient grid is the cornerstone of the nation’s economy. With the rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), a transition from conventional generation plants to utility-scale wind and solar farms, and the threat of cyber- and/or physical attacks on the bulk electric system, ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid has become ever more challenging. The software being developed in this project will help grid planning engineers and operators cope with these modern challenges. For the first time, engineers from organizations across the utility industry will be able to collaboratively plan the grid on a secure, scalable, cloud-based software platform that provides the capabilities needed to fully assess the impact of renewables and DERs. The software’s industry-leading simulation robustness will allow users to analyze extreme contingencies, cascading events, and weak grid scenarios to develop preventive and corrective actions that secure the grid. The software is designed to support an annual $50B+ in US power infrastructure investment and an annual $400B+ in power market transactions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software for electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) planning.  Technical tasks are to: 1) Make cloud architecture responsive to demand with autoscaling and queueing services; 2) Architect results generation for minimized data storage requirements; 3) Manage data handling for reduced re-loading of datasets; 4) Implement a file parser for industry-standard three-phase unbalanced distribution system models; 5) Implement models of common distribution system components; and 6) Extend the cloud platform to support integrated T&D analysis.  Integration of these optimized components will lead to an improved system engineered for usage at scale.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project\
    \ is to significantly improve the economics of lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling,\
    \ while minimizing its environmental impact. Direct recycling uses less energy\
    \ and generates less pollutive waste and fewer emissions than alternative recycling\
    \ approaches, while simultaneously producing more valuable products. The proposed\
    \ project will advance the development of a recycling technology that will lower\
    \ LIB cost, reduce the reliance of LIB production on the mining of expensive virgin\
    \ metals, create a local supply of LIB materials, and facilitate the adoption\
    \ of clean energy products (e.g., electric vehicles, grid storage). \n\nThis SBIR\
    \ Phase II project proposes to develop a cost-effective and scalable direct recycling\
    \ process at a pilot-scale level. The proposed project will study LIB deactivation,\
    \ component separation, purification, and regeneration processes that can be economically\
    \ reproduced on a large scale. For example, a battery deactivation process that\
    \ is quicker, safer, and cost-effective can be used in other waste management\
    \ processes as well to discharge batteries. This project also will enable a better\
    \ understanding of the key parameters of electrode extraction and purification\
    \ processes able to preserve electrode chemistry and morphology. By focusing on\

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a novel waterless rock fracturing technology that can replace hydraulic fracturing in the future.  Hydraulic fracturing requires pumping of millions of gallons of water into a reservoir to create permeable pathways within the rock, and increase hydrocarbon recovery rates. However, hydraulic fracturing technology has been banned in some regions within the United States, and in various countries across the globe due to water scarcity and environmental concerns. This has left trillions of dollars in petroleum resources trapped within the earth, negatively impacting the global economy. The waterless fracturing technology being developed under this project utilizes pulsed electrical energy to fracture rocks instead of water, allowing for hydrocarbons to be recovered with minimum environmental impact. The research conducted during this project will provide further insights into the advantages of utilizing electricity to fracture petroleum reservoirs and assist in accelerating successful commercialization of the technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel electric reservoir stimulation method to increase reservoir permeability without requiring pumping of hazardous material into the subsurface. This project will advance the development of an electric stimulation method by testing it on rock samples under higher pressure and temperature conditions, to mimic the downhole conditions of several common petroleum reservoirs and allow for optimization. This project will also include the design of a downhole tool that will be utilized to carry electrical current from the surface to the target reservoir for field demonstrations of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the most common problems with complex prosthetic hands: lack of robustness, lack of waterproofing, lack of sensory feedback, and high cost. This project will advance the development of waterproof multi-articulated hands with a touch feedback system, offering an affordable solution to restore confidence and independence to over 10 million amputees worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the work done in Phase I to develop an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. The work in this proposal will involve advanced mechanical design techniques necessary for waterproofing a multi-articulated prosthetic hand. Additionally, the project will advance the development of a variable grip strength, semi-automatic contact reflex system to improve the range of manipulation tasks possible with upper limb prosthetic devices. Technical tasks include: 1) development of contact reflexes through integration of position control, pressure sensing interface, and speed control for both fine, compliant manipulation of delicate objects and gross manipulation of objects requiring high grip force; 2) waterproofing to an IP67 rating, a significant technical challenge because of the many potential points of ingress and required level of manufacturing precision;  3) the mobile application user interface; and 4) standardization for manufacturing at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is addressing the growing societal need for indoor air purification, as indoor air quality (IAQ) directly affects human health, productivity, cognitive function, and quality-of-life. Awareness of the long-term consequences of poor IAQ has recently witnessed an increase due to research results, improvements in monitoring and sensing technology, public awareness campaigns by organizations such as the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, and Environmental Protection Agency, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding sustainable, economical, and effective solutions to the problem of poor IAQ will greatly benefit public health and wellbeing and will help curtail the spread of pathogens, minimizing the need for social distancing.  This project will develop a new system air purification, addressing viruses, harmful chemicals, odors, and ultrafine particulates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to scale up the production methodology and coating process of novel catalytic materials. The materials are 3D nanostructured porous powders that are designed at multiple length scales to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and longevity, while reducing costs and utilizing raw materials in an environmentally responsible manner. The system uses a synthetic approach based on self-organization of nanoscale building blocks and wet chemistry tools in order to assemble finely structured coatings for integration in air-purification units. This project focuses on expanding it to production scale, wherein achieving control over the composition, structure, porosity, and placement of nanoparticles on a production scale is challenging.  The materials platform development will include adaptation to high-throughput instrumentation and scale-up of the material production and coating process to pilot production. In the process, this project will develop tools and guidelines for manufacturing hierarchically-structured functional materials more generally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address major deficits in mathematical achievement among children living in the United States, and to develop new modes and approaches to learning with mobile technology. A growing body of research shows that the human brain is most receptive to learning math concepts in the pre-school years and that children who do not receive appropriate instruction at this early age often fail to achieve in mathematics later in life. This is of particular concern because mathematical ability is highly correlated academic success and future jobs increasingly require strong math and problem-solving skills, resulting in significant implications for the competitiveness of tomorrow’s workforce. This Phase II project will develop a next generation education technology that guides families and children through a series of learning activities, performed mostly off-screen, but which are guided an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile learning application. This technology supports new approaches to learning and has applications in the commercial sector as products using natural language processing (NPL) continue to proliferate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of new learning technologies that can encourage parent child interaction and aim to increase parent engagement in learning experiences with their children (ages 3-8). A cloud-connected mobile applications will provide regular opportunities for parent and child to build early math and problem-solving skills in age-appropriate, meaningful contexts. Machine learning algorithms deliver activities that match developmental milestones, learning objectives, and family interest. Animated characters guide users through activities both on and off computer and prompt meaningful conversations by asking both parent and child open-ended questions. AI technology analyzes recorded feedback to obtain the degree of engagement by considering nuances such as voice tone, phrasing, and number of conversational turns.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project impacts mothers and babies during the breastfeeding period. Although breastfeeding benefits for the mother and the baby are recognized worldwide, many mothers are unable to attain their breastfeeding targets due to common discontinuance problems. The proposed solution may increase breastfeeding rates by supporting mothers who are breastfeeding or breast pumping, providing them with resources to sustain breastfeeding. Access to valuable information on the volume of breastmilk expressed could enable mothers to carefully monitor their milk production. At the same time, it may allow the prediction of clogged milk ducts, avoiding serious complications such as breast engorgement or lactational mastitis that can be avoided with early intervention. This intervention could prevent not only early discontinuance in breastfeeding but also promote increased health for mothers by reducing the risks of disease. The monitor may also impact babies’ health since breastfeeding is recommended to achieve optimal growth and development. Further, the proposed monitor may provide the scientific community with data to enable research into different aspects of mothers’ health, for example, determining the reasons for the formation of mastitis.

    This project may lead to a new paradigm in lactational health for the baby and the mother. There is an important need to meet breastfeeding objectives by reducing discontinuances and reducing common conditions such as lactational mastitis. The proposed solution aims to increase breastfeeding rates by providing mothers with a comfortable and effective method for measuring the milk volume expressed and for determining if milk ducts are clogged. Research objectives include: (1) sourcing and testing fabrics for the bra from multiple vendors; (2) designing and developing of the embedded system and the bra, so that will be able to accommodate a wide range of breast shapes and sizes; (3) designing and developing mobile applications and algorithms, which will include data analytics and prediction; and (4) optimizing the bra and mobile applications. The project could result in a smart, all-day wearable, comfortable garment designed for breastfeeding mothers that is paired with a mobile app to show analysis and results adapted to each mother.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a label-free, biological sample preparation and cell isolation platform for recovery of rare cells from a variety of sample inputs. Specifically, by carrying out sample preparation, manipulation, and monitoring on a single chip platform for selective cell recovery, the sample handling steps will be greatly reduced, thereby ensuring the maintenance of cell viability, improving sample consistency, and sustaining native cell behaviors. This recovered sample is essential for the development of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine and cancer management. Personalized medicine also requires precision cell recoveries.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an electrically functional microfluidic sample manipulation platform for phenotype-selective recovery of cells, based on their biophysical attributes. Specifically, microfluidic designs will be integrated to swap cells from complex biological inputs into an optimized buffer to enable cell manipulation. Also, instrumentation will be developed for on-chip monitoring of the sample during various stages of the phenotype-selective cell recovery process. Further, a variety of sample inputs will be validated on the designed devices to ensure performance, consistency, and reliability for translation into commercial product lines.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project proposes continued development of a directional microwave ablation (MWA) system. During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicator’s tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.

    As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of low-cost, flexible displays allowing smart objects to better communicate with their users. Researchers estimate that in 2017 there were 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that were not computers, estimated to grow to 125 billion by 2025. These Internet of Things devices are already used in many applications for transportation, health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. These devices can enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety; they will require displays that are thin, low power, flexible or curved, and easy to read. A near-term need is autonomous transportation, which will need a method of visual communication between vehicle and rider.  This project will develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays; just this initial transportation application will help improve mobility for the elderly and disabled, traffic safety, and related needs.  In the longer term, this project will enable manufacturing of improved displays with reduced processing waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix (OLED) displays. These displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography, a slow and expensive process. The high-resolution printable anode developed here replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process, laying the foundation for fully roll-to-roll printed displays.
