Submit your Project Pitch</a>

Each small business can only submit one Project Pitch at a time.

A small business may only submit one Project Pitch per submission window. A small business is permitted to resubmit its Project Pitch (with revisions to address any deficiencies) in a future submission window. (Please reference the solicitation for submission windows).

Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal, or which has a full proposal under review, must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new Project Pitch.

An invitation to submit a full proposal is valid for one year.
